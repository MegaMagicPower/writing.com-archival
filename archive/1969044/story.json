            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah jogged back to her apartment, stopping by the staircase and bending down to catch her breath. \"Alright...ha...another five miles run today. Good job, Sarah!\" She stood back up, taking in more deep breaths before going up the steps. Five miles, every day. That had been Sarah's routine for the last month. Before that, it was seven miles, but she was tapering to she could regrow some muscle. All in preparation for the show of fitness her job was putting on next week - nine days away, to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah slowly walked up the stairs, wiping sweat from her brow and taking down the headband she had on to keep her long blonde hair in check while she ran. Reaching for the door, Sarah turned the handle. Or, she tried to. It wouldn't move. \"Hmm,\" Sarah mused, trying the handle again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" a voice said behind her. Sarah turned around to see her roommate Britney walking up, a box in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney, I'm so glad you got here,\" Sarah sighed with a smile. \"There's something wrong with the door. It won't move for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it...locked?\" Britney said, reaching into her pockets for her keys. Sarah paused and thought over her roommate's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Sarah was a bit spacey. She wasn't stupid, just spacey, sometimes gullible and absent-minded. Still, Sarah managed to stumble her way through life and even get a good job at the local gym, where she was pretty well-liked by the other regulars and employees. Well, maybe not all of them, but their time will come later in our story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney opened the door and walked inside, putting the box down on the kitchen table as Sarah stretched out her arms and legs just outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it says it's for you,\" Britney said, pointing to the label. \"I just picked up all our mail downstairs and this was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Sarah exclaimed excitedly, rushing forward and opening the box. \"I remember now, I did order this. It's a new energy health protein drink with anti-oxidants and pomegranates and kale and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Britney said skeptically as Sarah opened the box all the way up. \"That sounds like a lot of crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was on the commercial online. All of those things are good for you,\" Sarah said, shaking her head at Britney's disapproval. \"I mean, aren't energy and protein and kale all good for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, sort of,\" Britney said, looking at the dozens of packs of canned energy drink Sarah was unloading. \"How many of these things are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, this was the smallest order they had,\" Sarah said, staking the cans on the table. \"We'll probably have to hold this somewhere else in the apartment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, this is already nearly a dozen packs of drinks,\" Britney said. \"This must have cost hundreds of dollars. Do you really think that's a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's the best part!\" Sarah said gleefully. \"The website only charged five bucks for the whole thing! It's from some new company, Yaral Industries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral Industries, huh?\" Britney said, taking one can. \"Well, I've never heard of them, that's for sure. Is this even safe to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Sarah said, rushing into her room and bringing out her laptop. \"Here, I'll show you the information on their website.\" Sarah went to the site for Xpect, clicking on a YouTube video embedded on the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a commercial, Sarah,\" Britney tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! It's starting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue screen appeared with pleasant music. A young, attractive woman appeared, smiling in athletic gear. \"Xpect Energy Drink! Product of Yaral Industries! Just one can and you'll feel like a whole new person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took a can and chugged it in one smooth motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect Energy Drink. Fills you full of life! No consumption under the age of 18.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under 18? Geez, is there alcohol in this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush Britney,\" Sarah said. \"Want to join me in drinking one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney sighed and looked over the can. It looked like it was packaged legitimately. It had a cool black case with a big white X for the logo. \"I don't know about this, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, c'mon! I need energy and protein for the fitness competition at work next week. It's a gym! A good performance could mean more clients for personal training, maybe even a higher position. Now let's drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney shrugged and both pulled back the tabs and took long drinks, just like in the commercial. Upon finishing, both felt a sudden twinge in their stomachs. \"Ugh, I feel nauseous after drinking that thing. Sarah, that was terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, things that are good for you are supposed to taste bad!\" Sarah said, holding her hand over her stomach. \"That's why you shouldn't eat apples!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Britney said, bending over in agony. \"Urp...I can't argue with you...I'm going to be sick.\" Britney ran off to her own room. Sarah could hear her barfing across the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's you throwing up your toxins!\" Sarah said, holding her hand over her mouth. \"Ooh, that is bad.\" Sarah bolted for her own bathroom and eagerly threw up in her toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of vomiting, the two went back into the main room, Britney looking at Sarah with an exhausted expression. \"So...believe me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shrugged. \"Maybe. I'll have to try it again tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney rolled her eyes. \"Well, let me know how that goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, wondering how her day would go with this nausea hanging over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Swallowing the nausea deep inside her, Sarah picked up a few cases of the Xpect drink. <br>\r\n\"Where are you taking those things?\" Britney asked, still holding her stomach. <br>\r\n\"To work. We've got some many of them that I can bring a few cases to work. My boss has been looking for an official drink to tie-in with the gym, and I maybe I can to him this energy drink. It'll be a simple process: I'll get my work-out class and a few of my personal clients on it, have them tell my boss how much they love it, and then with the fitness competition in 9 days, we can make it the official energy drink of the gym, and with it being so cheap from that website, we could order hundreds of cases of it, and sell it for a huge markup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I can get my boss to sign on it, it could be huge for me, huge for him, huge for my clients, huge for my class, and huge for the gym\" Sarah said, unaware of her soon-to-be ironic in-the-future words she was saying. <br>\r\n\"Do you really think you can get your class to take it?\" Britney asked, plopping down on the couch, trying to rest after her bout of explosive nausea. <br>\r\n\"Sure. My all-girl work-out class would love something like this. I mean, most of the girls in their are in the later 30's to mid-40's, single and/or divorced, you just have to pitch them the wonders it could do to their bodies. I mean, it's not called Femme-Fit class for any old reason\" Sarah finally finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good luck\" Britney said, pulling a sleep mask over her face. <br>\r\n\"You're just going to sleep while I'm gone?\" Sarah asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm exhausted. And starving.\" Britney replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah herself was feeling both exhausted and hungry, but she pushed the thought aside. She needed to work, and she planned out her caloric intake DAYS in advance, which was how she stayed in amazing jaw-droppingly sexy shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good luck with that\" Sarah said, grabbing a few cases of the energy drink and heading off to her car. After shoving the cases back in the trunk and backseat of her car, she turned over the ignition and headed off to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinging along to some pop-song on the radio, Sarah's mood improved tremendously. She had seemingly forgotten all about the neusea or the gnawing hunger that was slowly creeping up to the point-of \"uncontrollable\". She pulled into the mall-sized parking lot of \"MegaGym\", which was less of a gym, and more of a fitness megaplex. A huge 3 story building that featured boxing rings, treadmills, an olympic indoor swimming pool, practically every thing you could ever imagine. A huge banner hung outside the building of the gym, along with dozens of signs that read \"MegaGym Mega Fitness Show - Clients and Employee Categories. Sign up now. Huge cash prize!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked in her employee parking space and grabbed the case of drinks from the back before walking into the front doors of MegaGym. <br>\r\nUpon entering she was hit by a cacophony of noises, personal trainers screaming at the top of their lungs to tell people to \"Push It! Push It!\", the sounds of TV blaring as people exercised in front of them, among other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting down the drink on the front desk counter, she typed in her employee number and punched herself into the system. Her job as a trainer and class teacher was a pretty sweet one. Hourly wages as well as bonuses for personal clients who met their fitness goals. As a fitness freak, getting paid to stay in shape and help others and get paid for it, really made everything better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were almost late Sarah\" Rebecca said from behind the check-in desk with a cackle. Rebecca, Sarah's frienemy and rival, was almost the exact mirror image of Rebecca, except with fiery red-hair. \"Oh you know how it is. You go for a five-mile jog and -  - - Well maybe you DON'T know how it is\" Sarah said, shooting back friendly vitriol. \"And what do we have here?\" Rebecca asked, grabbing a can of Xpect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a new product I'm going to have my Femme-Fit class try. Once it's a hit, I'm going to pitch it to the boss and then that promotion and raise is mine\" Sarah said with a smile. Rebecca opened the can with POP, and smelled the drink. \"If this thing dosen't kill everyone first\" Rebecca said, putting the can to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, it's meant to give you energy and cleanse your body of toxins. I've already had a can this morning, and I feel fantastic\" Sarah lied, but it was okay as long as she could get people hooked on this stuff. It's not like it could hurt anyone right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca took a big long gulp, before putting it down, a weird expression crossing her face. \"Great stuff huh?\" Sarah asked. \"Uh - yeah\" Rebecca said, finishing off the can before throwing it into the recycling. <br>\r\n\"Here a take a six-pack. Pass it around to everyone. Make sure they know you got it from me and this gym!\" Sarah said, picking up the case and heading of towards the changing rooms, unaware that moments later Rebecca was puking her guts out into a near-by trashcan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging over into her sleek skin-type blue leotard that hugged and showed off her every curve, Sarah grabbed the rest of the drinks and headed into her Femme-Fit class, where her twenty or so \"pupils\" were waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon ladies\" Sarah said, grabbing her leg behind her and stretching. Her \"class\" as she called it, was twenty or so women, aged from 18 to 65, whom were actively serious about getting in shape in a safe womanly environment. While some of the women were married, most of the class was made up of late 30's to late 40's singles and divorcees who were trying to get in shape for today's competitive dating market, while one woman, Theresa, was in her mid-60's and just wanted something that would make her feel young again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for taking, we have a lot to do today. So let's get going!\" Sarah said, putting on the CD and leading the class in a variety of exercises from yoga, to cardio, to aerobics and more. After the time with the class came to a close, Sarah brought out the stack of Xpect and presented it in front of the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, I have a special treat for us. I know some of you don't like or aren't into energy drinks, but I've found this great new product called Xpect, and let me tell you something, it's fantastic. It gives you such much energy and flushes your body of toxins! I have cases of this stuff since this gym will start carrying it exclusively soon. I want each and everyone of you to drink a can now, to get back into you electrolytes and energy you've just spent on this exercise. Some come on, I won't take no for an answer!\" Sarah said, handing out a can to each woman in the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched one by one as each woman in the group opened the can and drank it, some of them chugging it, others like Theresa slowly and cautiously drinking it, afraid it might attack them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone take another can with them and give it to someone they know. Tell them where they can get it and how much it's changing your life! And I'll see everyone back here the day after tomorrow!\" Sarah said, dismissing the class, unaware of the \"gravid\" consequences that were quickly unfolding out of sight of Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's class met every other day, and one of those days would be 9 days from now on the day of the big \"Fitness Show\" that she and many of the women in the class would be participating in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToweling down the sweat, Sarah looked at the clocked and wondered her next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her class over, Sarah threw her towel over her shoulder and grabbed her exercise bag, still full of cans of Xpect. The nausea had been feeling was muddled with the relative exhaustion of the workout, so she was in a small haze of good emotion. Sarah's personality made it pretty easy for her to snap into a happy mood and the surge of post-exercise serotonin helped that along. At every opportunity to talk about exercise, Sarah was always talking about the \"happy chemicals\" that the brain releases afterwards. Whether it was actually serotonin, or true at all, was not something she double-checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had her task for the day complete, Sarah thought now would be the best time to plug the drink and see if she could get in good with the boss. Sarah put away her headset and continued toweling off as she walked through the main exercise room. There were treadmills and ellipticals, all kinds of weight machines, and abundant room for exercise mats and wall mirrors. Other gym goers passed a considerable number of glances at her as she walked by. Sara had a great body and her sweaty session made certain special parts of her upper figure glisten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only reason I come here at this time,\" one middle aged guy with thinning hair on an exercise bike smiled to his buddy on the bike next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that,\" his pal responded. \"Although today she looks a little green around the gills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main lobby, Sarah joined her fellow MegaGym employees in the break room. They were chatting casually about their days' workouts and the upcoming competition, taking long sips from their water bottles. Sarah came in with a smile, glad so many people were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everybody!\" she beamed. \"Listen, I just came across this great new health drink that you've all got to try. It's made with so much protein and quinoa and blueberries and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry, the crossfit trainer, held up one hand. \"Wait a sec, Sarah. No offense, but I'm not into those kinds of fad supplements. They're usually snake oil. I just exercise and eat right.\" Terry was a pretty tall, typical gym instructor. Short blond hair, muscular, and facial hair a few tones lighter than a 5 'o' clock shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you won't say so after you've tried this,\" Sarah said, already rummaging through her bags to get out Xpect cans. \"It's done wonders for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? How long have you been taking it?\" Lori, the swimming and water aerobics instructor, asked. Lori was much shorter, a bit above five feet, with  long almond hair and tan skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours,\" Sarah said, handing out cans as the other employees looked up at her perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few...Sarah, you're a great trainer, but some time you can be so gullible about things like this,\" Jim, the yoga teacher, said. Jim was mid-height with a solid core of muscle. His black hair was naturally a little spiky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really, it's great,\" Sarah said. \"It cleans your body out almost immediately to start preparing it. I just gave some to Rebecca and my whole Femme-Fit class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this?\" said Emily, MegaGym's owner. Emily was around the same age as the rest of the instructors but had the look of an 80s aerobics instructor. Her hair was black and curly and hung down to her shoulder blades. She had penetrating blue eyes, so much so that it nearly looked like she had eye shadow. Even in her office, Emily had been wearing a full body exercise leotard. You'd think she missed the casting call for an Olivia Newton John video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, great!\" Sarah smiled, handing Emily a can as well. \"I actually wanted to try and get MegaGym to partner up with Xpect Energy Drink. We don't have much sponsorship and getting ahead of something like this, especially with the big competition coming up, could really benefit the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took the can in her hand and looked it over, as did the rest of the room. \"I don't know, I've tried to steer us away from partnering with things like this. Terry put it the right way: these things are usually crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it out and you'll like it,\" Sarah said, smacking her tongue around in her mouth, feeling the barfy taste coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't hurt to just try,\" Lori said, popping the tab and taking a sip. Terry, Jim, and Emily all shrugged and did the same. Immediately, Jim dropped his arm back down, cheeks puffed out in disgust as he swallowed, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, oh my god,\" he choked out, running for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Namaste!\" Sarah called out as Lori and Terry held their hands over their mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really...really going to...hrrng,\" Lori said, burping a little as she and Terry left the room. Sarah, still with a blissful smile on her face, turned to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Sarah said in a chipper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily held her head back, finishing the whole can in one drink. \"Hoo...well Sarah, I can see what you meant about the 'cleaning out.' I'll...I'll get back to you about this. Excuse me.\" Emily closed her office door, the sound of vomiting quietly emanating from behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar smell and sound of nausea dug up similar feelings in Sarah, so she headed out the room. <i>No need to get all the toxins out here</i>, she thought. As Sarah tried to find somewhere else to talk to coworkers, she came across one in the main exercise room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nina!\" Sarah smiled. Nina was Sarah's best friend of all her coworkers at MegaGym. Nina was about eight months pregnant. Or at least Sarah thought she might be. Her friend insisted in telling her in weeks and Sarah didn't keep track of it all that well. She was big, it was sufficient to say. She also had a red pixie cut and pale skin with lots of birth marks peppering the front of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah,\" Nina said, a little sadly. \"A bunch of people just ran out of the employee room. Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everything's fine,\" Sarah said. \"What's up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina sighed and shrugged. \"I'm still not getting anyone to sign up for the pregnant exercise class. I can't teach any regular classes and this is the only way to keep working until the baby comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you have to take a break, it'll be okay,\" Sarah smiled. \"And you'll get more people, I'm sure. Hey, you'll definitely get more people after all the attention the gym's going to get after the fitness contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Nina said. Like Sarah, she was a bit spacey and could get cheered up very easily. Sarah also had a naturally bright and sunny personality that could bring someone out of the dumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That reminds me! I'm trying to get a tie-in with MegaGym, the contest, and this great new exercise drink,\" Sarah said, getting out a can of Xpect. \"Here, try it! It's amazing.\" Nina didn't even hesitate before taking a long drink. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it tastes pretty bad, but most of these things usually do. It makes me feel almost like I want to throw up, but I get that every now and then, thanks to this little guy,\" Nina said, running her hand over her belly. \"Or this little gal. We want it to be a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"That's part of the healthy effects! Let me know how you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Nina said, finishing off the can and tossing it inside the recycling. The magic in the can, resonating with some kind of strange power from eons and dimensions past, squirmed with excitement. Even it didn't know what would happen next with what just took place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with her work spreading the good word about Xpect around MegaGym for the day, Sarah-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unaware of the \"Gravid\" chaos she just seeded at her place of employment, Sarah left MegaGym with a smile on her face, for sure that she just convinced all of her co-workers, and more importantly, her boss Emily, to chose Xpect as the drink of choice for the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock, she uttered a small swear under her breath, and walked back to the car. Putting her gym bag, still holding a few cans of Xpect, in the backseat, she got in the front and buckled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach emitted a low rumble, and she felt as if she hadn't eaten in the history of forever. She had.... a craving? Nonsense. She didn't crave. All of her meals were pre-planned for perfect nutritional  value. Still... Pizza could be good right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head, trying to get the almost insatiable craving out of her head, as she started the car and drove back home. The ride home itself was uneventful, but that was to change as Sarah climbed up the flights of stairs to her apartment floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer apartment floor was home to four people. Apartment One was home to The Hamiltons, David, age 45, his wife Trisha age 47, and their twin daughters Laci and Maci, age 19. They moved in a little while ago while they were building a home in a suburb in town. Unfortunately, some shady practices by the construction company has left the partially finished house in limbo as The Hamiltons wait for some court decisions before they find another contractor to finish the job. Something about property lines, building materials or something, Sarah didn't quite remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir apartment was quite big, the biggest on the floor actually, so it's wasn't like they were crammed into a tiny tin can. David worked in an office, doing something that Sarah couldn't quite remember, while Trisha was a nurse. The girls were attending the local college. Laci was 6'3, thin, busty, and GOTH. She was so goth she probably shat bats. Her lipstick was black, her eyeliner was black, her hair was black, her earings were black, everything as black. Sarah remembered the goths from High School, and was surprised to learn that old fads die hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci on the other hand, was a total valley girl, if in fact, the town they lived in was in a valley. Bleached blonde hair, blue contact lenses, low cut tops that showed off ample cleavage, bright red lips, blue eyeshadow, short shorts. She drove the men nuts, and she knew it. She loved using her looks to get whatever she wanted, but that didn't make Maci a spoiled brat. She was smart, hard working, and above all chaste. She was in it for the thrill, and what was a few dinner and movie if she didn't have to pay? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext door to Sarah and Britney, was Ms. Hilary Perkins. Ms. Hilary Perkins, as everyone called her, was a her early 60's. She lived by herself, and talked to of the neighbors on occasion, but struck Sarah as woman who just wanted to be left alone, and many granted that request for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApartment Three was home to \"Superstar\" Sabrina. A red-headed bomb-shell in her early 20's, her claim to fame that she was in a commercial that one time that some people vaguely remember seeing at something o'clock in the morning. She claims that she's \"an actress\" but most people see to remember her as \"The Secretary In The Tight Dress\", because she the curves to fill them out. She claimed that she was going to be a \"big star\" one day, but Sarah always wondered when. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApartment Four was home to the newlyweds Tami and Andrew Smiths. Just married, they moved into an apartment, although Sarah wondered why as they were never in it half of the time. They were always traveling to museums, going on trips, or whatever it was that newlyweds did without kids. The Hamiltons were wondering when the Smiths would start popping out young ones, which as Sarah overheard was a strong and firm \"Never\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sarah!\" Dave Hamilton said, waving from the apartment door. \"Hi Dave\" Sarah smiled back. \"Getting back from work today?\" Dave asked, his eyes non-shalently eyeing Sarah's body in her workout gear. He did this every time he saw her in her outfit, and she didn't mind. Men will be men after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just closed a big deal at the gym today. I got us to sponsor this new energy drink for our big fitness expo coming up. Check it out\" Sarah said, opening up her bag and pulling out the cans of Xpect. \"Xpect?\" David asked eyeing the can. \"It's amazing. It's made from all natural ingredients and really cleans out your body of toxins\" Sarah said, pitching the drink to her neighbor. \"Really?\" David said looking at the can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. And we - - Oh hey, Laci. Maci\" Sarah said as the valley girl and the goth pulled open the door to see who it was from their side. <br>\r\n\"Hey\" they said in unison, Laci never once looking up from her black, heavy metal band logo covered smart phone, while Maci twirled her long blonde locks with her finger. <br>\r\n\"Girls, Sarah has a new energy drink. Sounds pretty great. Think we should try it?\" David said, handing a can over to Laci. <br>\r\n\"Whatever\" The girls said in unison, not looking up from their phone or playing with their hair. <br>\r\n\"Think I can get a few cans for us?\" David asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you were much into energy drinks Mr. H\" Sarah said, handing out 3 additional cans of the drink.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not usually, but these girls here slam these things, and I figure, hey let's try to see what makes these things all the rage huh? YOBO; You're Only Born Once, #AMIRITEGIRLS?\" David said, trying to be hip and cool, and failing so epicly, eons from now, it will be recognized as a historical event worthy of study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" The two girls said in unison, cracking open their Xpect cans, chugging them together, tossing the cans into recycling and then leaving without ever saying a word other than \"Whatever\" <br>\r\nDavid laughed and said \"College kids\" before drinking his can of Xpect. He took one last can, saying he'll make sure his wife will drink it when she gets home, his face looking unusually pale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation ended sometime later by a strange bought of nausea, from the three members of the Hamilton family, but Sarah felt fantastic. If she could get everyone else on her floor hooked on this stuff, she could push them in the direction of MegaGym.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she went knocking to each door, successfully getting each person on the floor to try Xpect. Each. Single. Person. <br>\r\nIt was like a dream Sarah thought. It was almost like the were hypnotized into not saying \"no\". Finishing up her task with the Smiths, the sounds of puking being softly heard behind their door from both husband and wife, Sarah returned to her apartment (passing along the door to Ms. Hilary Perkins, whom seemed to be also experiencing a toxin cleanse of her own after trying the drink). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brit! I'm home!\" Sarah said in a delightful sing-song voice. Not only had she (in her own mind) pitched Xpect to her co-workers and boss, she managed to sell the drink to everyone on her floor! Maybe she could sell this stuff door to door! She could make some serious extra money! <br>\r\n\"Brit?\" Sarah asked, looking around to find Britney asleep on the couch, her hands resting on her midsection, with a huge smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what you're dreaming about\" Sarah thought, opening the fridge and grabbing a large salad she prepared for herself earlier in the day. <br>\r\nShe grabbed a few pieces of chicken to put in the salad, but a groan of protest from her stomach, made her drown the once healthy salad in chicken and ranch dressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill healthier for her than the pizza she was craving, she sat down and ate the salad with a ravenous hunger. She practically licked the bowl clean by the time she done. Letting out a small burp after words, Sarah looked over at the clock and felt more tired than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird. Wonder what's got me so sleepy today?\" She asked stifling a yawn as she contemplated staying up or getting to bed early. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah stretched her arms out, the yawn she tried to suppress getting out. \"Mmm, I guess there's nothing wrong with an early bedtime,\" Sarah said to herself, walking like a zombie to her own room. Once inside, she let out another burp and held her hand over her tight abs. \"Ugh, I still feel kinda bad from the Xpect. Hopefully in the morning the nausea will be gone.\" She changed out of her clothes, still stained and a bit stiff with sweat. Sarah contemplated stepping into the shower but changed her mind at the last second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look in the mirror told her that she didn't look too good. Her eyes had grey bags under them and her lips were a little chapped from her repeated vomiting. Sarah looked down at her fit, sexy body, resting one hand on her stomach and pressing gently. That settled her lousy feeling some, so Sarah continued to rub and feel her bare belly. \"Nice and flat, and gentle soft skin like pastry,\" Sarah sang to herself with a little smile. \"That's why we go to the gym!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried brushing her teeth, but had to stop every few seconds as her tooth brush set off her gag reflexes. She opted for a swig of mouthwash instead and headed back into bed, unhooking her bra and snuggling under the blankets. \"This stuff really took its toll on me,\" Sarah groaned, seeing a can of Xpect still left on her desk. \"I bet I'll feel amazing in the morning now.\" In no time, Sarah was off to sleep, drifting deeper and deeper into the unfolding dream world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina was at the front of the gym, in her athletic top that just covered her breasts and her little shorts, shuffling back and forth, sweat dripping off of her big belly. \"Alright, good, now we're going to pull, just like me. Ready?\" Nina said into her headset, pump-up music playing from the speakers above the class. Nina stretched one arm out and pulled it back, switching from arm to arm as she continued to hop around, belly and breasts jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class in front of her, all hugely pregnant, some impossibly so, did the same. It was all kinds of familiar faces: Brittany, the Hamiltons, the Smiths, Mrs. Perkins, Sabrina. Although Sabrina and Laci seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with the exercises. It wasn't just because their bellies were nearly five feet in front of their bodies. If anything, that made them below average in this class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now to do some leg work, here's my friend, Sarah!\" Nina said, and in came Sarah, with a belly dwarfing Nina's like Jupiter dwarfs Io. Sarah didn't seem to mind, though. She was smiling as always, her blond hair in a ponytail, her bright baby blue tank top covering up about as much of her as Nina's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello future moms and dads! Now, we're going to get those knees up! I know, sounds a little scary, but we can do it!\" Sarah said. \"Ready? 1-2-3!\" Sarah started lunging her legs up, and the class followed along, with plenty of grunts and whines from some of the less athletic and larger bellied members. \"Don't worry if you feel your babies start kicking! They're just exercising along with you!\" Sarah laughed as she took her arduous steps along with the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her section was done, Sarah toweled off her forehead, Nina waddling over and smiling. \"Everybody, say thank you to Sarah! And with that, we're done. Cool down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget to replenish any nutrients you lost through your sweat with a can of Xpect!\" Sarah said, waving to the crowd as she waddled out of the main gym, hands on her hips, taking deep breaths to recover her strength. Sarah waddled to the pool, where Lori, Jim, Terry, and Emily were already bobbing around, looking like icebergs with huge bellies floating above the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pre-natal class done?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it gets bigger every day,\" Sarah smiled, rubbing her belly. \"And it's not the only one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come in and relax,\" Lori smiled. \"This is the only way I don't feel heavy. Well, besides looking at your belly by comparison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bombs away!\" Sarah laughed, jumping into the water. As she hit the water, its lines blurred and bubbled, turning grainier and grainier until it was like static. Then the static cleared and there was just a white background and a table with a can of Xpect. The woman from the commercial stood there with the same soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect Energy Drink,\" she said, taking the can and drinking it all down in one long, smooth sip. As she drank, her belly swelled more and more until she looked absolutely ready to pop. \"Fills you full of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snrkg,\" Sarah snorted, suddenly opening her eyes awake. She looked around, confused, a tiny spot of drool on her pillow. \"Oh, that was just a dream...it felt so real,\" Sarah said to herself, rolling onto her back in bed, rubbing her eyes. \"Weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took a deep breath and smiled. \"Mmm, I don't feel nauseous anymore...great!\" Her bubbly, happy demeanor snapped back into place and Sarah threw her covers off, happily putting on her exercise outfit and going for her morning run. \"Bye Britney!\" She said as she left, waking her roommate off of the couch. Britney groaned and started to get up, noticing her hand still on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird dream,\" Britney mumbled, pressing her hand against her belly curiously. \"Great, that stupid drink ended up making me bloated. It looked like it was all sugar anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah went for her run around the neighborhood, noticing that her breasts felt more painful during this run. Like they were bouncing around more often, while still feeling her sports bra's constraint more tightly. \"I can just get a new one from the gym store,\" Sarah remarked, taking quick, consistent breaths as she turned each corner. Little did she know that this method of breathing would come in handy in eight days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her run, Sarah-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catching her breath and checking her watch, (somewhat disappointed that she added time onto her normally short morning run today) she decided to head back to her apartment to shower. She didn't have work today, another benefit upon the mountains of benefit she already had working with MegaGym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually worked every other day thanks to her Femme-Fit class, but when hired on as a personal trainer she could work seven days a week, while still juggling her Femme-Fit class. It didn't bother her much, the money was fantastic and so was the exercise. But today, after that strange dream, and the bloating, she could use a little time to chill out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back towards her apartment, she heard from voices coming from the Hamilton's apartment. <br>\r\n\"It's okay honey. I was like this all day yesterday and early this morning. It's our bodies flushing out the toxins. I told you that last night when you drunk it and were sick. I'm sure it absolutely fine. No, I'm sure the girls are fine too. There's no reason to panic.. What? No, I haven't gained weight, what are you talking about?\" She heard Mr. Hamilton say loudly to his wife over the sound of retching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sounds like they still have the nausea. Should be expected with how they eat. I feel fantastic on the other hand. </i> Sarah said with a smile, heading back into her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah is that URK!\" She heard Britney call from her bathroom. \"Yeah it's me. Are you okay?\" Sarah asked behind the door. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm find just feeling a little URK!\" Britney said, before the digusting squishy sound of sick hitting water was heard behind the door. <br>\r\n\"Don't tell me your still de-toxing your body?\" Sarah asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney ate what Sarah ate, her meal and exercise plans an almost perfect clone of Sarah's, why would she still have toxins in her system? She should have been cleansed after yesterday. \"I guess, that drink really URK!\" Another one of Britney's sentences cut short. <br>\r\n\"Well, are you still going to work today?\" Sarah asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney worked at a high-end lingerie store for women, where she sold (and often times modeled) high end ultra-sexy lingerie to sell. It was part of the reason why she kept in such great shape. When men saw her in the lingerie they were buying for \"their wife\" or \"their girlfriend\" they often would buy several more pieces at Britney's request. It was hard for a man to say \"No\" to a woman who liked like Britney is sexy pink barely-there lingerie, and since Britney made commission, it wasn't like she wasn't going to upsell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Just give me a few\" She said from behind the door. Sarah shrugged and went to the kitchen to have herself some breakfast: Some cereal with  no-fat milk, an apple, some no-sugar added orange juice, a single piece of high-fiber toast with nothing on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of hunger came over her, and she felt an insatiable craving for more. So instead of stopping at just one serving, she went for two, adding peanut butter onto the toast, and in generous helpings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe devoured her second helping of breakfast, as her room-mate came out in her uniform. Sarah noticed that her room-mates... assets were larger than she remembered as she could see the distinct outline of her nipples through her pink shirt. \"Not wearing a bra today Brit?\" Sarah asked, chewing on the last portion of her globbed-on peanut butter toast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It was WAY to tight this morning. Like it didn't fit or anything. I swear it's like my tits grew overnight or something. And they're so sensitive or something.\" Britney said, guiding her hands over her breasts, trying to show off that they were indeed slightly bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah said nothing, gulping down her toast, trying to drown out the massive alarm bells that were going off inside of her head. <br>\r\n\"I uh, don't know what to tell you\" Sarah said. <br>\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do today since you don't have a client?\" Brit asked, massaging her breasts once more. <br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to hang out with Diana. We hardly ever see hear anymore\" Sarah asked, trying to resist the urge to examine her own breasts that felt slightly larger to herself as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when you see her, give her my best. Tell, I'll have to see her soon.\" Britney said, picking up the keys to her car. <br>\r\n\"Not getting anything to eat?\" Sarah asked, starting to clean up her breakfast mess. <br>\r\n\"No time. I'll get something on the road. I have such the strangest craving for a breakfast burger. Don't give me that look. One breakfast burger won't kill me. When I come back tonight, I'll do some laps in the apartment's pool.\" Britney said, putting the kibosh on a long lecture about \"eating right\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well see ya\" Sarah said, washing her dishes and putting them in the dishwasher. <br>\r\nBritney was out the door, her mind clearly preoccupied by something, but Sarah wasn't going to take a guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah headed off to the bathroom, stripped down and took a look at herself. Her breasts were bigger, no doubt about it. They were sensitive too, her nipples starting to turn a slightly darker shade closer to brown. She ran her hand along the small bloat of her midsection and let out a sigh... Hopefully the bloating will go down soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering and drying off, Sarah changed over into her day clothes, a pair of tight jeans (that she could barely button due to the \"bloating\") and a<br>\r\nbright jean T-Shirt bearing the MegaGym logo. She tried another bra, but after struggling to snap it shut and having her breasts feel like they were being smushed to death, she decided to forgo the bra, and let it all hang out, pulling the green shirt over her torso. Much like her room-mate and friend, her nipples pointed out through the alarmingly snug MegaGym T-shirt, pointing out like little witch-hats under the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" she said, channeling Laci and Maci, unaware of the alarmingly similar changes the goth and the valley-girl were waking up to at this exact moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialing her friend Diana on her phone, she waited a few moments before her friend picked up on the other end. <br>\r\n\"Long time, no talk to\" Diana said. <br>\r\n\"Well, I've been busy. You ready for this?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n\"To hang out with one of my best friends ever and get away from all this chemical bullshit? Do I even need to say yes?\" Diana asked. <br>\r\n\"Met you at the mall then?\" Sarah asked. <br>\r\n\"See ya there.\" Diana said, hanging up on her end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana Larsen used to the Third Musketeer in the Dynamic Duo that was Sarah and Britney. However, sometime after college they drifted apart as Diana got a high-paying job at Trionic Chemicals as an Chemical Engineer, while Sarah and Britney just kind of.. did there own thing. Diana was always the Einstien of the group, a legitimate genius among the average.  Diana's work with Trionic kept her busy but she always tried to find a way to make sure that she worked out with Sarah and Britney and hand out with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah packed up her purse, and grabbed her car keys, when she noticed the can of Xpect looking back at her silently from the nightstand. Shrugging, Sarah grabbed the can and put it in her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind her, Sarah walked to her car and drove of to her destination to meet her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, she pulled into the parking lot of the local mall, and walked inside, waiting at their usual space by the center fountain. Sarah waited, and waited, and waited some more. If one thing Diana was not, it was punctual. Humming something to herself, her eyes kept drifting over to the massive Baby Universe store located in the mall, something inside her urging her to go in and look around. It got so bad, the she actually felt herself lift a foot and prepare to step into the store when she heard a familiar friendly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late. Traffic\" Diana said. Diana Larsen was just like Sarah and Britney is every way, slim, sexy, except Diana had a slightly smaller bra size and wore thick glasses that hide away her deep green eyes. She brushed aside her strawberry-blonde hair, and gave her friend a big hug. <br>\r\n\"Sarah.. did you.. get a boob job?\" Diana asked, pulling away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Sarah asked, a little offended. She was a natural beauty who believed in natural beauty, about being true to one's self both in psychical fitness and appearance, as well as mentally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boobs are bigger!\" Diana said, cupping her friends breasts in the middle of the mall for everyone to see. \"Look, they're spilling out of my hands! Are you crazy! You're always so against altering your natural appearance!\" Diana said, jiggling Sarah's boobs lightly in hear hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her lip as a wave of sensitivity washed through her body. It took her a moment for her to recover before grabbing Diana by the wrists and knocking her hands down. <br>\r\n\"No, I didn't, and stop doing that\" Sarah said, her face turning red from embarrassment. <br>\r\n\"Well, you must have because your boobs are huge to me. Like seriously, monster bazangos\" Diana said, looking at Sarah's chest with an almost x-ray like stare. <br>\r\n\"Look, stop looking at my chest okay? I didn't get any kind of surgery okay? Now let's just shop and have fun, like the old days before you got that job\" Sarah said, turning her attention away from her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine. Let's shop\" Diana said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed, as it always did when someone was having fun, as Sarah and Diana shopped and had fun together just like the old days. <br>\r\nThey caught a movie, a hilarious romantic comedy that Sarah didn't quite catch the end of because suddenly out of nowhere her nausea reared it's ugly head and she spent the last 15 minutes of the movie in a toilet stall puking her guts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was more than happy to recap the end of the movie in which our brave nerdy hero protagonist Jack married his child-hood sweetheart Jessica after she won the pregnant bikini contest, ensuring that they had enough money to start their new life together. Overall, she gave the movie \"Heads or Tails\" Two-And-A-Half stars. It was an interesting premise to be sure, a nerd falls in love with old sweetheart who gets mysteriously pregnant, and it had some real sweet moments in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did some more shopping, Sarah finding it somewhat alarming that some of the clothes she tried on she had trouble fitting into, but with the clothing market these days, the size it says is usually a size smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed so more, and Sarah's stomach let out another groan of hunger, which caused Diana to smirk. \"Hungry aren't we?\" Diana asked. <br>\r\n\"You heard that?\" Sarah asked, somewhat embarrassed. <br>\r\n\"I think everyone heard that\" Diana teased. \"Come on, let's eat\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into the \"Colorful Mug\" restaurant in the mall, and was seated by a waitress named Connie. After she left, Diana and Sarah continued to talk. <br>\r\n\"What's the matter Sarah, you look exhausted.\" Diana asked, taking a drink of her water. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just exhausted. It's this new energy I've been trying. Made from all natural stuff, its supposed to clean your body of toxins. I've been puking for the past two days but I really feel it working\" Sarah said, pulling out that single can of Xpect from her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked over the can with a scowl on her face. \"Xpect: Fills you with life\" Diana turned the can this way and that way looking for something.. anything on the can, other than the logo. <br>\r\n\"Where did you get this?\" Diana asked. \"There's no ingredient lists or nuturional values on it or anything\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, I got it off the internet. Here let me show you\" Sarah said, pulling out her phone and showing Diana the commercial. <br>\r\nAs Diana watched the commercial, Sarah saw a serious look come across her friends face. <br>\r\n\"I've never heard of this or Yaral Industries before\" Diana said seriously. <br>\r\n\"They're new. It's their first product, I was\" Sarah was interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I mean I'VE never heard of them before. Look, the company I work for, Trionic Chemicals, does alot of testing of food and beverages products on the market for the government. Every day we gets hundreds if not thousands of names for companies and products like these, and I'm telling you, I've never heard of them. Any company that want to sell something on the internet has to submit to be tested and have nutrional values put on the can. This hasn't.\" Diana explained very seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n\"So EVERYTHING. This stuff could be dangerous. You didn't drink this did you?\" Diana asked. <br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. It's an energy drink duh\" Sarah said. <br>\r\n\"That could be bad. Did anyone else drink this?\" Diana said, suddenly taking out a notebook from her purse and writing everything down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah panicked. If this stuff was untested and dangerous and Diana found out that she gave it to almost everyone she knew, it could be catastrophic. She could loose the deal with the gym, she could loose her job, hell, she might even end up in jail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. I just got it for me. You know, fitness freak\" Sarah lied. While she should have been conceded, Sarah was convinced that Diana was just overreacting. She was worry-wart, and always thought everything was going to doing something to someone. This was just another in a long line of unfounded warnings that Diana used to issue. Hell, Sarah remembers that back in College, Diana was convinced that something she ate once gave her testicular cancer, despite well... you know the obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you had any strange symptoms other than the vomiting?\" Diana asked taking notes. <br>\r\n\"Uh..\" Sarah thought. <br>\r\n\"Well I had a strange dream in which I and everyone I knew was pregnant. Even men. Does that count?\" Sarah asked. <br>\r\nDiana stared back blankly at her. <br>\r\n\"Dreams about pregnancy, including men who are pregnant.\" Diana said back slowly. <br>\r\n\"Uh yes.\" Sarah said, slightly embarrassed. She had no idea why she had that dream last night but it all felt..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand absentmindedly made it way to the small bloat on her midsection. <br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll put it down as halluencations. Anything else?\" Diana asked. <br>\r\n\"Uh, breast sensitivity\" Sarah said softly, hoping to keep that on the DL. <br>\r\n\"Uh -huh.\" Diana said writing it down. <br>\r\n\"And uh, lack of energy. Increased appetite.\" Sarah continued. <br>\r\n\"You said decreased appetite?\" Diana asked. <br>\r\n\"No, INCREASED appetite\" Sarah corrected. <br>\r\n\"Any strange or unusual cravings?\" Diana asked continuing the line of questioning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you ladies ready to order?\" Connie asked, ready to do her job. <br>\r\n\"Give us just a minute\" Diana asked, slightly annoyed at being interrupted. <br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm ready to order. I'll have the double-bacon double-cheese burger, with extra fries, extra mayo, a tall cold milkshake, and no onions please..\" Sarah said, giving her order. <br>\r\nConnie wrote down the order.<br>\r\n\"Actually, give me double onions please. Weird, I usually hate onions.\" Sarah said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Got it\" Connie said. \"And you ma'am?\" Connie asked.<br>\r\n\"Salad. Fresh. Light oil and dressing please. Nothing else\" Diana said matter of factly. <br>\r\n\"Okay\" Connie said as she left, leaving Diana staring at Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah asked slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"Did hear yourself order. So unlike you\" Diana said.<br>\r\n\"So I wanted cheeseburger. Just because I'm a fitness-freak doesn't mean I can't splurge every now and then. Believe me, I'll work it off later tonight\"  <br>\r\nSarah said with a smile. <br>\r\nDiana nodded and wrote UNUSUAL CRAVINGS under the list of symptoms. <br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just stop this please? I'm fine okay. This drink isn't poison, it isn't going to kill me or mutate me, or have me grow horns. It's just an energy drink I bought online okay? This is just like the undercooked Pizza Pocket incident all over again\" Sarah said, snapping at her friend. Her emotions and mood were all over the place today. <br>\r\n\"You said you would never speak of that again\" Diana shifted in her seat uncomfortably. \"Look, I'm just concerned okay? Look, I'll drop it, but I want this drink okay. I want to run some tests on it back at the lab. Just to be sure\" Diana said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine take it.\" Sarah said, whatever ended this line of questioning. The conversation turned onto other things, and as their meals arrived, Sarah hungrily devoured her food, like she has never eaten before. After she done, Sarah let out a cute little burp and cleaned the corners of her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Phew, I'm stuffed. I can't believe I ate all that, but it's okay. I'm going to work it off later believe me!\" Sarah said with a smile. <br>\r\nDiana just looked on in worry, and the magic fluid inside the can of Xpect just sat and waited in joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana and Sarah said goodbye, Diana grabbing the can of Xpect, promising to get to work on it immediately and get back to her asap. <br>\r\nSarah walked back to her car (which seemed to be harder than before as day turned into evening) and went back to her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into her parking space, and walking up the steps to her door, she noticed that the usually busy hallway of the apartment floor was eerily empty, as if the occupants were busy with something else. Shrugging it off, she turned the key and entered. A blinking red light on her answering machine showed her that she had a message which she played. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, it's me. Look, I'm going over to MegaGym after work tonight. I think.. I think I'm getting fat or something. Before I left work I caught sight of myself in the mirror while wearing nothing.. I don't know. Maybe I should have been more truthful in my diet. I've been sneaking snacks every now and then. Guess it finally caught up to me. Don't wait up. See you in the morning. I'll say hi to all your co-workers for you.\" Britney's voice on the machine said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah put down her packages and kicked off her shoes. She looking over at treadmill, and turned on the TV. Stripping down to her panties, she threw caution to the wind and set out exercising in the nearly nude, watching some kind of show on pregnancy and fitness on the TV. She had no idea why she watched it, but she felt oddly calmed as she watched the bouncing exercising bellies on the moms-to-be on the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief cool down, exhaustion washed over her. She took a quick shower, and skipping dinner because of her massively caloric lunch, crawled into bed and call it a night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sarah draped her covers over her, she went to sleep almost immediately, bobbing and stretching pregnant women dancing through her head. This was just as calming as the exercise video and Sarah was lulled adrift, counting bellies like sheep, a little smile even crawling across her lips. Britney came into the apartment a few minutes later, still in her workout clothes, groaning and rubbing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I really pushed myself too much,\" Britney complained to herself. It was her own fault. Finding a slight bulge, the beginning of a potbelly, frightened Britney into exercise that was more fitting for someone training for the Iron Man competition. Britney was athletic, like Sarah, but didn't make a career out of it. Still, she'd signed up for the competition like anyone else and was actually looking forward to seeing how she stacked up against some of the regulars at MegaGym, including Sarah herself. \"Having an empty head probably makes her lighter and faster, though,\" Britney chuckled before groaning again, rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate before working out and now felt dead tired. Britney slumped her way into her room, slipping out of her blue, stretchy (although a bit less so now) outfit and stepped into the shower, all too aware of how her workout did not immediately slim her down as she rubbed soap and water over her expectant curve.<br>\r\n\"Some energy drink,\" Britney grumbled. \"You throw up for a day and a half, then get fat. I can't believe I drank any of it in the first place.\" Britney ran her hands through her hair. \"At least my hair feels silkier, but that might just be getting the sweat out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, Britney slipped on a t-shirt and rolled herself up in her blanket, drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Diana---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlocks and blocks away, Diana was just getting out her equipment: microscope, petri dish, measuring instruments, and various other chemicals to test reactions with the mysterious Xpect Energy Drink. Diana looked the can over, still puzzling over its lack of any traditional health markings. It was like the can was nothing but advertising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing online didn't help solve the mystery any. All Diana got was that same cryptic commercial Sarah showed her. The gorgeous woman drinking Xpect and repeating the slogan in a breathy voice to the viewer. She found a copy of the ad that had been uploaded to YouTube by a third party. There weren't many views, but the comments ranged from \"best purchase I ever made! Changed my life!\" to \"DO. NOT. DRINK. THIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Diana poured a few drops onto her petri dish and got out her dropper and chemicals. \"Alright, first test. Let's see how high the sugar concentration is in this stuff,\" Diana said, drawing some clear liquid. \"This should react with any fructose and turn the stuff a little blue.\" Diana already made a note about the drink's strange color. Sure, things like Coke and Pepsi were dark colored, but this was...black. Pure black. Like looking into a starless night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana applied her solution and, to her surprise, it just dribbled off. No change. \"Hmm. Well, let's test for sucrose next,\" Diana said, getting another dropper and performing the same experiment. Again, nothing. \"Weird. Just glucose?\" Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana leaned back and made some notes. \"Well, I didn't expect that. What kind of gimmicky drink isn't even going to put sugar in? Alright, next, test for carbonation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning out the petri dish, more Xpect was poured in than before. It sat still as Diana drew up her next solution. Then, it started to fizz and bubble. Violently. Diana covered her lips to prevent any getting in her mouth but still watched the concoction with surprise. This wasn't like a regular soda or energy drink's bubbling. It was almost like it was boiling. Diana stuck in a thermometer. Room temperature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Diana applied the solution, and again, nothing. \"No carbonation? Then how is it doing this?\" Diana said to herself, looking back at her petri dish and seeing a clear, pacified surface. \"This is weird. This is really weird stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana reached for her phone to call some of her co-workers about this. She'd need some help to analyze this stuff. Besides, it was late and she didn't feel like much more work. As she got out her phone, the Xpect started to fizzle loudly, startling Diana and making her drop her phone under the table. \"Damn,\" she said, crawling under to get it. Then she heard a rattling. Looking up, the can began to shake with bubbling until it fell over, the rest of its contents falling onto Diana's face and open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Diana said, standing up quickly, phone in hand. \"That stuff really does taste bad.\" As she started to dial, nausea began to slowly wash over her. \"Wow...that's...hrk!\" She left her phone on the chair and ran to the bathroom, emptying her stomach and she gripped the bowl. \"Quick acting,\" she groaned before her vomit hit its second stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Britney---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney dreamed she was at work, in front of her bosses and clients, unveiling the end of the long campaign. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" she beamed, hands on her enormous belly, \"I am proud to say that with our efforts, we have turned pregnant lingerie into a household word!\"<br>\r\nThe audience, all hugely pregnant like Britney, with all different shapes and sizes, applauded, a few attempting to give a standing ovation and giving up on the effort within seconds of the attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney pulled on a rope and dropped a large curtain, revealing three sample billboards, each with a different pregnant woman, pouting and looking sexily out at the consumer, one hand on their belly, one on their lips. Each had on fancy laced lingerie, one with long, dark stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first step in making sure that pregnancy is not something to be ashamed of, but something beautiful and to be openly embraced!\" Britney said, walking from poster to poster. \"Pregnant is the sexy of the 21st Century! And this new line of lingerie will make that known to the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Britney said, slipping out of her clothes. \"Join me in welcoming my two accomplices, without whom, none of this would have been possible! Sarah Richardson-\" <br>\r\nWith that, Sarah strutted out on stage, gigantic belly bouncing and jiggling as she did, with nothing to conceal her fertile body but bright blue lingerie.<br>\r\n\"-and Diana Larsen!\" <br>\r\nNext was Diana's turn, who walked out proudly, just as big and nearly naked as Sarah, rubbing her belly and waving.<br>\r\n\"And of course, our partnership with Xpect Energy Drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience applauded as one final pregnant woman walked out, with her long brown hair and breathy, professional voice. \"Xpect Energy Drink,\" she said, turning sideways to the audience, jutting out her belly as she drank the can. \"Fills you with life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Britney said, waking up suddenly. \"Ugh...what....what time is it?\" She blinked her eyes before settling back into bed. And just then, her phone's alarm went off, eliciting a very angry groan from Britney. \"At least I don't feel like I need to barf this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the apartment, Sarah was just waking up too, stretching and running her hands down her side, discovering something much larger that it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She moaned and groaned as she dreamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing before a massive auditorium of her massive peers, a massive collection of reporters who were massive, and other massive massive people who made up the massively mass group of masses. Some had hands on their pregnant belly, other had hands in the small of their back, but each and every person was pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked around confused, until she felt a massive THUMP coming from inside herself, her eyes look downing to find that not only was she completely naked in front of everyone, she was also massively pregnant, and she had forgotten to write a speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately tried to cover up her massively pregnant body, but instead found herself, modeling, turning herself sideways,  showing off her massive pregnance, resting her hands in the small of her arched back, jutting her bare belly more forward, making her appear even bigger. She whipped her hair back and forth, making the pregnant scientists appear as a naked sex goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pregnant man and a pregnant woman suddenly materialized in front of her, fading in from nothingness, holding a big large gold medal on a necklace. <br>\r\n\"For your work in your field, which has led to breakthroughs in the field of human reproduction and fertility, and biology, and in addition, leading to gender equality, and world peace, we hereby award you the Medal Of Awesomeness, sponsored by Xpect Energy Drink.\" The two scientists said, draping the medal on Diana's shoulder, her skin getting goosebumps as the cold gold rested squarely across her swollen breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the audience started applauding wildly, Diana looking on with one hand on the gold medal around her neck, another hand rubbing the vast expanse of her naked pregnant belly,  a smile across her face, a tear rolling down her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect!\" The woman from the Xpect commercial appeared again, completely naked just like everyone. \"Fills you with life!\" She drank the drink and Diana watched as she saw every single portion of the naked woman grow massively pregnant. Her breasts swelling, her belly expanding, The woman finished the can, and placed her hands on her belly and began rubbing. Alarm bells began ringing deafeningly in her head as - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana awoken in a jolt, her stomach lurching as she puked into the wastepaper basket by her bed. URK! She emptied the content of her stomach, before carrying the wastecan over to the toilet and emptying the contents into the toliet. She washed her hands in the sink, and nearly screamed when she saw her own reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her phone from off the night-stand, she opened up her voice memo program and began recording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Diana's Log. After accidentally ingesting the can of Xpect during the lab test last night, I was struck with immediate and severe nausea and vomiting. After experiencing a.. troubling dream very similar to my friend Sarah.. I mean to Subject One, I woke up this morning with more nausea and vomiting. More frightening however is...  </i> Diana dictated undressing front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More changes to my body. On Day 2 as I would call it, since the ingestion, as I will call it ING, my breasts have appeared to swollen in size, and my aureolas have started to darken into a slightly darker brown color</i> Diana dictated, as she looked at her changed body in the mirror. Her breasts were indeed bigger, and her nipples have started to darkend. Touching them with her free hand, she felt a wave of sensitive pleasure rush through her body. <i>Touching my new larger breasts have elicited a pleasurable sensation as in fact, my breasts have become extremely sensitive. Matching my symptoms of that to Subject One, I can only begin to believe that whatever side-effects this Xpect drink causes are not on an individual basis. I'm heading into the lab today to take blood-samples and continue my research.</i> Diana finished the dictation, and then began taking pictures of herself with the camera phone for later use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a hot shower, she got dressed and headed straight down to the lab. However, another symptom caught up with her, and she pulled into a burger joint to order the deluxe double breakfast burger, with Morning fries and Orange Juice. Devouring it within minutes, she pulled out her phone and began to once again dictate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>More symptoms similar to that of Subject One have began to manifest themselves. After the bought of nausea and vomiting this working, I found myself craving greasy salty foods this morning on the way to the lab. I pulled over and immediately ordered the deluxe double breakfast, with fries and orange juice. Normally I eat healthy and watch my caloric intake, but something this morning... a craving almost.. wanted me to eat this.. garbage. I'm making a note of this and will have a full report ready sometime soon. I will get in contact with Subject One to see if she has anymore symptoms over the next few days and see if any of them match up to what I might experience. </i> Diana let out a little burp, started up the car again, and headed off to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, she was riding the elevator to the one of the top floors of Trionics, ready to continue the study of the mysterious drink. When the elevator DINGED and the doors slide open, Diana was not ready for what she saw next... The police, lab techs, and everyone else, scurrying back and forth. Pictures were being taken, notes being exchanged, all amongst the worried chatter of the other Trionic employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Diana! There you are! We were wondering when you would show up today. I need all the hard data and list of products you have back-up on your AirDrive.. Now\" The stern faced older technician said. \"What's going on? What's with the police?\" Diana asked, somewhat alarmed. Hard-data dumps from back-ups were not an everyday occurrence. \"We had a break-in last night. Something has been taken because Speciman-Fridge 05 was broken into to, the alarm went off sometime this morning. We're trying to figure out what\" The tech said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana's heart went down to her stomach. She knew it could have been only one thing... She ran past the tech and the police into the lab, looking at the fridge, whose door looked like it had been ripped off the handle. \"Move!\" Diana shouted pushing aside one of the other lab-techs.. Everything was there.. Except for the can of Xpect she left in there the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\" Diana shouted, banging her hands against the fridge. \"What? What is it?\" The lab tech from before asked her. \"Someone took it. Someone took the Xpect!\" She put a hand on the side of her head, feeling a migraine coming on. <br>\r\n\"Xpect? What's Xpect?\" The tech asked. <br>\r\n\"I met up with an old friend yesterday who complained of weird symptoms after drinking this energy drink she got off the internet. I looked over the can and it had nothing on it. No labeling, no information, nothing. I took it back here last night to run tests on it, and got some seriously weird shit. It was like the drink was blacker than midnight, and had nothing it it. No carbonation, no sugar, no nothing. Whatever that.. drink is.. I don't know.\" Diana recapped for her co-worker Thomas, who was the tech from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is it?\" Thomas asked. \"I think someone took it. I had to leave early last night after I got sick because some of the drink spilled in my mouth and - - - \" Diana said, not entirely aware of what she was saying. \"Wait, Diana. Are you saying that you had a Level-Delta 1 incident occur in this lab.. TO YOU.. and didn't tell anyone immediately?\" Thomas asked very serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It was just an energy drink, or so I thought. This break-in, I think someone is trying to cover something up. I've been keeping an audio log because I have similar side effects to my friend\" Diana explained, playing the audio logs for Thomas, minus showing him the naked pictures of herself of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, in the privacy of his office, Thomas asked Diana some serious questions. \"So you think an energy drink is behind all of this?\"<br>\r\n\"Look, let me show the commercial\" Diana said, pulling up the Xpect commercial, but finding the Youtube rip only found the file \"This video has been deleted\" with only the comment section showing. The Xpect website itself was seemingly offline, showing only a picture of a very old pregnant woman showing her bare belly with the words \"Old website is growing into something new! Check back for updates!\" and no other links. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana, are you feeling okay?\" Thomas asked. \"NO I'M NOT! I feel like hot garbage but look at all this shit going on. It wasn't like this yesterday, somebody is trying to cover this up!\" Diana screamed, her rollarcoaster emotions getting the best of her. <br>\r\nThomas came behind her, and rubber her shoulders. \"Look, your my friend, hell, you're like a sister to me. Look, I'm taking you down to the Med Lab for some tests, and then I want you to get some rest\" He said before being interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I want to find out what happened. Somebody is covering up something\" Diana said, determined. \"You're not going to let that go will you?\" <br>\r\n\"No\" Diana said sternly. \"Fine. After I take you down to the Medical Lab, I want you to trace down the IP address of those comments and that website. See if you can find something out, then talk to friend, see how she's doing. I'll send you the video footage when we finish ripping it off the hard-drives. Maybe we caught a look at who did this. The investigation into this is yours Diana. Don't let me down\" Thomas said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it boss\" Diana said, as she was walked down to the medical lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmm~\" Sarah purred before the sunlight and her own roommates' commotion woke her up. She opened her eyes suddenly, realizing what just happened, and blushed brightly. She'd had a sex dream, and a pretty realistic one at that. That was bashful enough on its own, but the thing that sent it over the edge was that Sarah was pregnant in the dream. Immensely so. She'd never dreamt about being pregnant before, at least that she can remember, and now it was in each of Sarah's dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Sarah stepped her legs over the bed's sides and looked down at herself. That was a little hard, as her chest had grown again over the night. Sarah moved her neck around, her new bust too full for her to see over. But once she got a look past the girls, she saw a sight she wished she hadn't. Sarah's increased weight from the other day had grown as well. Sarah now sported a potbelly that didn't even let her see her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...not good,\" Sarah said, putting her hand over her belly. It was tight and a little warm, not like fat at all. When Sarah ran one finger down its curve, she got a little shiver too. Definitely not like fat. \"I might be retaining some water,\" Sarah said, nodding to herself. \"That's it. My body's preparing to shed a bunch of fat and turn it all into energy and protein and...and...\" Sarah ran out of healthy buzzwords and stood up, stretching her arms and abs before slipping into her workout clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was all too aware of her increased size as she slipped into her already-restrictive running top and shorts. Now, her belly and breasts were accentuated by tight, stretched-out fabric. The breasts, she didn't mind as much. If anything, Sarah hoped they wouldn't go away with the rest of her weight. But the belly needed to go. Sarah put her hands over her weight before heading out the door. At least it was localized in one area. Someone might even call it cute. But it was a bad look for a fitness instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah ran, the increased weight made a noticeable difference. She got tired more easily and her ankles felt like they were swelling, which made each step tricky. Her normal outing would take Sarah up lots of hills and stairs, but instead, Sarah changed her course for the city park. A nice, even landscape, with plenty of pretty flowers and trees. And this early in the day, there wasn't too much foot traffic so no one would see the new \"plus-sized\" Sarah Richardson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be so much easier to say that Sarah had been an awkward, quiet girl growing up who was on the heavy side, and then when she hit puberty, started to blossom into the athletic beauty she is today, but that just wasn't the case. Sarah had always loved to exercise and was always gorgeous. So the appearance of a potbelly was a bit of a new undertaking for Sarah and she hoped she wouldn't have to get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne other thing Sarah was having trouble adjusting to was her new cup size. She was a pretty well-endowed woman before Xpect, but now, with her current breasts, running was much different. Her previous sports bra was proving ineffective and the weight of her chest bouncing around as she ran took its toll as well. If it didn't hurt so much, Sarah would laugh over it. But it did hurt that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made it to the park's water fountains, Sarah slowed down and took some deep breaths, hands on her now-widened hips. Feeling hot, Sarah unzipped the front of her outfit, fanning her sweaty cleavage. The occasional passersby (many more than Sarah had hoped) gave this scene an interested grin, which Sarah responded to based on the giver's attractiveness. Sarah took some final big sips from the fountain, inadvertently giving park-goers a look at her behind, which had grown full and tight in conjunction with her belly and breasts. With that, she headed back to her apartment, surprisingly feeling better and less exhausted on the return trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah jogged up the steps to her apartment, just catching David and Trisha as they came out of their unit. \"Hi David, hi Trisha!\" Sarah beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah,\" Trisha said. \"Just finished your run, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Sarah beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been thinking of joining MegaGym, actually,\" David said. \"As you can see, I've been putting on a little...well.\" David looked down at his stomach, which was indeed bigger than the last time Sarah saw him. Trisha's too, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it might be sympathy weight,\" Trisha said, looking up at her husband with a little worried smile. \"We're actually going to the doctor's now. I've been feeling a little funny the past few days and the last time I felt like this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha was cut off by Laci and Maci poking their heads out the door. \"What's taking so long? Aren't you gone yet?\" Maci whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what are you planning on doing when we're away?\" Trisha asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" the two said in unison. Sarah noticed that both looked a little...bosomier than usual, although only Maci really showed it off. Shaking her head, she turned head back to the Hamiltons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think you'd both love it at MegaGym!\" Sarah said excitedly. \"Would Laci and Maci join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not,\" Trisha said. \"Everyone needs exercise and those two don't get too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" David said, his eyes on Sarah's chest. In fact, his eyes had been glued there the entire conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess that confirms whether they got bigger or not</i>, Sarah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.\" Trisha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" He blinked, and looked over at his wife, who looked back at him with a cold intensity. \"Oh, yeah, we'll all sign up at the gym. I guess we'll see you there...tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No better time to start than now!\" Sarah smiled. \"Well, good luck at your check-up, you two. Bye!\" Sarah turned and went back into her own apartment, undressing and taking a quick, wet cloth clean-up to feel a little fresher before she taught her classes. On the way out, Sarah ran into all of her neighbors, all conveniently leaving at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Sarah, what splendid timing!\" Sabrina said in her thespian flourish. \"I was just on my way to MegaGym now. Perhaps you would like to share a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MegaGym? You?\" Sarah said with surprise. Sabrina had never seemed like the type to work out. Every time Sarah went by her apartment, she was rehearsing lines in a sweeping, dramatic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, I realize that I've ignored the possibility of the action genre in my roles, as well as the myriad of classical medieval stories for women. So, I was hoping to improve my flexibility and muscle build,\" Sabrina said, gesticulating with each word. Sarah looked down and saw the real cause for Sabrina wanting to go to the gym. Just like Sarah and the Hamiltons, she'd gotten fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...okay! I'm always happy to have more people at the gym! And I think you'll like it!\" Luckily for Sabrina, Sarah was cynicism-proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, i-if you're driving together, may I join you?\" Ms. Perkins said quietly. \"I feel like I should be getting more exercise as well. My sister, she's even older than I am, but she's been running and why she looks so nice now. Like Shirley MacLaine! Why, I remember when we were girls, every Friday, we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ms. Perkins, what a fa~scinating story!\" Sabrina said. \"You'll have to tell it to me some time when we have dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we never have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Perkins,\" Sarah said, chipper in the face of Sabrina's obviously awkward attempt to ignore their elderly neighbor, \"of course you may drive with us. I think it's great that you're getting exercise. There are plenty of women your age at MegaGym!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked down to Sarah's car, as the Smiths got into their adjacent car. \"Hello Sarah!\" Tami said with a wave. \"Off to the gym? Andrew and I were just heading over! We're thinking of taking a couples exercise course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! See you there!\" Sarah beamed, turning on the car and driving off. Wow, so many new people at the gym, a new partnership that Sarah started. Things were going Sarah's way lately! Belly be damned, nothing could ruin Sarah's mood! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah walked into MegaGym, bending over and groaning as she got her I.D. card out of her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having some trouble, Sarah?\" Rebecca's faux syrupy voice said from behind the counter. Sarah didn't have to look up to see her friendly rival to know she was grinning at her. Of course, Sarah couldn't exactly look up. At least not with the speed she was accustomed to. As she tried to bend back, Sarah put her hand on her now-puffy belly and heaved herself up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird, I seem to be touching my stomach a lot lately</i>, Sarah thought to herself, standing up and looking at Rebecca, flashing a smile back. \"I'm fine, Rebecca. Maybe a little sore from my run. I haven't seen you out there in a while, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca pursed her lips, her eyes flashing back. \"Well, I've been busy with my <b>boyfriend</b>, you know. And we work out together plenty of times.\" There it was. The barb Rebecca loved to use on Sarah. The boyfriend. Ever since Sarah knew Rebecca, she had been utterly, devastatingly single. In truth, Sarah had been in a long-term relationship right before working at MegaGym. The break-up is what set that all off. Sure, Sarah had been a fitness and health nut before, but the end just...made something in her snap. Sarah's cheery, dopey personality took a 180 and her usual workouts turned into multiple-hour long runs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana might have made a remark about Sarah trying to run away from her problems, but Sarah couldn't remember. Her obsession with exercise eventually found itself at MegaGym, where a career and a structure to her routine plateaued Sarah's seeming mania and brought her back to the cheery protagonist we all know and love now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sweet,\" Sarah replied, smiling back. As she checked in, Sarah peered over the desk, noticing Rebecca's wide open shirt, her own impressive cleavage on display. In fact, Rebecca's breasts were quite a bit larger than Sarah remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Sarah's own newly-ample chest was resting on the counter. Rebecca looked up herself and grinned. \"New brassiere, Sarah? A push-up, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked down and rolled her eyes. \"Oh, that. I guess I'm just not done growing. Or maybe it's this Xpect energy drink. I told you it does amazing things for the body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need more, then,\" Rebecca laughed softly, motioning at Sarah's belly. Sarah pulled her shirt down to straighten it out, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-it's a side effect, I'm sure. It'll go away eventually,\" Sarah squeaked, picking her bag back up. \"Well...see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later~\" Rebecca smiled, returning to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah set up her things for Femme-Fit, taking a long sip of water, feeling her joints before her class came in. And when they did, Sarah was in for a bit of a surprise and a relief. The women all looked...bigger. Upstairs and down. At least they looked like they were having the same effects as Sarah had from the Xpect, which calmed Sarah down. No one looked as big as her, though. That was a bit of a disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...everyone ready?\" Sarah said with a beaming smile. No surprise, the rest of the women looked a little concerned. \"Look, I noticed the extra weight too, but don't worry! It's water weight the nutrients in the Xpect are helping us develop so we can shed a lot of toxins and fat at once! We'll all feel great afterward!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to encourage some of the women, but not all of them. A few put their hands on their midsections cautiously before looking back at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay? Okay! Let's go!\" Sarah said, putting on the music and starting the session, starting with some jogging in place. It was much more difficult than it was two days ago, and not just because Sarah went running a few hours ago. The weight was still limiting her and it was clearly limiting the other women as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, is it okay if you...I dunno, slow down a little?\" Peggy, a 36-year-old divorcee asked. She had curly brown hair and bright lipstick she always wore every session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, come on everyone! We need to push the hardest when we feel the worst! It's your body creating a mental wall! Now, come on, let's do some real aerobics!\" Sarah switched to an even peppier song and started moving around with much more excitement, which only made her chest shake more and hurt Sarah a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look too good either, Sarah,\" Theresa said, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine! I just...need some new clothes. When we have our next session, I'll be much better,\" Sarah said. \"And besides, this is perfect! See, I'm having trouble just like all of you. I'm in here with you! We can help each other! Work! Effort! Believe! Now stretch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Femme-Fit class went on for its usual length, Sarah's new breasts shimmering with sweat at the end. The other women were bent over, hands on their knees, panting heavily. \"Good job everyone!\" Sarah said. \"Same time in two days! And go home and be proud of how empowered you feel!\" As Sarah took another gulp of water, one of the younger members, Megan, came up to her. Megan was in her mid 20s, married, with short black hair and an adorable chipmunk face. \"Hi Megan! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Sarah,\" Megan said nervously. \"I was just wondering...is it possible to take two different classes as MegaGym at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! There are people in this class who take swimming and yoga and all sorts of things too. Why, what were you thinking of taking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan paused. \"Nina's pregnant maternity class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's jaw dropped and she squealed, hugging Megan tightly. \"Ohmigod! Megan! Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gave a little smile and reluctantly hugged Sarah back. \"Thanks. It, um, wasn't exactly expected or...or planned, but we're both willing to see it through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let go and kept smiling. \"Well, Nina will be happy to have someone new in her class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there were some more people signed up when I joined,\" Megan said. \"I just she had some more luck since you talked to her.\" They both shrugged and Sarah showered her friend with some more unnecessary joy before going off to see her co-workers some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakroom was nowhere near as happy as it was two days ago. \"Sarah, what was in those drinks you gave us?\" Jim complained. \"I've bloated so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no fat, right?\" Sarah said, pointing at him with a grin. \"It's just water weight until-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, seriously, you take so much crap,\" Terry said, rubbing his temples. \"I wasn't able to lift nearly as much today. I'll need to do so much core work to get rid of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...it's...and it'll turn into energy,\" Sarah said, feeling herself wilting. Emily walked in from her office, her chest and belly bigger just like the other women Sarah encountered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, a word please,\" Emily said beckoning Sarah inside her office. \"Sarah...I'm having doubts about this Xpect stuff. I've put on weight, I've been having weird dreams, I...are you sure about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm so sure!\" Sarah said, standing up straight, her eyes getting big. \"Look, the weight is just water weight, the dreams are for better REM rest, and we both look hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shrugged. \"I...there's a few benefits, I suppose. It's fuller, shinier...\" Emily looked over at Sarah, who was on the verge of a grin. \"My hair, I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sarah nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'll see how I feel tomorrow, then I'll let you know,\" Emily said. \"That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah left the breakroom quickly, knowing she wouldn't have as easy a time with Lori, Terry, and Jim as she did with Emily. As she headed out, she ran into Nina. Almost literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina...\" Sarah said, looking at her friend. \"You look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Nina said, putting her hands on her belly. It wasn't hard. Nina's belly had grown at least half a foot since Sarah last saw her. \"I...I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. This might just be what happens near the end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Sarah said, putting a hand on Nina's belly. It was tight and warm. A familiar feeling Sarah couldn't quite put her finger on. \"You still look good pregnant, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Nina said, rolling her eyes. \"Still no stretch marks, so that's a plus...do you want to hang out later tonight? I want to get my mind off this and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Sarah said, with such joy and energy that Nina had to cover her ears. \"I'll text you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Nina laughed. \"Get Diana and Britney too. I haven't seen them in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Sarah smiled, attempting to hug her quite-pregnant friend. \"Bye!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah made her way into MegaGym's locker room, deciding to shower and change there so she could get a jump on the day's tasks more quickly. As she made her way into the shower, looking for a free stall, she saw that the room was full of mostly members of her Femme-Fit class. \"Oh, hi Sarah,\" Peggy said, just as she was undoing her bra. \"We don't usually see you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled and shrugged. \"It just made sense to shower and change here today. Why, do you all gossip and say rude things about your teacher when I'm not around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy laughed as well, stepping into the available stall and hanging her bra on the dividing wall. \"No, not at all. Just an observation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah got into the stall next to hers and turned on the water, letting her body adjust to the cool temperature before rubbing it all over her sweaty skin. \"Well, it'll be nice to talk to all of you. I rarely get a chance to chat with you ladies.\" The dividing walls only went up to their shoulders, so Sarah and Peggy could still see each other perfectly well. \"How are you doing, Peggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good,\" Peggy said, nodding. \"Other than the nausea I had a few days ago and this bloating, I think I feel pretty good. And,\" Peggy added with a coy grin. \"I'm seeing someone new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peggy, that's great!\" Sarah exclaimed, running soap over her body, getting plenty between her new, deepened cleavage, \"you know, you look great since working out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're right,\" Peggy nodded. \"When I looked at myself in the mirror this morning, I felt...different. Like I had more energy, like my curves were sexier, like I had more confidence. Thank you for that, Sarah. For a woman approaching 40, that's really something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you did plenty of that yourself. And it's like I tell all of you: age is only a number,\" Sarah said. \"So, tell me about this guy! What's he like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He owns a restaurant,\" Peggy said, blushing slightly. \"And he's taking me out for dinner tonight. None too soon, I might add. I've been feeling so hungry lately. And for such weird foods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"Same for me. It's your body preparing to take in more energy because of the Xpect drink.\" Sarah looked down as she washed some of the soap off. She noticed her breasts had red marks from her now-too-small-bra was pressing into her growing chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird cravings? That's something I know about now,\" Megan laughed, stepping into the next stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling people now? Can you tell Peggy?\" Sarah said on the verge of squealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled and nodded. \"Sure. I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, congratulations,\" Peggy said with a big smile. \"I'm so happy for you. You and your husband are such a wonderful couple.\" Peggy sighed and started washing shampoo out of her hair. \"Kevin and I never had any kids. That's probably for the best, the way we turned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see you in my class, trying to jump and stretch with a big belly,\" Sarah giggled, looking over at Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Megan laughed much less enthusiastically. \"Hopefully Nina's maternity class is a little more...suited to the pregnant body than yours. No offense, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Sarah nodded proudly. \"I try and push all of you ladies. Including myself. It's important to be strong and fit, physically, mentally, and emotionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll need something to take my mind off the little aches and pains of pregnancy, I suppose,\" Megan smiled. \"My breasts are already sore, I feel bloated and I had that awful nausea a few days ago. Sarah, you're only a year or two younger than me. Trust me: wait a few years before having a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Sarah joked quietly, the vague memories of her past relationship and talks about having a baby someday flashed painfully in her mind. \"Well, I'll see you both soon. Until then, make sure you stretch before you go to sleep and when you wake up. It's a great, quick, painless way to stay fit and limber during the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked over to her locker, breasts on display, as she got out her non-athletic clothing. If the red marks taught Sarah anything, it's that it's best to forego a bra until she gets one that fits properly. Anything else might result in permanent tissue damage. As Sarah slipped her shirt on and straightened it out to make sure her nipples wouldn't show, Theresa walked by the row of lockers. She stopped and waved to Sarah and walked on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Theresa,\" Sarah smiled. \"I'm getting to meet all of my students lately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's nice to see you,\" Theresa nodded. \"I wanted to ask you...is ankle swelling a symptom of working out improperly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her lip up, thinking. \"Possibly, but I shouldn't have given you any exercises that would do much to your ankles. I would maybe get that looked at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing painful. I was just curious,\" Theresa smiled. She was always careful to not cause any trouble, even if it was something simple. It made Sarah a little sad. She was glad she could at least get Theresa to keep healthy through classes at MegaGym, or else she might wither away and not tell anyone for fear of bothering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid to see a physical therapist or a doctor,\" Sarah said, pulling up her pants. \"Although, to tell you the truth, my ankles have felt a little puffy as well. Maybe I should change up the next routines a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa nodded. \"And I'm also...feeling very hungry lately. Is that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just part of the Xpect,\" Sarah said with a smile to reassure her student. \"Don't worry, I've noticed it too. Totally fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good I suppose,\" Theresa said quietly nodding. \"Good to talk to you, Sarah. You sure this bloating will go away soon too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Sarah said, her chest swelling as she took in a regal breath. \"I have the upmost confidence in Xpect.\"</span></div></div>",

She was relieved to find that in the current formula the effects don't stack but the damage will be done. But she also saw that apparently this formula makes it so you can't do an abortion or have a C-SECTION because it apparently has the placenta pretty much around the entire uterus and trying will kill the one who drank the formula because it somehow makes the brain and heart to shut down immediately if this happens. Apparently the only way for it to have no effect on the body is if the person had their reproductive organs removed in which case the formula will be just a typical energy drink.

He was a tall, tanned, handsome guy, with super short brown hair, a tight beard, and a competitive athlete's body. Darren modeled men's underwear for photo shoots before coming to Soft Lace, the lingerie store they both worked at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Britney said with a smile, getting up from her desk. \"Just bumped into the desk. And honestly, I'm pretty stressed for the show tomorrow. We didn't have nearly enough time with these new models or setting up the order or even finished deciding which outfits we're wearing. Plus, I feel sore and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine,\" Darren grinned, walking with Britney to the dressing rooms in the back. Soft Lace had expanded wildly in the past few years, adding on a full runaway for fashion shows for the various lingerie they would unveil. Britney got the rare role of being a model and a director of some of these shows. Darren was a great professional too and had a real knack for organization and promotion. And, because he was gay, he could be more hands-on with the models without them feeling uncomfortable. \"Here, we're about to do a run-through, so get changed quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already got it on under all this,\" Britney said, wiggling her eyebrows smartly as she got out of her work clothes to reveal the black lingerie she had on. It actually felt like a relief getting her shows and blouse off. Her swelling had made everything much tighter than she remembered. Even if it was a little embarrassing to go out in her lingerie with her water weight showing, it physically felt better than going out in a conservative business suit. \"I guess you can see part of the reason that I'm a little stressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren mulled it in his head, looking at the slight belly Britney rubbed with her fingertips. \"It doesn't look so bad. Someone might even think it's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney rolled her eyes and walked out to the runway with Darren, complaining slightly with each step. \"I think I need a new bra too. Everything's been feeling so damn tight lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the girls said,\" Darren said, slipping out of his brown coat and swiping through his phone. \"Let's see, what were their names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awful with names,\" Britney said with another eye roll and a laugh. \"Isn't that why your last date threw his glass in your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less about me and more about this show,\" Darren grumbled. \"I whipped these newbies into shape a little while you were gone yesterday. I think we'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone could do it, you can,\" Britney said, stepping out of the dressing area and on stage. There was a line of four girls waiting, each in a different pair of lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They got a little tired, but you left behind some energy drinks in your bag the day before last, so I had them take those home. You know, get some muscle memory out of it. Let's see if it helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sarah must have snuck some of that garbage into my bag that day</i>, Britney thought as she looked over the models with Darren. They all looked a little...different than she remembered. A little curvier and bustier. <i>Well, nothing wrong with that</i>, she thought, getting out her own list for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...Monica, Gisele, Nico, Michelle,\" Darren said, looking from his phone to the models after each name. \"We're going to do a mock run right now and we'll brainstorm after. Britney will be able to help you a little bit backstage, but tomorrow, she'll probably barely be available. Now, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd go they did. All five models went backstage and Darren hit the music, watching carefully and taking notes as each girl came out, did her walk, then went backstage to change into another outfit and go out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was a mid-height girl with tan skin and a face peppered with freckles. Her runway expression was constantly piercing like a movie star's and she had an adorable short haircut. Most of her outfits were teddies, giving off a more luxurious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele was a short Latina girl with shining dark hair tied in a long, braided ponytail. Her outfits focused on accentuating her bust that was already very impressive before drinking Xpect. Her runway expression was always warm and inviting, but Darren thought she could reel it in a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico was a strikingly tall pale girl with long, feathery blond hair. Her face was always vacant and weirdly alluring and her outfits usually consisted of some sort of stocking or attachment to her thigh. Nico also always went out on the walkway in long, white heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle was a black girl with a shaved head and a mature, elegant gaze. When Britney first met her, she had tight abs, but something must have happened in the last day or so that gave her a slight paunch (come to think of it, the other girls had this too...). Michelle's lingerie was also a bit lacier than everyone else's, giving off an almost other-worldly look to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Britney's amazement, they all got through the trial run remarkably well, and even Darren seemed to be nodding along pleasantly. \"That was pretty great,\" Darren said when the six all got together. \"Why don't you all take a little break and I'm going to check something with the boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone let out a moan and a sigh as they sat down on the runway. \"Ugh, I feel so sore,\" Britney moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Gisele said. \"Nico, I don't know how you can keep those heels on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little tighter than usual but I guess I've just built up a resistance,\" Nico shrugged with a smile. \"Michelle, don't you get sore working out all the time and doing this at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle smiled brightly. \"Honestly, working out and going over to MegaGym makes my whole body loosen up after a day of modeling. But you're right, I have been feeling a little off today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was looking at her phone, not saying anything. Britney looked over, wondering what she might be up to, when her own phone rang. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney?\" a quiet, monotone voice said. \"It's Laci. Can you come over to the apartment? It's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An emergency? You can't...call your parents?\" Britney said, a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't contact many people. It's not something we can go to many people about. We figured someone younger would be cooler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about Sarah, did you try her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah feels like a ray of sunshine,\" Laci said in a colder, still monotone voice. \"And I don't go out in the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Britney said, \"just hold on.\" She put her phone away and got up, heading for the dressing room. \"Tell Darren I went out for an emergency. I'll call him when I'm heading back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney sped back to the apartment, gripping the steering wheel. What kind of problem could they have gotten into that they couldn't tell their parents? Maybe it was drugs or alcohol? Or if it's something involving Laci, maybe some sort of weird...cult thing or magic thing? She didn't really know what Laci was into. Maybe Maci was the one in trouble. She got some boyfriend over and something went bad. He took a black market Viagra and had a heart attack. Britney shook her head frantically. What was she thinking? All of these were terrible guesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Britney parked, she ran up to Laci and Maci's apartment and knocked on the door frantically. The door opened and Laci and Maci were standing at the door, looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Britney said, gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need you to buy us a pregnancy test,\" they said in unison.</span></div></div>",

WHY? Do you need one?\" Britney asking a stupid question that she knew the answer to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?\" Laci said, itching her nose, one of several black nose rings getting in the way. <br>\r\nIt should have been obvious. <br>\r\n'\"I think we should just show her Laci\" Maci said, her hands going to the hemline of her shirt. <br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do\" Laci said with a smile forming on the corners of her white painted face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci and Maci lifted up their shirts to reveal a very small but prominent bulge. Laci's shirt was a very tight black shirt with some kind of horrible monster on it with the word \"DEATH\" written in red. Maci's shirt was a light blue short-sleeve shirt with a smiley face on it. Laci with a devilish smile, turned to her side showing off her profile, which made it very obvious that the goth was knocked up a notch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexy isn't it?\" Laci said, raising an pierced eyebrow. \"Laci, quiet\" Maci said quietly, almost ashamed of what was happening to her. <br>\r\nBritney took a moment, just staring at the bellies of the two twins, trying to find the right words. <br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Britney asked, a poor first question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci and Maci pulled back down their shirts over their bellies, trying to find the kind of putting it. <br>\r\n\"Well - - - \" Maci said thinking, but Laci finished her thought. <br>\r\n\"Cause you're not a freaking narc.\" Laci said bluntly. <br>\r\n\"Laci! Don't put it like that!\" Maci snapped at her twin sister. <br>\r\n\"If I waited for you to find the right way to put it, we'd be giving birth by then\" Laci snapped back at her sister. <br>\r\n\"I just don't know what to do\" Maci said, obviously lost in a daze of what was happening to her. <br>\r\n\"That's why I called. I think we're pregnant. Don't know how - - - \" Laci said, before being interrupted. <br>\r\n\"You don't know how.. I'm pretty sure I know how\" Britney said back sternly, almost assuming a motherly tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't talk crap like that. We're not sluts. We didn't plan on getting pregnant in college. Look, I don't know how to tell you this but Maci is in a bit of a \"dry\" spell\" Laci said, much to Maci's embarrassment and Britney's surprise. Maci was a very smart, VERY pretty girl, and for her to be \"on her own\" for more than while surprised her. <br>\r\n\"And as for me\" Laci said, wrapping her hands around the decent sized bulge in her midsection \"Let's just say.. men are not my cup of tea\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. then how are you so sure that you're\u2026\" Britney asked. <br>\r\n\"We're sure\" Maci said quietly. <br>\r\n\"How can we not be?\" Laci said, lifting back up her shirt and showing her bulge again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck Britney that this was the most she's ever talked to Laci and Maci\u2026 ever. They were always quiet, to themselves, and talking in unison. They were always \"the strange twins\" next door. Now, before her, we're two young women with a problem on their hands, and more importantly, in their belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't go get a pregnancy test from the supermarket. Our parents shop there. Someone will recognize us and it's game over, plus we don't have a car right now. Sabrina is a total - - \" Laci started to say before being cut off by Maci \"No the right person, and we barely even know the Smiths.\" <br>\r\n\"What about Ms. Perkins?\" Britney asked, trying to deflect herself out of this situation. <br>\r\n\"Pfft. She'd call our parents the second we told her why. Plus she's old-fashioned. I do not need to hear about how this didn't happen \"In the old days\" Laci said, adding a slight bit of mockery to  Ms. Perkins, by pretending to be holding a cane and talking in a stereotypical old person voice. <br>\r\n\"You're our only option. If we're not pregnant and it's just bloating\" Maci said, hopeful.<br>\r\n\"Which it's not\" Laci corrected, dashing all of Maci's hope all goth metal like. <br>\r\n\"Then all the better. But if we are, you can help us\" Maci finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Britney asked. <br>\r\n\"By taking us to the mall to buy baby stuff, taking us to doctor's appointments, taking my pregnancy pictures, all the fun stuff\" Laci said, with a fiendish smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" Britney questioned not aware of the trap about to be sprung on her. <br>\r\n\"Because if you don't, we'll tell our parents that you bought us pregnancy tests without telling them, and they will be super super pissed.\" Laci sprung the trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck Britney hard. She was caught. This wasn't a request, it was blackmail. <br>\r\n\"You little shits\" Britney said realizing \"You're blackmailing me\" <br>\r\n\"It's was Laci's idea\" Maci said quietly. <br>\r\n\"To be fair, it was you or Sarah, and like I said, Sarah's sunbeam personality burns my black-as-coal metal soul\" Laci said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But if you ARE pregnant, you'll tell your parents immediately.\" Britney said. <br>\r\n\"They would find out sooner or later\" Laci said. <br>\r\nNow that Britney was having a real conversation with Laci, she made the shocking truth that she was kind of a bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be back soon. Don't do anything stupid\" Britney said, grabbing her keys to go get the tests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney left the possible mothers-to-be back in the apartment and got in her car and drove to the supermarket. She walked into the busy supermarket as stealthily as she could, hoping no-one would recognize her. She didn't come her regularly, as Britney and Sarah got their food from an organic whole food store a little bit away, but still, she couldn't take any chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards the built-in pharmacy, she looked over the dozens and dozens of different pregnancy tests on the shelf. Some said quick responding, other said, 100% accurate. Some were digital, others were the old style \"-\" or \"+\". One was even Wi-Fi enabled that would instantly posts the results to social media sites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney thought about how the twins looked. They looked pregnant\u2026 kind of how how Britney looked with the bulge in her middle. But no.. She hadn't in a while.. and even then she used protection. She couldn't be\u2026 But thinking about it.. Where the symptoms of that energy drink something else entirely? Could she? Britney looked down at the small bulge attached to her midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be\" Britney said lost in thought, tempting to put a third pregnancy test on the shopping list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney! Is that you! Imagine the odds!\" Ms Perkins voice could be heard coming closer to her. \"What are you doing here? I thought you and Sarah shopped at that health food place\" She was getting closer, and if Ms. Perkins saw her holding a pregnancy test, questions would follow. Questions she didn't have answers to. <br>\r\nWithout thinking, she started grabbing products off the shelf and putting them in her basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Ms. Perkins\" Britney said with a fake smile. Ms. Perkins looked differently than the last time she saw her. Her grey hair was softer, her skin giving off a healthy glow, her bags appearing firmer and bigger. Looking over Ms. Perkins, she noticed that Ms. Perkins had a noticeable bulge in her midsection, that was visible through the black polka-a-dot dress she was wearing, that just happened to be showing off Ms. Perkins new cleavage, which was impressive, even if slightly wrinkly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Perkin's cart was unusual as it was overflowing. Ms. Perkins only shopped for a few things at time, usually never having much in her fridge the one or two times her and Sarah had been over there, always just having \"enough for herself\". Not today though;  ice cream, pickles, peanut butter, cookies, bizarre looking fruits, you name it. \"I was just getting some uh\" Britney took a look in her basket that she filled up in a desperate attempt to cover her tracks. Foot powder, anti-fungal cream, stool softeners, band-aids. \"Stuff that I needed because I uh have.. bad foot fungus that's uh.. giving me sores and uh\" Britney lied, when the truth probably would have been less embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear\" Ms Perkins said. Britney took a look at the cart. \"Are you having a party or something? You never buy that much food\" Britney asked. \"Oh it's so embarrassing. I've been so hungry lately, and I've had the strangest cravings lately. This morning I wanted pizza, ice cream, and apples all at the same time. Isn't that crazy? I guess that explains this little weight gain I've been experiencing \" Ms. Perkins said, poking the bulge in her middle. \"Luckly, I' live next to two exercise freaks. I'll be joining the gym soon, try to work off this tiny belly. Can't be old and fat you know, not like my other sister \" Ms. Perkins was going on another one of her long stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney was asked something, but she wasn't paying attention, trying to complete \"the mission\" she was sent on. \"Yeah fine whatever\" Britney finally said. <br>\r\n\"Great, you and Britney can come by my place tomorrow night for dinner then!\" Ms. Perkins smiled, hugging Britney (their bulges touching slightly) before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Britney said away from the ears of Ms. Perkins, throwing four pregnancy tests into the basket\u2026 Just in case. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maci was pacing around the apartment nervously as Laci sat across from her, grinning and rubbing her bump. \"Worried, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci flashed her smiling sister a piercing look. \"Knock if off, Laci. I don't know why the idea of being pregnant has got you so happy, but I'm in no rush to be a parent. Mom and Dad are going to kill us.\" Maci hesitantly touched her own bulge. \"Aren't you even concerned about <u>how</u> we got pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci shrugged. \"Who knows? I can come up with a bunch of occult reasons if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Maci shouted as Britney came back into the apartment, two pregnancy tests in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay in here?\" Britney said with a raised eyebrow, looking between the twins. Maci nodded and took one of the tests, heading for the bathroom. Laci smiled and got up, taking the other test and opening it, studying the strip in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a formality at this point,\" Laci said, not even looking at Britney. \"I'm pregnant. I can feel it. I can feel growing inside my womb.\" Laci moved one hand up and down her waist slowly, her smile growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's not jump to conclusions,\" Britney said. \"After all, you said it yourself. You don't exactly get...intimate with men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci turned to Britney, staring at her from behind her glittering violet eyes. \"I had morning sickness the past few days, my belly is sloping out, I've had cravings, my breasts have gotten bigger, and my hair's even gotten shinier. Trust me, I do all I can to make my hair as un-shiny as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's the final straw</i>? Britney thought, looking Laci over. She wanted to tell the goth teen that those were just side effects of the Xpect Sarah handed out all over the floor but...just hearing those symptoms by themselves, it was hard not to come to the conclusion of pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci walked back into the living room, test in hand. \"Bathroom's free,\" she said quietly, shaking the strip as Laci walked with more glee than she'd likely ever had. Maci sat down, head in hand, staring at the end of the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney bit her lip, not sure what to say. Talking and connecting with other people was not her strong suit. That was definitely a \"Sarah\" skill. Still, this poor girl was likely about to find out that she was pregnant and she didn't even have the fun that results in that sort of thing. She had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney sat down beside Maci and looked at her with a little smile. \"I'm sure if you tell your parents, they'll be sympathetic. They're still your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci nodded and sighed. \"I know, I know. And it's not like I had unprotected sex that would cause this sort of thing, so there's only so mad they can get at me, right?\" Maci kept shaking the test, her face getting increasingly pale. \"But, that's not the real problem. Being pregnant in college. Having a huge belly and aches and pains. Giving birth. Deciding whether to give the kid up for adoption. Whether I should even see this thing through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney reached over and put her hand on Maci's arm. \"It'll be okay.\" Of course, Britney couldn't mean that too much. After all, the same worries that Maci was voicing were shared by Britney as she considered the idea that she was also...pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were interrupted by Laci eagerly slamming the bathroom door and holding her pregnancy test with a big smile. \"Alright! The moment of truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci hung her head as Laci sat down across from her sister, watching the test. All three sat in silence until the end of the strips both developed. Pink pluses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci let out a deep sigh as Laci jumped up. \"Fuck yeah! I'm knocked up!\" She started to shake with excitement, running her hands over her stomach with even more vigor than before. \"I can't believe this is really happening!\" As Laci's eyes went back and forth, thinking over all the possibilities she had in store, she hurried into her room and brought back her iPod with a pair of hefty headphones attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci took off her shirt, her full breasts jiggling slightly in the leather bikini she wore instead of a bra, and put the headphones over her belly, hitting play and sitting back with a smile. Even from across the room, Britney and Maci could hear the aggressive music being played. \"What's that?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy Kills Best. An all-pregnant black metal band,\" Laci said. \"Figure I should expose the little seed to some of the right influences. Never too early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci kept shaking her head, looking at her test in dismay. \"What if we're pregnant with twins too?\" Maci moaned. \"Dad's brothers are twins. It probably runs in the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci grinned. \"I hoping for a lot more than twins, Maci. I want to get fucking huge. Lilith from Mommy Kills Best is eight months pregnant with triplets! Can you even imagine?\" Maci shuddered at the idea of getting that pregnant, a feeling Britney shared in. \"Mmm, but it'll be hard to come up with that many names. All I've got so far is Damian or Adrian for a boy and Rosemary or Samara for a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci, don't you think you're getting a little too naive about all this?\" Britney said. \"It's fine if you like the idea of being pregnant, but supporting a child is a big responsibility. And you've still got college think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci rolled her eyes. \"I can take classes online, Britney. Trust me, I'm not the only one at our college who's gotten knocked up. And I've already got a job. I've only been at it about a month and I've already made five grand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Britney said, surprised. She couldn't think of many places that would hire a weird college student where she could make that kind of money. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci pursed her lips and grinned knowingly. \"Oh...computer stuff.\" She reached down and checked the time on her phone. \"Well, I'd better go try and catch the bus. Now that I know there's a little monster growing in here, I'd better get some cribs, stuffed ghouls, things like that. Plus, I need some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your weird goth stuff is already plenty baggy,\" Maci said. \"It's like witches' robes and capes and that sort of nonsense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, that's why I need new clothes,\" Laci smiled. \"I need something super tight to show off this pregnant figure of mine. Hell, I'd just wear a half-shirt that shows off my bare belly, but I don't want to risk getting a tan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Laci took of her headphones and slipped back into her shirt and headed out the door. Britney looked over at Maci, still visibly shaken, and winced. \"So...are you...okay for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Maci grumbled, running one hand through her hair. \"I've just got to figure out what I'm going to tell my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can call me whenever you want,\" Britney said, wishing that Maci wouldn't take her up on that offer. \"I've got to get back to work.\" Britney paused before heading out the door. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Soft Lace, Britney hurried back into the runway room, where the four models and Darren were going over some more notes. \"Sorry, emergency at my apartment,\" Britney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Darren said. \"We did another run-through while you were gone and it went pretty well. We were just going over the order for tomorrow, but I think it's all set. All that's left is for you and I to finalize the guest list and see what other press we can get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, great,\" Britney nodded. \"This might work out after all.\" She turned to the models and smiled. \"You all seem to have a real knack for this. Thanks so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele, Nico, and Michelle all smiled and nodded, thanking Britney as they got up to go change out of their lingerie. Monica gave a weaker smile and left with them, still not saying much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what's up with that one girl?\" Britney asked Darren as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that she just got off of a bad break-up, but I'm not totally sure,\" Darren said, looking at the notes on his phone. \"She does her work well, so I'm not too concerned. Besides, a pretty girl like Monica shouldn't have too much trouble getting into a new relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Britney said sadly. \"Hey, do you have seats for my two friends tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry. The fitness freak and the scientist, right?\" Darren said with a grin. \"These events always have such weird groups of people who show up.\"</span></div></div>",

She scratched the bandage that covered the spot where they took her blood under the thick bright-white pajamas she was forced into. Damn the book, no matter how much she lived by it. Sterile environment, bright all white two-piece pajamas, blood tests, showers, everything and anything went with a possible contamination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and laid back down on the bed in the all-white room. She stared up at the all-white ceiling with it's bright uncovered white lights staring back at her. She lifted up the hemline of her pajama top and slowly explored the firm bulge attached to her midsection. Unless she was going crazy, she could have sworn it was larger than earlier this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning. Was it still morning? In the quarantine, time lost all meaning. No clocks, no windows, no nothing. Just an all-white room with a bed, a white table, and a toilet and shower. Nothing else. Diana tried to keep track of the time in her head, but between all the blood tests and physical examinations, showers, more examinations, more blood-work, and everything else that came \"out of the book\", she had no idea what time or even what day it was. It could have been a hour, it could have been a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and continued to feel the warm firm bump that was her stomach, and talked to herself. \"What are you? Where did you come from?\" She asked it. It stared back at her in silence. \"The silent treatment huh?\" She asked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened up and Thomas entered, looking over all of her paper-work with a serious grim look on his face. <br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Diana said exasperated. \"I feel like I've been here forever! So I take it I'm free to go? I want to track down however broke in and stole that Xpect drink\" <br>\r\nThomas just stared at the test results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Diana asked, slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"You're pregnant\" Thomas said rather point-blankly. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" Diana asked, not quite believing what she just heard.<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant. About two months. You - -- you didn't know?\" Thomas asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor felt like it dropped out from under her. HER? Pregnant? It was improbable. She hadn't been with anyone in a long, long time. Her only lover was her work. So how the hell could she be pregnant? And what the hell was she going to do? She didn't consider herself mother material. She wasn't crazy about children, and now there was one growing inside of her\u2026 for at least two-months! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana.. Whose the father?\" Thomas asked. <br>\r\n\"I\u2026 There is no father\" Diana said, her mind racing, grasping at something. <br>\r\n\"There has to be a father Diana. I mean, we're both scientists here. We know how babies are made. If you don't want to answer you don't have to, but if it someone here, i - - the company needs to know. We have to know if any possible contamination could have possible affected the fetus\" Thomas said, holding back emotion in his face. <br>\r\n\"There is no father! I can't possibly pregnant! I haven't had sex in a year Thomas! All i do is work, exercise, and sleep!\" Diana said snapping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you must have do SOMETHING else about two months ago. Are you sure you didn't hook up with someone at our monthly mixer nights?\" Thomas asked. <br>\r\n\"No dammit. Look, I don't how I got pregnant - - \" Diana answered back.<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's not go around in circles, I mean, let's no expect this\" Thomas words fell out after the words \"Expect\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything fell into place for Diana. It suddenly all made sense. <br>\r\nExpect.. XPECT! Two months! Fills you with life! Fake moon landing! Alligators in the sewers! The break-ins! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect!\" Diana said, slapping her forehead.<br>\r\n\"Yes, what did you expect - - \" Thomas said.<br>\r\n\"NO! NOT EXPECT! XPECT!\" Diana said, her hands pressed firmly against her midsection. <br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Thomas said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to present a scientific theory. Ready? What if that Xpect drink I got \"contaminated\" with got me pregnant. Listen okay? I can scientifically prove that I haven't had any \"relations\" in over a year, yet I'm two months pregnant. Two days ago, I came in contact with that unknown Xpect drink. That encounter lead to me getting some of it in my mouth. What if this drink, caused my pregnancy, and that perhaps each day is considered a month of pregnancy?\" Diana theorized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's seems highly farfetched.\" Thomas said. <br>\r\n\"Occum's razor. Simplest solution is often the correct one. This \"Xpect\" drink got me pregnant, and I'm going to prove it.\" Diana said.<br>\r\n\"So now what?\" Thomas asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me a journal, my voice recorder, a video camera, and all of my other stuff. I'm going to go out and track down someone or something that will help me uncover the truth. Along the way, I'll catalogue this pregnancy.\" Diana said, looking down at her midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Thomas asked. <br>\r\n\"Somewhat, but I have to do something. You in?\" Diana asked,<br>\r\nThomas nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start tracking down some of those people who commented on that commercial or the actress in it.\" Diana said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah checked her phone outside MegaGym, shielding her eyes from the sun. She'd hoped for a text from Diana to confirm a get-together for the old gang of three. Or something from Britney to confirm her tickets to tomorrow's lingerie show. Getting nothing, Sarah sighed and slipped her phone back into her tight pants (that were getting tighter each day). Less than wanting information about her activities for the rest of the week, Sarah wanted a distraction. As much as exercise helps, Rebecca and Megan's innocent little comments brought up a lot of memories about her ex and those thoughts were gnawing away at Sarah. It was Sarah's first long-term relationship and the break-up was so one-sided, so quick, so rude that it made Sarah feel one inch tall. Even thinking about it now, Sarah felt like she needed to start running with no destination in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sa-rah!\" Sabrina's sweeping voice said, taking Sarah out of her daze. \"There you are! Thank you for agreeing to drive me back as well. I have to get you tickets to my next show as a thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so nice,\" Sarah said, her voice wavering as she wondered how she could get out of one of Sabrina's community theater productions. \"Did you have a good workout? You should join my Femme-Fit class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might,\" Sabrina nodded. \"Exercise was far more invigorating than I was expecting. To be honest, in the past few days I felt a bit weary, but today I had so much energy and getting a good sweat going made me feel great!\" Sabrina took in a deep breath, drawing Sarah's attention to Sabrina's chest which had grown, just like so many other women she'd noticed. \"My lungs feel healthier too. I should be able to deliver much better lines now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear,\" Sarah smiled, waving to Hilary who was walking toward them now. Sarah had never exactly gotten along with Sabrina, but hearing her sing the good graces about working out at MegaGym was a much better conversation piece than Sabrina's last time as the nurse's understudy on a local production of Romeo and Juliet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilary joined the two, smiling softly. \"Thank you for the ride, Sarah. I feel like decades have melted away,\" she said, rolling her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd enjoy it, Ms. Perkins,\" Sarah smiled, walking toward her car now, Sabrina and Hilary following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I even signed up for your class, Sarah,\" Hilary beamed, opening the backseat door and sliding in, surprising herself with how mobile she was now. \"Now that I'm retired, working out might become the highlight of my week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't contain her smile. Okay, she could never contain her smile, but now it was noticeably larger and sunnier. She didn't need a relationship and she certainly wasn't the ugly, tiny woman the break-up made her feel like. Sarah was a fitness herald who helped other women get in shape and improve their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove, Sabrina and Hilary managed to chat, each taking turns talking about things the other couldn't care less about. Plays and \"personal journeys\" on Sabrina's side, past acquaintances and Jimmy Carter on Hilary's. Slowly, the chatter shifted toward Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel better now, but I'd still love to have this paunch gone soon,\" Sabrina said, patting her belly softly. \"You say it's bloating from the energy drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure of it,\" Sarah said, feeling like a broken record. A tiny fold of doubt started to form in her mind. This seems like a lot of side effects for one drink. Nausea, then intense cravings, plus increased energy and vivid dreams. Weight gain, shinier skin, healthier hair, tight ankles. \"Well, a friend of mine, a scientist, is actually looking at it now, so she'll confirm what I've been saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, in my day, we had a phrase about 'snake-oil salesmen,'\" Hilary said tentatively. \"Then again, I drank that nasty beverage too, so I'm just as gullible as everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything will be fine!\" Sarah said, parking quickly in front of the apartment and turning around to face Sabrina and Hilary. Her wide smile and intense, agitated eyes gave her face a distinctly creepy look. \"Okay? Everything will be fine! We feel good, we look good, we're great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina and Hilary nodded in fear and eased out of the car, unable to look away from Sarah's eyes. Sarah let out a big sigh and put the car in park, getting out and walking up into her room. She stretched out and opened up her laptop before checking her pockets for her wallet, keys, and phone. Good thing she did: there was a missed call from Diana. Sarah redialed immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Di,\" Sarah said, holding the phone with one hand as she checked email and Facebook with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I think I should come over to your apartment. I ran a few tests and I really need to talk to you about Xpect,\" Diana said, her voice nervous and hurried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure. I was just thinking about that,\" Sarah said, her eyes moving from posts to comments on Facebook. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd better tell you in person,\" Diana said. \"Is Britney there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate is moving back into town,\" Sarah choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am <u>definitely</u> coming over,\" Diana said, hanging up. Sarah slumped back into her chair, looking at the comment on a friend's status vacantly. &lt;Kate Becker commented: great, we can talk about it tomorrow. Just moved back in today!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was \"the\" ex in Sarah's life. She was everything that matched up in a beauty like Sarah's life. Gorgeous, smart, fun, good job as an ad executive. She and Sarah dated for two years and even flirted with the idea of moving in together and getting married one day and having kids, whether through adoption or the miracle of science. Then, one day, Kate just told Sarah she was bored by her and had been bored for a long time. \"A good body isn't enough anymore,\" Kate had said. \"Maybe if it was a great body. But living with you? Kids with you? I can do better for myself.\" Then Kate moved to an upscale neighborhood in Manhattan to work on a big project which looks like it just wrapped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt herself shudder, gripping her forearms to stop. She'd loved Kate and Kate broke her heart savagely. A knock at the door drew Sarah's attention, hoping it was Diana so she could have someone to help hug away the bad feelings. Instead, Maci stood there, shifting and looking around. \"Hi Sarah. Britney's not back yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry,\" Sarah said, furrowing her brow, noticing that Maci'd put on a bit of a gut too, as well as a larger pair of breasts. <i>She could use a trip to the gym too</i>, Sarah thought. \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just someone to talk to,\" she said quietly. \"See, today, Laci and I found out we're-\" Maci was cut off by the sound of Trisha and David walking up the stairs, talking in a hushed voice. \"Gottagobye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm as surprised as you are,\" Trisha whispered as the two got closer, Maci getting back inside and closing the door in just enough time to not be noticed. \"I mean, sure it's possible, but three months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they couldn't tell how many, but it was clear that it was more than one,\" David whispered. \"Twins again. Do you realize how much that will cost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not blame me for this, David,\" Trisha hissed. Sarah slowly closed the door behind her at this point, hearing more than she felt she should. As she walked back to her room, she got a call from Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah: got those tickets,\" Britney said, packing things off her desk as she held the phone between her shoulder and ear. \"There's also a kind of reception-meal thing afterward that I got you and Diana entry to. Should be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice, thanks,\" Sarah said. \"I think it'll be fun. Hey are you...coming back soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why? Actually, you sound kind of funny. Is something up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...come back when you can, okay?\" Sarah said, biting her lip. \"Bye Britney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Sarah,\" Britney replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Diana was at the door. Sarah tried to hold herself together, but her eyes welled up as soon as she saw her old friend. \"W-what's the news with Xpect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana opened her mouth, studying Sarah's face. This was not someone who needed the news that she might be pregnant due to a mystery energy drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, it's not important right now. Come here, hon,\" Diana said, opening her arms and letting Sarah dive right in, hugging her close and sobbing. \"Let's just talk, okay?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Britney walked in the door, stretching her back and hips as much as she could, groaning slightly. She might have been feeling better than in the past few days, but going up at least one-and-a-half cup sizes had its own problems. Imagine wearing a heavy backpack all day, but on your front. You'd be sore too. On top of that, her stomach felt tight. Not like a painful knot or the nausea she'd been experiencing, but the skin itself felt tight, like it was stretched over a drum. Looking at her growing gut in the mirror, Britney would have expected it to have the same squishy feeling of fat, but it was firm and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I'm home,\" Britney said, putting her purse and laptop bag down in a chair and walking around the apartment. \"You wanted to talk?\" Turning the corner, she found Diana and Sarah huddled together on the couch, Sarah in her brainy friend's arms. \"What's...what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was no longer crying, but Britney could see the puffy evidence still on Sarah's face. \"Kate's back in town,\" Sarah said in a monotone. Britney let out a long sigh, sitting on her opposite side and adding her embrace to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Sarah,\" Britney cooed. The three of them had been friends forever, but Britney and Sarah only became roommates in the aftermath of the infamous \"Kate break-up.\" Sarah thought her apartment carried too much \"negativity\" and wasn't close enough to the running paths she quickly became obsessed with, so Britney opened her home up to her fitness-obsessed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be doing better now though,\" Diana said, rubbing Sarah slowly on the arm. \"It helped to talk things over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it did,\" Sarah sighed, as if she hated to admit it. \"And the Xpect is probably still fueling my brain more efficiently so I'm producing more endorphins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay, sure,\" Diana said, wincing at the mention of \"Xpect\" again. Eventually, she'd have to tell Sarah the news. And whoever Sarah managed to feed this bizarre concoction to. \"But don't forget: Kate can't hurt you anymore. You're better than her. Too good for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're a fucking catch, Sarah,\" Britney said. \"Sexy, fun, good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sniffled and rubbed her nose. \"And I can cook and recommend all kinds of healthier options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana and Britney both looked at each other. \"Y...eah, that too,\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know what'll cheer you up: the show tomorrow,\" Britney smiled. \"Believe me, I've seen these models myself. They're all drop-dead gorgeous. You'll enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled a little. \"And there's an after-party with food where we can all talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Britney laughed. \"I'll introduce you to the other models personally.\" Sarah slowly sat up, wiping her eyes and chuckling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, a smile,\" Diana said, patting Sarah on the shoulder. \"At least this brought the three of us together again. Britney, you haven't changed at all. Well, except for-\" Diana got close to mentioning Britney's chest, clamming up quickly as she realized something. Sarah's breasts looked bigger too, and so were Diana's after drinking Xpect. Did Britney...drink this stuff too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney seemed to get the gist and looked down at herself, rolling her eyes. \"Yeah, I know. I'm...not sure what's going on but I think it might be related to that gross energy drink of Sarah's. I forgot to tell you Sarah: somehow I left some cans at Soft Lace and the models all had some, but they don't seem run down like we were yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lit Sarah up some. \"Great, maybe another potential partner? The gym, now Soft Lace. We could be looking at a revolution in cross-market advertising!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana started to feel pale. \"Wait, the gym? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stood up quickly, either ignoring or not hearing Diana's questions as the sunny personality everyone knew and loved about Sarah started to burst through once again. \"Alright, I'm not going to feel sad or sorry for myself anymore! I'm a great girlfriend and Kate's a dummy! Britney! Diana! Let's go out tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana and Britney looked at each other as Sarah stood with a big grin on her face. Sarah had a tendency to give these moving, movie-like lines that she thought would make the room swell with music and excitement but in reality they just came off as weird. After a few seconds, Diana nodded. \"O-okay, yeah! That sounds like fun. Should I meet you at-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time! Going out now! Wear one of my dresses!\" Sarah said as she bolted into her bedroom to change. Britney shrugged and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're going now,\" Britney said, walking into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah really hasn't changed much, has she?\" Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnope,\" Britney said, closing her door behind her. \"Here, you can change in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three decided to go to the same place they first met. It was an Americanized pub with the bar and regular tables and booths all intermixed. Sarah and Britney were both there, hanging out and chatting. Sarah was a few drinks in and was beginning to complain about being single. Britney was one month away from dumping a boyfriend at the time, and when Diana walked into the bar, Britney couldn't help herself from laughing at Sarah's obvious reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like her, go talk to her,\" Britney grinned. \"You're hot, she's hot, you'll do great together.\" Sarah slowly went over to Diana and did an astoundingly bad job of flirting. So bad that it took Diana a while to figure out what was going on, by which time they were already starting to like one another's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh!\" Diana finally exclaimed when Sarah asked if she'd like to get together sometime. \"Sorry, I'm...straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned bright red and apologized about 20 times before Diana got a chance to laugh and join her and Britney at their table, the three becoming close friends ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pub was pretty crowded when the three made it there today, getting a table across from the bar. \"Damn, I'm still crazy hungry,\" Sarah worried, biting her thumb as she looked over the various greasy burgers the place offered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did your class today. That burns a lot of energy, doesn't it?\" Britney said, feeling the same cravings as she read over the menu. Diana too, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I took a risk and ate a lot with Diana yesterday and look at me now,\" Sarah whined, leaning back, raising her shirt to show off her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big deal, that's happening to me too and I haven't been eating too much more,\" Britney said, smoothing out her top to reveal her own gut, emphasizing her breasts in the process. Diana turned bright red, the guilt eating her inside. The guilt and the sudden need for a milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to...Sarah?\" the waitress said. Sarah immediately recognized her as Megan from the Femme-Fit class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan! Oh my God! I didn't know you worked here,\" Sarah said excitedly. \"Megan, these are my two best friends in the whole world: Britney and Diana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three said hello before Megan turned back to Sarah. \"Actually, I've only been working here for about a week. I've waited tables before, so it's not a big transition, but my husband and I both decided we needed some more money in the house. And good timing too,\" she said, patting her belly. \"Anyway, can I get you all something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three paused before all ordering water. Megan nodded and smiled to turn before Sarah got her attention quickly. \"A-actually, is it okay if we put in our food orders now? I'm just feeling weirdly hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Megan said, getting the multiple burger, sandwich, and soup orders from the three of them before thanking the trio and heading to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry too? Or are you just making me feel better?\" Sarah laughed. \"And you guys can get some beer or something. Don't skimp out just because of me. I'd just rather not start tonight.\" She bowed her head a little. \"I feel like if I start now...I won't stop until it's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're doing great,\" Britney said, putting her hand on Sarah's back. \"And it's fine, I just don't feel like getting a beer tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they had kombucha, it would be a different story,\" Sarah said, seemingly to herself. \"It's made from black tea so it's a superfood and it's got alcohol in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana, what about you?\" Britney said. \"You always look so elegant with a glass of red wine in your hand. You could bring plenty of guys over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana laughed nervously. \"Oh please. The one who always brings guys over is Sarah. I don't know if that's irony or Murphy's Law or what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chuckled some more and Sarah turned to Diana. \"But yeah, why aren't you getting anything more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...don't feel like it,\" Diana said, turning red. \"I shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Britney both paused. \"Shouldn't?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...that's not what I meant,\" Diana said quickly, turning redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" Sarah asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana gripped her fists quickly and let out a little sigh. \"I'm pregnant.\" Britney and Sarah's eyes slowly got bigger as they prepared to get excited as Diana shook her head quickly. \"No, no, please. It's not...it's...I have to go.\" She grabbed her purse and headed out the door, brushing off the multiple guys at the bar who asked for her to wait up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this was fun for a little bit,\" Britney said, biting her lip. \"You won't...judge  me too hard if I suggest we split Diana's order, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to suggest that,\" Sarah said, still looking out the pub's door, worried for her expectant friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Sarah and Britney hung out at the pub, splitting Diana's rather large meal, the effects of the Xpect was being felt elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the apartment complex, most of the Hamiltons were sitting down to dinner, David Hamilton slightly annoyed that his \"So Goth\" daughter (as she frequently reminded them) was late for dinner, because he was very hungry. He usually watched what he ate, but lately his increased hunger these past few days had led him to put on a little bit of a belly. When accompanying his wife to the doctor's this afternoon (and receiving a huge shock, but not quite as big as the two he would have in 6 days), his pants were much tighter than he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Must be the stress from the house</i> David thought to himself. In addition to the very big announcement Trisha would tell the girls that evening, he had another announcement to be made: The house was finally settled. He kept it a secret for a while, looking for the right moment to surprise everyone, but after finding out about his the two new babies (damn the twins gene that ran in his veins), he might as well drop the bomb now. The construction company was bought out by another larger firm, and as part of the settlement with the Hamiltons and the dozens of other homeowners that were skewed over, the new financial company agreed to build (or finish) everyone's home free of charge, which to David, was a huge relief with two little ones on the way. Little did he know that the huge house was going to be much smaller and very soon as each and everyone one of the Hamiltons were having twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Laci?\" David asked, his hand subconsciously resting on the firm growing mound that was his belly, unaware of the son and daughter that were growing inside of him.  \"She's uh  - - - out\" Maci said, trying desperately to cover the pregnant belly she was now sporting under her clothes. It was weird, it was almost like Maci could feel it growing. \"Where's out?\" David asked, getting angry. His emotions have been on a roller coaster lately, and it was only going to get worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the mall.\" Maci said, her heart pounding in her chest. She was cracking, the big time bomb waiting to be dropped. Today was nothing but stress for her. First her parents tell her about some big announcement they want to make at dinner as soon as they come home, she can't talk to Britney or Sarah for advice, she just wanted to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures with that girl.\" David said to himself, hand still resting on the bump attached to his midsection. <br>\r\n\"Well, dinner will be served soon. Pasta, everyone's favorite. Go help your mother set the table.\" David said, as his daughter nodded, stood up (pulling down the fabric of her shirt trying to hide belly) and helped her mother in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a smiling goth (an oxymoron) was carrying bags upon bags up the stairs filled with stuffed monsters, black maternity clothes, a Mommy Kills Best branded breast pump, a book called \"So You're Growing Evil: A Metal Guide To Pregnancy\" By Mommy Kills Best, everything Laci Hamilton could ever need, except for the evil looking cribs, those were going to be delivered later. Laci was wearing a pair of tight black studded shorts that clearly hung the underside of a pale rounded belly, while a black shirt with tatters around the hemline covered the ample curves of her rounding dome. She bought the half shirt as a way to show off her belly, covering it in a new pale belly makeup she got as the maternity store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was turning the knob to enter the apartment, ready to melt her parents faces off\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, more activity was afoot around elsewhere..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Theresa looked around the restaurant anxiously, waiting for her date. It was crazy to date at her age, but dammit, why the hell not? She needed companionship. All she had was the Femme-Fit class, and while she fit in, she needed more in her life. Most of her friends her age where off seeing the world with their husbands, enjoying retirement and spoiling grandchildren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa had none of those things. While she had money, she had no husband and no grandchildren to spend it on. She always lived a quite life, maybe because as a Lesbian, she spent most of her life in hiding. Oh she had a few \"wild and crazy\" times back in her day, but those things weren't spoke of back then, and she didn't feel like she needed to live a lie to further what society thought was \"normal\" back then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it came as a surprise to her to find her date on an older lesbian dating site. She didn't think anyone would be interested in her at her age, let alone that anyone her age knew how to use a damn computer. She checked her watched and sighed, she was hoping that she wasn't being stood up again. It happened to her a lot. Women of her age and.. preference sometimes tended to lay low, still stuck in the \"old ways\" where these things were taboo. Her stomach rumbled, demanding food, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm so hungry. Where the hell is she? I'm going to start eating the table if she doesn't get her soon\" Theresa had a lot on her mind. Ever since trying that Xpect energy drink, she's been feeling.. off. First she was vomiting for two days straight, and then, her breasts started firming up, and even getting bigger. Her waistline seemed to expand as well thanks to the bloating, finding it harder to fit into the same clothes she'd warn for years. She talked to Sarah about it which calmed her mind, but still something seemed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got really bad when the pregnancy dreams started. They were all the same, her, 60-something year old, pregnant by the pool, letting it all hang out, while another beautiful pregnant woman kissed her belly and massaged her shoulder. She.. never had dreams like that before. She never once thought about having children, mostly because the technology for a woman of her.. persuasion was not available to her. And when it was, the idea of children just was never there, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, it seemed as she had on her mind was pregnancy and babies. It was distracting her from this date, if the date ever started when her date got there. She scratched the firm round mound visible behind the sleek and sexy red dress she poured herself into, cursing the Xpect and the bloating that came with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to get up and leave when her date approached her. She was wearing a black dress that clung as well to the odd very visible bulge in her midsection, which she was trying to cover up with her hands. She was beautiful  in her old age, Thersea thought.  She had the look of a woman who was nervous about doing this kind of thing. Theresa liked that in her women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I was late, I couldn't find anything that fit - - I mean, I liked. Sorry, I've never done anything like this before.. I mean be with a woman - I mean go out with a woman..\" The date smiled nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. It's unusual for women our age\" Theresa stood up and pull out the seat for her date, who took a seat, the bulge in her stomach more visible as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I think you're name was Hilary Perkins wasn't it?\" Thersa asked, and Ms. Perkins smiled nervously back. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, alright, everyone focus,\" Rohan, the tall, fit, improv class instructor said. His hair was neatly shaved close to his scalp and his sleeves were rolled up as he tried to get his class's attention, his muscle tone giving his black forearms an unreal mix of attractiveness and intimidation. All the students in the class couldn't believe he was even in this rinky-dink college classroom teaching improv to aspiring actors at night. \"Now, we've done comedy work over the past few weeks, so let's do a simple, dramatic scene. Let's see, how about Lori and...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRohan was trying to ignore the obvious eyelash-blinking that Sabrina was doing in the front row - her bizarre way of trying to get attention. Her hands were crossed over her lap, trying to hide the growing bulge that lay just above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Sabrina,\" Rohan sighed, waving the two over. Lori strolled over in her usual short-girl bounce and Sabrina took her Broadway gait, as if she was about to treat the class to a rare performance. \"Alright, good. Now: scene, scene. Anyone got one for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're mother and daughter and the mother just discovered a secret of the daughter's,\" Gisele said from the back. Rohan nodded silently and took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, nothing too extravagant, just try to embody these characters and create some dialogue,\" Rohan said. \"And, go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, who's who?\" Sabrina said, tossing her hair softly as she turned to Rohan. Whether it was on purpose or a habit by this point, even the narrator can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class laughed softly and Rohan tried not to groan out loud. \"Well, Sabrina, it would make the scene flow more easily if the...more experienced actor played the mother, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina steamed beneath the surface as she turned back to Lori, her \"daughter.\" She was only in her late 20s, but Sabrina was the oldest one in the whole class. Even Rohan was probably a year behind her. And being a 30-year-old actor with nothing on her portfolio but community theatre and one commercial was something that worried Sabrina immensely. At least her skin was looking much nicer over the past few days so she could pass as younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll start then,\" Lori said, looking awkwardly between Rohan, Sabrina, and the class. She mimed opening and closing a door and took a few tiny steps toward the table between her and Sabrina. \"Hey Mom, home from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lori, could I speak with you please?\" Sabrina said coldly, crossing her arms. \"I was cleaning your room today and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, trust me, I've got everything under control, okay? I'm getting good grades, I've got plenty of friends, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was starting to be gripped, wondering what would come next. \"That doesn't matter to me, young lady. Would you explain this to me?\" Sabrina held out her hand, holding nothing but air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...it's not what you think,\" Lori said, biting her lip. Rohan nodded silently. <i>Not bad for improvised drama</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what I think? Well, to me, it looks like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pills, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pregnancy test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class furrowed their brows as Lori and Sabrina both looked at each other confused. In an attempt to build the scene, they'd both just spoken at the same time but said slightly different things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I...uh,\" Lori said, wondering what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, it's no surprise,\" Sabrina said, blushing with embarrassment. \"I mean, look at your stomach. You do so many sports at school, so how are you getting so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Lori's turn to blush, covering her actual burgeoning bump with her hands. \"W-well what about you? You're not looking so slim yourself. Are you going to be a mom again before you're a grandma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, that's enough,\" Rohan said, sighing and rubbing his temples. \"Please, return to your seats and we'll...discuss what you did well and what you could have improved and use that as a way for everyone to think more about their own acting skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina and Lori returned to their seats as Rohan said, both nervously running their hands over their middles, thinking about each other's words. Could they be...pregnant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and class ended, the room of aspiring actors leaving as Rohan got out his phone while thanking the men and women. &lt;Hey babe, done here. Where to eat?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You pick&gt; his boyfriend, Darren, sent back in no time. &lt;Meet you out front in 15&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina walked to the parking lot, her anger from the beginning of class mostly worn off by now. On the way, she noticed Lori and smiled. \"Hello Lorelei,\" she said in her theatrical voice. \"I apologize for class. I just got wrapped up in my character. I meant nothing by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Lori said with a little smile. \"I shouldn't have snapped back the way I did but it at least made for some pretty good dialogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Sabrina nodded. \"You know, the local theatre (pronounced with the most unreasonable amount of flair) is accepting entries for short-form plays and there is impressive turn-out planned. A vignette about a pregnant mother and daughter could earn a place at that show. Would you be interested in...working on that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori thought about it, nodding softly. \"Actually, that's not a bad idea. And it would get us some good exposure.\" She grinned. \"Well, I'm glad we had that outburst after all, Sabrina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Sabrina laughed. And for the first time in many, many months, it wasn't a fake stage laugh. \"Ah, the night is young! Would you like to dine out somewhere and try and talk this over some more, and explore one another's personalities and dreams to enrich our performances?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...food sounds good,\" Lori said. \"I've been getting so hungry lately, it's awful. I need to set a better example at my gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off we go then!\" Sabrina said, walking with Lori down the street. On the way, Lori saw a familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina? Oh...oh my god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Lori,\" Nina said, sweating and breathing heavily as she stopped her intense waddle. While Nina had a big belly when Lori last saw her two days ago, now she was...bigger. Her co-worker was struggling to even cover her immense pregnant size now, which had ballooned to the size of an exercise ball. \"I...I know. In case it's bloating or something like that, I'm trying to walk it off. Or at least induce labor so it doesn't get any bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get bigger? You mean it's been growing for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the past few days, yeah,\" Nina laughed painfully. \"I'm going to the doctor first thing in the morning. If the past two days have been any indication, I won't even be able to cover this thing up by then,\" she said, patting her baby-filled orb, getting some frantic kicks in return. \"Oof, well, that's my cue to keep walking. See you tomorrow, I suppose. I've still got a class to teach after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see you tomorrow,\" Lori said, turning around and watching her friend waddle away. \"At least she doesn't look pregnant from behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So strange,\" Sabrina said, shaking her head. \"Reminds me of an obscure play I once came across. A horrible spoiled girl finds a coin that turns her and her wealthy family into hugely pregnant women. I always wondered how they managed to perform it on stage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to be careful if I ever get pregnant,\" Lori said. \"I'm so short, proportionally, any belly I get is going to be much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the parking lot, Gisele was getting into Nico's car, with Michelle in the passenger's seat. \"Good class?\" Michelle asked, looking at Gisele in the rear view mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I guess so,\" Gisele said. \"Two girls got into a spat which was kind of fun to watch. Where are we going to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new Japanese place. We've both had this crazy craving for sushi,\" Nico purred. \"And Michelle here found a handsome guy to foot most of the bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle smiled and rolled her eyes. \"Hey, you could both get someone to treat you too. Gisele, lower your shirt a few inches and you'll get credit cards on top of credit cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele chuckled and rubbed under her breasts. \"Speaking of which, are we really going to ask Darren for a bigger size tomorrow? It feels so unprofessional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can we do? We can't wear lingerie that's too tight,\" Michelle shrugged. \"Britney's having the same problems too, so she can't say no. It's probably that damn drink. I knew it didn't look natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Monica saying about it?\" Gisele muttered. Michelle was about to roll her eyes and respond but Nico cut them both off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the rehearsal yesterday, I saw her on the phone on the side of the building and she was crying,\" she said, looking over at Michelle and Gisele. \"Something is going on in that girl's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd say that she needs to learn to balance life and her work, but honestly, she's the best model out of all of us. Even Britney,\" Gisele said. Michelle and Nico both nodded. \"Ugh, enough negativity. Tomorrow's our first big show! Let's eat and re-lax. I've got a craving for fish now too!\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't know there would be all these families too. The only reason I came was because I figured college girls would hang around here.\" He looked at his meal with a disapproving stare. \"Food's better at the sports bar too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all made healthy here,\" Jim said. \"Vegan pizza, lean lamb kebobs, gluten-free local beer. Besides, you could use some better diet choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry looked down at his bulging gut, which was filling with a future athlete instead of fatty foods, and then back at Jim with anger. \"You're one to talk. I'm starting to think that yoga isn't the workout you always say it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim scowled back. Terry was right: Jim was getting pretty big around the middle too, thanks to Xpect's enchanting and impregnating properties that didn't do much to distinguish between men or women. \"Hey, I'm trying to be healthy too. You think I like eating this stuff? I'm not Sarah, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. It was probably her weird drink that caused this anyway. Some sort of indigestion or bloating or gas build-up,\" Terry said. As they found a part of the food truck park with fewer screaming kids and teenagers making-out, Terry and Jim stopped walking around and focused on their own food. \"So what do you think about this athletic competition at the gym? It's in less than a week now and I don't know how well we're going to pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim shrugged and ripped out a big chunk of spinach and soy-blue cheese pizza with his teeth. \"It all comes down to how many people sign-up, I guess. The deadline isn't until the day of the contest so I'll bet there will be a big influx right before. I trust Emily to pull it off.\" He looked around the park and tapped Terry on the arm. \"Speak of the devil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, with her brown curls and growing belly, saw the two of them and walked over, waving a little. \"Hello, funny seeing both of you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not our usual stomping ground,\" Terry smiled. He came here to meet women, and even if it's his boss, a hot girl's a hot girl. \"So what are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually,\" Emily said, turning around and bringing her voice down to a hush. \"I'm here with a friend. She just had a pretty bad break-up and I'm trying to cheer her up, get her out of her apartment.\" Spying her friend, Emily waved her over. \"Be nice to her, okay? She's quiet but she'll open up if you treat her well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be nice to her, alright,\" Terry said when he spied Emily's friend, Monica. She had on a white blouse with ruffles down the front, her already impressive chest increased in size thanks to the growing force inside her womb. If Terry and Jim's eyes weren't immediately drawn there, they might have noticed the sloping going on in her midsection. It was tight and concentrated around her front abdomen and while it was maybe unusual for a lingerie model, it was still a modest, gentle pot belly. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica, these are two of my coworkers, Terry and Jim,\" Emily said with a smile, motioning to her two fitness instructors. Both nodded and smiled, eyes moving to Monica's gorgeous, composed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Monica replied, waving a bit before moving her hand back to her forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you do?\" Jim said, quickly trying to wipe the crumbs and cheese from his fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a model,\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Terry and Jim said in unison, both of their lips spreading into even wider smiles, their eyes flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down, boys,\" Emily snarked, rolling her eyes as she turned to Monica. \"Are you sure you don't want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I felt kind of nauseous the past few days and it's still a little residual. Besides, I've got the big show tomorrow.\" Monica looked back at Emily and her worried face. \"I'm fine, really. I'm not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not missing much,\" Terry said, eating the last pieces of his kebob. \"Personally, I wanted to get some burgers and fries. Models can eat those, can't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle belched up in Monica's stomach, accompanied by a flare-up of cravings. \"Yeah, we can,\" Monica said with a little laugh. \"Not many do, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're the exception?\" Jim smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica smiled. \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wasn't thrilled about her coworkers hitting on her troubled friend, but it didn't seem to be bothering her for now and she was at least starting to smile and laugh with strangers. \"Well, if you all want to go get junk food, I might as well join you.\" Emily tried to picture the look on Terry and Jim's face when she revealed that Monica wasn't exactly interested in men and thought that was reason enough to go along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four made their way to the parking lot, another familiar face came their way. \"Oh my God, Terry! Jim! Emily!\" Rebecca said with a big smile and open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, hi,\" Terry said, nodding along. Rebecca had been at the top of his \"Coworkers I Want To Bang\" list for quite some time, but since she started going steady with a new boyfriend, he was sadly forced to move her to the \"Unattainable\" category, also occupied by Nina for being pregnant and Sarah for being crazy. It was a very complicated system, especially considering he had never even gotten close to having sex with anyone he worked with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, this is my friend, Monica,\" Emily said, trying to introduce the two. Introducing Monica to Jim and Terry seemed to work out pretty well. \"She's a lingerie model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rebecca said, sounding much more surprised than Terry or Jim. \"I mean, you've got big tits, but doesn't the flabby belly make it harder to get work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's freckles hid most of her blushing, but it was pretty strong. \"I-I still get work and I think it's a side effect from when I was sick,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright,\" Rebecca shrugged, resting against the tall, strapping guy beside her. \"Babe, introduce yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm Tony, I'm Rebecca's boyfriend,\" he smiled, wrapping one arm around Rebecca's hip. \"Hey, got any ideas for some lingerie I can buy for my girl? She won't take any of my suggestions for sexy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tony!\" Rebecca giggled and gasped, pushing against him playfully. \"I'll get you back for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Tony grinned, the two reaching down to kiss quickly. No one watching was particularly comfortable, but Monica's embarrassment was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica, are you dating anyone we know?\" Rebecca asked when she finally broke away from her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm single,\" Monica said, trying to put some confidence back into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're so cute though,\" Rebecca said. \"Well, maybe it's the belly. I can see some guys being picky about that. Maybe join MegaGym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe,\" Monica said, her hands tightening around her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily could read the situation and got a little closer to Monica. \"Well, we were just leaving, but see you at work tomorrow, bright and early,\" Emily said, the four of them walking past Rebecca and Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, bye!\" Rebecca said, turning back to Tony and groaning. \"I hate seeing coworkers outside of the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tony said, nodding along, not really knowing what to say. \"I'm going to get a beer. Want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No boo, I told you, I feel sick when I think about alcohol,\" Rebecca said in a pouting voice. \"Just buy me some ice cream, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Terry, Jim, Emily, and Monica made it to their cars, Monica leaned in to her friend. \"I don't...feel up to this. Can you just drive me back to my place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Emily said. \"Are you feeling sick again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just feel like I'm going to bring things down,\" Monica said, getting into the passenger's seat, taking a deep breath and trying to keep her mind off of her break-up. \"Some memories got brought up and...you understand, right Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do,\" Emily said, getting in the other side and turning on the car. \"Just text or call me if anything comes up, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Monica nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know you feel bad now, but I can't say it enough,\" Emily said, taking Monica's hand in her own. \"You're too good for Kate and nothing she said matters.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her date watched in amazement as Peggy continue to gorge herself on the several hundred dollars a plate dinner he had his best chefs prepare for her. He wasn't disgusted, far from it. He was enthralled by her appetite. A man wouldn't usually see this kind of eating habits with a single woman pushing forty, but Peggy wasn't a usual woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he first met her on the dating website, he figured \"what the hell\". But seeing her in person, (even if she had a little bit of firm potbelly behind that slinky blue dress she wore), watching her eat, he could always appreciate a woman who could eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy let out a little belch, blushing profusely as she was mortified. She normally didn't eat like this, hell, she hardly ever ate at all. But lately she's been starving, with strange cravings for something or other. She was worried that her eating like a pig (and imagining Sarah coming in and chastising her in that oh-so-sweet fitness trainer voice she does) that her date, the owner of Carte Blanch would immediately not want another date with her. However, it looked like he was looking at her with love in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anyone eat like that before, except for maybe my sister, but she's pregnant\" He said. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you have a sister?\" Peggy asked, trying to steer the conversation away from her eating habits. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's a fitness trainer, works at some gym somewhere. Her names Nina. Haven't seen her in the past few days\" He said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy looked around the high-class eatery. It was a five-star fine dining establishment. All of her life Peggy never thought she would be on a date with a man like this. <br>\r\nCelebrities, politicians, vips ate here all the time, and her she was, at the owner's private table, enjoying a meal (or several) absolutely for free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place\" Peggy said, finishing her third plate. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. I've worked very hard on it.\" He said. \"You know this is the hottest and classist place in town. Just tonight I'm expecting some of the models from a local fashion shoot to come in tonight to dine our sushi. I've got my best chef working on personally.\" <br>\r\n\"Wow\" Peggy said a little dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly across the dining room, Peggy spotted someone that looked somewhat familiar to her.. Was that? No it couldn't be. But looking closer, it was in fact, Theresa having what appeared to a very personal and very private dinner with another woman around her some age. \"Is that Theresa?\" Peggy asked, looking over to her gym co-goer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of yours?\" He said, looking over at Theresa, who sported a much larger potbelly that hugged the confines of her dress, just like Peggy.<br>\r\n\"Me and her talk a lot when we do our gym classes together. She's a nice older lady. Dosen't really have anyone in her life\" Peggy said. <br>\r\n\"Why don't we have her and her friend join us? I'd love to get to know your friends\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy placed a small hand on her firm potbelly, and could have sworn she felt it move. Nerves she thought. She didn't know what to say, she didn't want to blow this date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at this moment, the models walked in, each potbelly leading the way... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't believe what I just did,\" Sarah said, shaking her head over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, it's okay,\" Britney said, reaching over to take her friend's hand and comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not Britney.\" Sarah took a deep breath. \"I had a cheesecake. I had a huge, greasy dinner and then I had a cheesecake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a big dinner and a dessert too,\" Britney said with a compassionate smile. \"You'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're a little different,\" Sarah said, in a tone that showed it wasn't as much of an insult to Britney as it sounded. \"I have to stay in shape and the slightest big I fall back, any of this poison I put into my body-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney groaned loudly. \"Alright, you are more of a downer talking about eating junk than when we talk about Kate. See if your friend will come over so we can pay the bill and go have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue, Megan walked over. \"Enjoy everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Britney said, grinning and giving Sarah a piercing look as she handed Megan her credit card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet. Seeing your meals made me wish my shift was up so I could eat some too. Although some of that might be the cravings,\" Megan chuckled. \"They've been coming on pretty strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good thing Diana isn't here, then</i>, Sarah thought before turning to Megan, putting her hand on her student's shoulder and bringing her close. \"Megan, you are wonderful and an inspiration in so many ways, but if you tell anyone at MegaGym about the meal you saw me have today, I will make you run so many laps you will sweat the memory out of your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan laughed. \"Don't worry. It's just nice to see that my FemmeFit instructor is human just like me.\" She took Megan's card and thanked them, heading back to another part of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to get the bill,\" Sarah said, turning to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. We invited you out to make you feel better, of course I'm going to pay for you,\" Britney said. \"Tonight is my treat. We do what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already doing enough, letting me get tickets to the fashion show tomorrow,\" Sarah said. \"After-show passes too. I feel like such a celebrity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney laughed. \"Well, I'm glad you're excited. I've tried to keep you and Diana from seeing me in lingerie as much as I can, but I suppose it all ends tomorrow.\" She made an exaggerated sad sigh. \"Oh well. All good things must come to an end.\" Megan returned with her card and the two thanked her, heading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked for a block or two, not saying anything, before Sarah turned to Britney. \"Did you know Diana was pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney shook her head. \"News to me. I didn't know she was seeing anyone. Whenever we talked, she complained that she was too busy to even have casual sex. I guess that explains why she was kind of embarrassed about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should get in touch with her soon, talk with her,\" Sarah said. \"If she's upset, we need to let her know that we're fine and we'll support her with whatever she needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney agreed. \"I should tell you: she's not the only one in our life who just found out they're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned to Britney with huge eyes and stopped dead on the sidewalk. \"Britney...you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. No!\" Britney said, blushing. \"Laci and Maci, our twin neighbors. They had me buy them each a pregnancy test and it came out positive for both of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started walking again, furrowing her brow. \"Wow, I didn't think Laci was in to the other sex, but I guess even a gay woman can have faulty gaydar. I feel bad for them being so young, but I am kind of curious to see what a pregnant goth looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney laughed and quickly tried to stifle it. \"I know what you mean. Laci was actually pretty excited about it. Maci, poor girl, was pretty crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"We just can't seem to get cheery tonight. C'mon, there must be something we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney gave a little smile, remembering that this night was supposed to be all about her friend. \"How about this: let's go for a run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at Britney in dismay. \"A-are you serious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney nodded, putting an arm around Sarah's shoulder. \"Well, I know how much you've always wanted to run under the streetlights but you're nervous about doing it alone so this will be my gift to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hesitated before giving Britney a back-breaking bear hug, coming close to lifting her friend off the ground, their swelling breasts pressing against one another and causing Sarah to stop the hug. As long as Britney and Sarah knew one another, Sarah had wanted Britney to go running with her, but Britney always said no. Britney may have exercised regularly at MegaGym to stay fit, but she wasn't the enthusiast that Sarah was. Exercise, stretching, running. It all made Britney pretty tired and miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's head home and get changed,\" Sarah said. \"For you, I'll make it a shorter run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks. You-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-just 10K tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-didn't have to,\" Britney said slowly, forcing a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed back to the apartment, hearing some loud noises from the Hamilton apartment. Sarah and Britney both grimaced, sure that David and Trisha just heard the news from their daughters expecting daughters of their own. After a quick change, Britney walked out of her room into the living room, clad in an old white t-shirt, a hair-tie, and a pair of leggings. To her surprise, Sarah came out in a tight top that revealed a good amount of her cleavage and incredibly short running shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sarah,\" Britney said, finding it hard to avert her eyes from Sarah's prominent chest, which like her own chest, had taken on a lot more size lately. \"You've got a new outfit, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, they had it at MegaGym as part of a promotional test giveaway,\" Sarah said. \"I want to see if it'll be more comfortable with the...swelling that's been going on lately.\" She moved one had to her potbelly, unaware of the additional swelling that was stirring inside her at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay,\" Britney said, hoping that the eyes of passersby would at least be on someone other than her on this run. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe run went about as well as Britney expected. Eating a ton of food and then trying to run 10 kilometers while keeping up with Sarah Richardson was difficult, especially when adding the increased chest and belly size Britney had been experiencing. At the corner, Sarah stopped, hands on her hips as she waited for the traffic to clear. Britney was doubled over, panting. \"G-good run for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm!\" Sarah beamed, face dripping with sweat. \"This outfit is good, just like I thought, but I shouldn't have eaten before running. I'm starting to get a little tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney let out a groan as the light turned and Sarah headed off again. Just as Britney suspected, every step made Sarah's chest bounce and its open cleavage made the whole package glisten with sweat. Britney's chest was probably just as impressive as Sarah's, but concealed behind her shirt and sports bra, Sarah got all the shocked and lewd looks. The shorts also made Sarah's ass stick out and it was clear to Britney that that had grown over the past few days too, not unlike her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Once the belly goes away, I might have to offer her a job modeling in our next show</i>, Britney thought, stumbling a little and reaching out to Sarah. \"Sarah! Sarah! Can we...take a...water break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah slowed down and jogged back to Britney. \"Sure, there's a water fountain two blocks over.\" Sarah stopped and put her hand on Britney's back. \"I know this isn't what you like to do and you're just doing it to make me feel better, but I really, really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney stood up slowly with a small smile. \"You're welcome. I'd do anything to cheer you up. You're one of my best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you made me feel better just by offering,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can stop?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we have to keep going now. Clearly, you're in terrible shape,\" Sarah said. \"C'mon, two blocks to the water fountain!\" Sarah bolted off and Britney dropped her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to puke,\" Britney groaned. \"And not because of that dumb drink.\"</span></div></div>",

There wasn't much for her to rub and caress, but there was enough rounding that it was clear that Laci wasn't lying about her pregnancy. She'd moved the bags of pregnancy and baby items into the room she shared with Maci, her typical sorority girl sister and was back in the family kitchen, eagerly dropping the news about her pregnancy. \"Mom, you caught me with my face between my teacher's legs before so this can't come as that much of a shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha blushed and lifted her head. \"Honey, there can't just...not be a father. Someone had to be involved for you to get pregnant. Did you go to a sperm bank?\" In the excitement of it all, she hadn't even gotten to deliver the news to her daughters that she was pregnant with another pair of twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci shook her head. \"Nope. My belly just started getting big all on its own. Personally, I'm hoping I was finally chosen to bear the Anti-Christ or some other demon offspring.\" She paused, thinking it over. \"I'd settle for an alien pregnancy, I suppose. As long as it's the pre-text for a coming invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stomped his foot, much to the dismay of their downstairs neighbors. \"This is not a joke, Laci! Your mother and I are not stupid. You can't just suddenly become pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes you can,\" Maci managed to get out, looking up from her plate at her parents. \"Mom...Dad...I'm pregnant too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Trisha stopped their interrogation of Laci and turned to their other daughter, faces shocked. \"Sweetie...\" Trisha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I didn't have sex either,\" Maci said, hands crossing over her slight belly even more tightly. \"I mean, I'm not a lesbian like Laci-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want you either,\" Laci cackled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Laci. But I took a pregnancy test and it came up positive. And my belly's been getting bigger, my breasts feel funny, I have these weird cravings. And I haven't had sex with anyone-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not lately,\" Laci laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut UP, Laci!\" Maci stood up to yell at her sister after her second interjection, her belly now visible to her parents. \"You both believe me, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rubbed his forehead, frustrated. \"You both took pregnancy tests?\" he said. \"Where did you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey clammed up, not wanting to get Britney in trouble. Maci figured she'd need her neighbor's help if she was going to survive this pregnancy under her strict parent's roof and Laci wanted to keep Britney on as a life-line in place of the horrifying sunny Sarah. \"Just at the local convenience store,\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably some defective, cheap brand,\" David sighed, sitting down at the table. \"You should have let us know so we could have gotten you a proper test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll still take you both to the doctor's tomorrow,\" Trisha said, smiling softly. \"I'm sure it's nothing. We're all a little stressed, having to stay at this apartment while we try to get the new house and we were all sick a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not,\" Laci said, moving to the dinner table, sticking her limited belly out proudly, her dark top showing off her midriff while clinging tightly to her growing chest. \"I've wanted to be pregnant forever. Feeling something foreign grow inside you, kick and squirm deep in your womb, suck off your nutrients and blood? What could be more metal than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci shuddered. \"I wish you'd stop talking like that. Being pregnant means getting big and fat. No more parties, no more flirting, no cute little outfits to wear while you sit out in the sun with your friends. I might as well have a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a thought,\" David said, rolling his eyes as he dished out the pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope neither of you are pregnant just yet, but when you want to be pregnant, it can be a wonderful experience,\" Trisha said. \"Laci, it's nice to feel your children inside you, and Maci, I thought I looked very beautiful when I had both of you. And being pregnant isn't just about the changes your body goes through. It's about welcoming some important people into your life.\" Trisha put her hands on Laci and Maci's shoulders. \"And I was lucky enough to get two at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" the two groaned, rolling their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha chuckled and bit her lip. \"And I'm getting a chance to do that again now.\" Laci and Maci both turned to their mother in shock. \"Your father and I went to the doctor's yesterday and...I'm pregnant. With twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Maci said, putting her hands in her head. \"I'm going to be pregnant alongside my mom. This is a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci laughed out loud. \"I must have cast a spell wrong and got the whole apartment pregnant. Dad, maybe you should pee on a strip too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" David grumbled, putting a big helping of linguine on his plate. \"You're both still not off the hook. Even if it turns out that these pregnancy tests were defective, you both snuck out and got these tests without coming to your mother and I first. And if...if you are both pregnant than we are all going to have a long conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha hung her head sadly and proceeded to fill her own plate, cravings taking hold of her. Thankfully, they were strong enough that she made enough pasta to feed all four of the pregnant Hamilton family members. She was so excited when she found out she was pregnant for a second time and wanted to share it with her family. It would be the perfect timing too, as the new house was being opened up. But instead, Maci thought it was gross and embarrassing, Laci was wrapped up in her own goth oddities, and David seemed more upset and stressed since he got the news. Who could she share her pregnancy with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid ate eagerly, unaware of his own twins, when his cellphone buzzed in his pocket. \"Shit, hold on,\" he said, walking out to the apartment complex's open hallway to take the call. More complications with the construction buy-out. He was still getting the house, but future contracts didn't look too promising. When he finished the call, he sighed and rested his head against the wall, sighing. It was pretty late out, the complex's lights giving just enough illumination to see around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes when he would get stressed, as he often did, David would loiter outside the apartment, mainly for his neighbors. He started to time his trips to the mailroom and garbage room with Sarah's morning runs so he could see her in her tight exercise clothes. Britney wasn't bad looking either and he constantly tried to convince Trisha to go buy something at Soft Lace so he could see Britney model the lingerie options. Sabrina was a nice, curvy woman too and she seemed happier to chat with him than either Sarah or Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lately, they'd all looked bustier too. Sabrina definitely had a fatter ass. David's angry scowl curled into a creepy grin, thinking about the women in the building. He'd never cheated on Trisha but he thought about it. A lot. And even tried at a few construction conventions, but with no luck. And if Trisha was going to have a big pregnant stomach again, he wouldn't even have her to release his frustrations into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if his company had been bought out better, he'd have more cash to wave around and maybe he'd be able to get one of his neighbors to join him in bed. Until then, where could he casually meet them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gym,\" David said quietly to himself, stroking his chin. \"Of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach began to gurgle and David noticed his hand on his bulging belly, putting it away quickly. <i>Back to dinner for now</i>, he thought, trying to wipe away his lustful grin. <i>And later I'll bring up a subscription to MegaGym</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know how far that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6.2 miles,\" Brittany said, panting heavily as she tried to move her stiff, on-the-verge-of-cramping legs up each step. \"32,808 feet. 393,701 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! You've been paying attention,\" Sarah said, easily making it to the top of the stairs. She was taking in deep breaths too and all of the revealing skin she had was covered in sweat. Still, Sarah was a fitness pro and ran more than this on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I counted,\" Brittany responded as she finally made it to the top of the staircase. She was bright red and her white t-shirt was completely soaked through with sweat, giving anyone who watched her run for the past few kilometers a good look at her bra and chest. \"But did you enjoy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had the apartment open and was already walking in when she responded. \"I did. I always knew running with you would be fun and it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany's breathing settled down as she walked into the apartment. \"Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Brittany closed the door, Sarah was right up against her friend, head hung down, fists quivering a little. Before either could say anything, Sarah hugged Brittany tightly. Not the absurdly strong, super happy hug she so often gave out. The hug of someone who'd just been shown a great time by a best friend after some bad memories had been dug up. \"Thank you, Brittany,\" Sarah muffled out, face pressed against Brittany's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany let out a little sigh and smiled, petting Sarah's wet hair. \"You'll be fine, Sarah. You're so much stronger than you realize.\" Brittany felt her chest getting wetter, and not because of the sweat. Sarah's body was starting to tremble as she started to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...why did she do it? I just don't understand,\" Sarah whimpered, gripping Brittany's shirt more tightly as the emotional weight of Kate's nasty break-up gave one last throe for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh,\" Brittany said, petting Sarah's hair. \"She was a stupid person for not seeing what a great woman she had. You'll be so much better without her and you'll find someone who makes you feel...everything you want to feel.\" Brittany leaned down and gave Sarah a little peck on her hairline. \"Now come on, it's got to reek pressing your nose against here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah brought her face back up, eyes red, and sniffled a little, smiling as she wiped one eye. \"It's the smell of your brain releasing negative chemicals through your pores. Running releases-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Brittany laughed, giving Sarah a quick hug before heading to her room. \"It's that kind of talk that got us drinking Xpect. I'll shower then we can watch some Netflix, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sarah smiled, going to her own bathroom. Stepping into the shower, Sarah traced her breasts carefully with her fingertips as the water ran over her. <i>Definitely bigger than yesterday</i>, she sighed. <i>Maybe even bigger than this morning. Acai berries and anti-oxidants and all of the stuff they put in Xpect can do amazing things but...this does seem kind of odd</i>. She stroked her growing belly - ugh, she hated admitting that she had a belly, but there it was - as she tried to think positively. She just had a great run with a great friend, she had another friend with a baby on the way, and she had her class full of women who were getting better because of her. Plus, tomorrow she'd get to see Brittany's lingerie show. And see all of those models she works with, walking up and down the runway in nothing but lacy, tiny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her lip as she curled her fingers up, savoring the feel of her pubic hair before she started teasing her insides. Sarah knew she had done this in...in a long time. Maybe since first meeting Kate. She definitely didn't touch herself after the break-up. Her mental state was in tatters and all she could think about was running and working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something in the past few days had made Sarah...fantasize more. In her mind, maybe it was knowing the lingerie show was coming up or maybe it was just one of those things. In reality, her body was starting to produce a dizzying new line of hormones that was playing with her mind. Sarah didn't masturbate for long, just enough to make her coo a bit. She didn't want to waste water, and besides, Brittany was waiting for her outside. Sarah soaped up, noting how big her rear had gotten since this morning as well, and washed off, toweling off and slipping into a soft bathrobe, giving herself a little cuddle before joining Brittany on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was similarly dressed, hooking her laptop to the TV, when Sarah joined her. Brittany was, of course, well aware of Sarah's sexual orientation but this had never caused any sexual tension or awkward moments between them. Sarah put it to Brittany quite frankly in the early moments of their relationship. \"You're just not my type,\" Sarah shrugged. \"I don't know how else to explain it. You're great looking and you're fun to be around but...you just don't do anything for me. And even if you did, it's not like I'd try to get a relationship started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thanks?\" Brittany said. \"I've been told I'm 'not someone's type' plenty of times before but this is the first time it doesn't feel like an insult.\" Brittany looked down at her body, curious about what it is about her that made her \"not Sarah's type.\" \"Is it...my chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes, a little more sarcastic back then. \"Well that wouldn't be fair of me, would it? No, I like busty girls fine, but it's lot all I go after. Besides, if I ever want to feel some big breasts, I've got these,\" Sarah said, fondling herself playfully, raising her eyebrows up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <u>is</u> an upside to having them,\" Brittany nodded, wondering if Sarah was vain or just odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was years and years ago and the question at the moment was what the two would watch tonight. \"Something light-hearted, I'm guessing,\" Brittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want to watch VHS 2,\" Sarah said, back shivering. \"I don't know why you put that in your list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave my account to a friend,\" Brittany said, shaking her head. \"90s teen movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Sarah said excitedly, before sinking back into the couch. \"Well, maybe not. There's always some girl getting dumped in those. What else do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foreign films?\" Brittany asked. \"It's harder to be sad about subtitled dialogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sarah smiled, resting one hand on her potbelly. \"You pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, 'Un Heureux \u00c9v\u00e9nement,'\" Brittany said. \"This has pretty good ratings. Let's see how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany started playing the movie and sat beside Sarah, and as the two discovered, the movie featured pregnancy. A lot of pregnancy. Their cheeks got a little red, thinking about Diana and the woman on the screen, wondering what the details behind their own friend's pregnancy were. Then there was Maci and Laci to think about and they pictured a goth and preppy girl with a round, bulging belly like Barbara in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't say anything out loud, but both noted in their minds that the main character's pregnancy shared some...similarities to their own conditions. Cravings, nausea, growing belly. <i>That's impossible, though</i>, they both thought, shaking their heads. Still, Sarah couldn't help but think about her dreams lately, where she, and Brittany and Diana too, were hugely pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movie ended, both turned to each other, giggling nervously. \"Well, that was unexpected,\" Brittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Sarah said, quickly moving her hand from her own belly, convincing herself it was bloating. \"We should really...try to get ahold of Diana tomorrow. Tell her we're supportive and...and whatever else she needs us to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Brittany nodded, getting off the couch. \"Well, a big dinner plus a 10K plus a movie have made me exhausted. See you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\" Sarah said, going to her own room as Brittany undid the connection to the TV. Stripping down, Sarah slid into her bed, lying on her back. The impression of her belly could be seen underneath her bedsheets and she nervously patted the bulge. \"If you really are my pregnant belly...can you crave some healthier foods? Kale, maybe? I'll eat a lot of kale, but no more burgers. You don't want an out-of-shape mom.\" With that, Sarah giggled to herself and closed her eyes. \"Yeah, right, like you could be pregnant, Richardson,\" she said quietly. \"That's impossible for a couple of reasons.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah was jogging slowly, her chest tight as she panted and gasped, sweat pouring down her face. Rebecca ran next to her, slowing down her pace to taunt her co-worker. \"C'mon Sarah, you aren't going to win the fitness competition at that pace. Pick it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair,\" Sarah let out in short bursts. \"You're only carrying twins.\" Rebecca chuckled, stroking her own large belly with one hand as it stayed concealed behind her purple tanktop. Sarah's belly dwarfed Rebecca's, totally exposed and hanging low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later,\" Rebecca grinned. \"Try not to let your water break, Richardson.\" Rebecca went back to her regular pace, running ahead with ease. Sarah kept pushing herself, the comparatively small bellies of the rest of the MegaGym employees, the Hamiltons, the Smiths, Sabrina, even Theresa and Hillary. As Sarah made it to the finish line, she saw Brittany lying on her back, gasping and panting loudly, rubbing her own belly, nearly the size of Sarah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many laps did you manage?\" Sarah asked when she stopped, bending over to hold her belly and take in huge breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-one,\" Brittany said. \"So I guess you're not technically last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sarah said, trying to smile. A bottle of water appeared under her nose and she looked up to see a gorgeous pregnant woman handing it to her. Sarah couldn't make out the woman's details or even recognize her, but she felt a deep sense of calm when she appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you don't need to win. I still love you,\" the woman said, letting Sarah's hand touch hers as she took the water bottle. \"And besides, this is just a dream. You'll do much better in the real thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be there for the real thing?\" Sarah asked, moving closer to the dream woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And I can't wait to meet you...,\" the woman said with a smile, moving her lips to Sarah's, \"today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah woke up in an instant, her eyes darting around her dark apartment room. For someone who just woke up, she felt strangely alert and well-rested. Reaching down, she picked up her phone lying beside her bed and saw the time. One minute before her alarm clock was set to go off. \"On the bright side, I can start my run one minute earlier!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing off her covers and sitting up, Sarah saw that she might need to rethink today's morning run. The potbelly she was carrying around yesterday was now a full-on belly. Round, firm, and big. She could wrap her hands around it and not just rest on top of it and feel bloated and fat. This was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look...pregnant,\" Sarah said out loud, looking down at herself. \"I...I look pregnant.\" Standing up slowly, Sarah could feel the change in weight against her back and hips, rubbing her hugeness. <i>But that's impossible</i>, she then thought, bending over slowly to get her phone. The side effects from Xpect were much worse than she thought. Maybe it was a bad purchase after all. If anyone could help explain this to her, it was Diana. She'd been researching this stuff, and besides, Diana was the smartest person Sarah knew. Even if she didn't know anything about Xpect, she could give Sarah some insight into her swelling middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind eased for now, Sarah squeezed into her jogging clothes, glad the top and shorts had enough elastic to contain her breasts and ass which had grown along with her belly. Taking a deep breath, Sarah headed out the door, her glowing personality not allowing her to think about the leering looks she would get running around with what looked like a six-month pregnant belly hanging out and heaving breasts in a low-cut athletic top. People on the sidewalk either looked at her in disgust, astonishment, or lust. Some people snapped pictures and uploaded them to all different websites with different captions. \"You'll Never Believe How This Girl Decided to Dress.\" \"Fat Pregnant Girl Thinks We All Want To See Her Stomach.\" \"I'm In Love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, being pretty early in the morning, Sarah didn't run into too many people before she got back home. As she came up the steps, she saw the Smiths, walking downstairs, both looking concerned. \"Hi Tami, Andrew,\" Sarah said. Once she got their attention, their faces turned from worry to shock. \"How are you both? Still going to MegaGym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we're going to a doctor's appointment,\" Tami said, looking away, embarrassed, from Sarah's belly. \"I've been feeling a little...odd lately.\" She tried to cross her arms to hide her own growing belly and wasn't doing the best job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope everything turns out okay,\" Sarah said with a sympathetic tone. \"If you don't feel good, maybe best to say away from the gym. Let me know, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded as Sarah went into her apartment, finding Brittany pacing around, wearing her robe with her belly clearly sticking out. \"Sarah...oh my God it's happened to you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed and nodded. \"Yeah, this bloating is getting out of control, but I'm going to talk with Diana and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloating? Sarah, wake up: we're pregnant. Somehow, some way, we're pregnant,\" she said, unfurling her robe to place both hands over her stomach. \"Look at this! This nausea, the exhaustion, the growing all over the place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany, you need to be more reasonable,\" Sarah said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reasonable?! You say unreasonable stuff all the time! All of this health food crap, all of this exercise! It's all nonsense!\" Brittany grabbed a can of Xpect off the table and held it up to Sarah's face. \"You waste money on this crazy garbage because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about!\" After a few moments of silence, the two friends meeting eyes, Brittany started fanning her face, waddling as quickly as she could back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped, rubbing her belly with concern as she waddled to her own room to start on her shower. She and Brittany had fought before but...this felt different. First Diana, now Brittany. Were the Three Musketeers breaking apart? Sarah tried not to think about it right now as she washed herself off, finding herself stroking her belly fairly regularly. <i>I kind of like rubbing it</i>, Sarah thought to herself. <i>That's one upside, I suppose</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed into her usual work attire, Sarah drove herself to the gym, struggling to get the steering wheel to function with her belly in the way. The struggle slowed Sarah down immensely, and once she finally made it to the MegaGym parking lot, it was nearly time for her FemmeFit program to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying inside, having to hold the front of her belly to keep it from slowing her down too much, Sarah checked in quickly and waddled to her area of the gym, when a familiar face stopped her on the way. \"Diana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sarah?\" Diana said, looking down at Sarah's belly. \"I guess I was right,\" Diana said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't hear her friend because she was too busy wrapping her up in a big hug. Possibly the biggest hug she'd ever given, minus the first time Kate said she wanted them to move in together. \"Diana Larsen, I have wanted to give out one of my special hugs to a best friend when they tell me they are either having a baby or getting married, and now I finally get to do one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana laughed a little and hugged Sarah back. \"C-careful,\" Diana managed to get out, both because of their bellies and because Sarah's hugs could sometimes go off the scale of a dynamometer. When Sarah finally broke the hug after nearly a minute, she could see Diana's wardrobe: a pair of black leggings and a bright green spandex top that held in most of her belly. And yes, to Sarah's surprise, Diana now had a sizable belly, which she did not have yesterday. \"You can see that I was telling the truth about being pregnant now, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Sarah said, the two of them resting their hands on their bellies simultaneously. \"Did you get my text and that's why you met me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of,\" Diana said, adjusting her glasses. \"I figured I'd see you here but I also...signed up for pre-natal exercise. I figured I could use it now that I'm...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. \"Well, we need to talk all about it. And about this-\" she said, patting her own belly. \"I'm starting to look like you, Diana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually something I should tell you about quickly,\" Diana said. \"First of all, who else did you give-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I've got my class now and my Pregnant Friend Hug ate up the last bit of time I had left!\" Sarah said, waddling past Diana as she yelled to her. \"But we'll talk after I'm done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Xpect to...\" Diana tried to get out as Sarah went into the main gym area to teach her class. \"Oh boy, she isn't going to like what I have to tell her.\" Diana turned around to see Terry, leaning against the wall with a casual smile on his face, looking her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" he said, trying hard to flex his muscles without looking like he's flexing at all. \"Are you lost? I teach crossfit training here, so I know everything there is to know about MegaGym. I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana noticed his own bulging stomach. It just looked like a paunch for now, but she had a bad feeling. \"I'm looking for...pre-natal exercise, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Terry said, his muscles immediately shrinking as he relaxed. \"Down this hall, second door on the left. Nina runs it, and believe me, you'll be able to recognize her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Diana said, turning to waddle over before turning back to Terry, \"and, um, I'd suggest starting to take iron and calcium supplements soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were a few employees around, but they were distracted with other work. Britney took the opportunity to readjust her shirt, hiding her new belly as best she could. But doing so forced her to roll up her shirt and reveal her bare stomach, even larger and more rounded. Britney sighed as she saw it. At least it was taut and wasn't too lumpy. But in Britney's mind, that didn't help things much either. She didn't look fat; she looked pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brit,\" Darren said, causing Britney to jump. \"Wow, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Britney said, taking a long swig of water from her bottle. \"Just nervous about tonight's show, I guess. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Customers out front want to see what some of the merchandise looks like,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"I've always thought that was a silly gimmick. Aren't we more professional than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lingerie's just that sort of product,\" Britney smiled, walking to the front of the store. \"At least you sell it well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do,\" Darren said with mock pride, heading to his desk. \"I'm going to start putting the finishing touches on tonight's show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney took a deep breath and tried to put on a brave, sexy face for the customers. A man, young and attractive, smiled nervously when Britney  walked up to him. \"Hello there,\" Britney smiled. \"You wanted to see what this piece looked like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's no mannequins around for me to compare it to,\" he said, looking Britney over as he handed her the red lacy underwear. \"You're a bit...bustier than my wife, but you're about her size otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let me just show you what you'd be getting,\" Britney grinned, walking into an \"Employees Only\" changing room and pulling her clothes off, struggling with her pants and underwear thanks to her \"recent\" pregnancy...except it <u>wasn't</u> pregnancy! Britney shook her head, trying to focus on the task at hand. When she was done, she opened the doors, stepping out and popping out one hip while resting her hands against them, bringing attention to the thin, silky bottom and the alluring top that clung to Britney's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband's grin faded into a look of curiosity as his eyes moved away from Britney's breasts to her belly. \"Um...maybe something else would be better. This outfit seems like it would make her look a little...off.\" He reached under his arms for another pair of pink lingerie he had instead. \"Here, try this on please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" Britney winked, trying her best to not \"break character.\" Stripping out of the red lingerie, Britney slipped into the pink outfit instead. On this one, a translucent cloak hung from the bra cutely. But, not so cutely in Britney's opinion, her belly pushed the cloak out, changing in the impact some. \"What do you think about your wife in something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband's confused grin turned to a look of total displeasure when Britney walked out the second time. \"Oh...it's not the lingerie,\" he said to himself, loud enough that Britney could hear. \"Um, I think I'll come back with her some day and try to pick something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds like a good plan,\" Britney said with a fake, sweet smile. \"I'm sure your wife will look good in whatever you-\" Britney's voice trailed off as the man left the store. \"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her shift on the floor went about the same. Women who wanted to see how lingerie looked thought, based on Britney's modeling, that they would look \"fat.\" Husbands and boyfriends couldn't look past Britney's bulge to imagine how it would look on their partners. And dudes who came in because they knew they could get a free look at a hot woman in lingerie were sorely disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough time on the floor?\" Darren said as Britney ate her lunch with a grimace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorta,\" Britney grumbled. \"I didn't make a single sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all have bad days,\" Darren said. \"Tonight will cheer you up. We're about ready to do our last run-through now. Almost all the other models are here now. When you're done with lunch, you can head back with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Britney said, giving Darren a little smile as she scooped a big spoonful of yogurt into her mouth. Why was she craving so much yogurt lately? Looking down at her belly, Britney cautiously wrapped one arm around it. At least now she knew doing more exercising with Sarah wasn't the solution to all of this and she could relax some more. As Britney caressed her growing tummy, she sighed and got out her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Dr. Stevens' office for gynecology,\" the receptionist on the other end said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, I'm Britney Modson and I'm a patient of Dr. Stevens and I'd like to set an appointment for tomorrow,\" Britney said quietly. \"At your earliest time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get you right at 9 in the morning,\" the receptionist replied in a comforting voice. Britney thanked her and hung up, hurrying to the back of the store, designed with a runway and seating on both sides. Britney walked out to find, to her surprise, that she was not the only one with growing problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of the models \u2014 Gisele, Nico, Michelle, and especially Monica \u2014 had clear bellies as they stood on stage in their lingerie. Only Monica was around Britney's size and the other three girls were smaller, but it was still obvious. The models seemed to notice too, as all four were look dejected and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're back,\" Darren said, walking over to Britney. \"I think we should do a full run-through, start to finish, and if we need to do any individual segment over again-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darren...say something to the girls to get their spirits up,\" Britney said quietly to him, motioning to the models. \"They can't...we can't go out like this.\" Britney put her hands on her belly. Darren looked down and rolled his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney, this is crunch time. You can't get self-conscious now. If you want to talk to them, go ahead,\" he said, looking down at his clipboard and walking to the end of the runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney got back on stage and gathered the models together. \"Do any of you know what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele shrugged. \"Nico, Michelle, and I partied a bit last night and we might have gone a little...overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you all still look great,\" Britney said. \"So don't worry. Monica...you're a little harder to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" Monica said, hanging her head, hands nervously rubbing together. Her voice was so quiet, it was barely getting out. \"Stress, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney took Monica aside, one hand on her shoulder. \"Stress over the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...other things,\" Monica said. Britney lifted Monica's chin with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay. See: I'm as big as you,\" Britney said, patting her belly. \"And you look twice as good as me, so you'll have nothing to worry about. When this is over, we can pig out and get these bellies even bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica let out a little laugh and smiled, a blush forming across her freckled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god, honey, you are impossibly cute</i>, Britney thought. <i>Sarah's going to love tonight</i>. \"There's a smile. You're the most professional runway model of...of all five of us. You'll do great, Monica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we all set?\" Darren said, hand just above the play button for the accompanying music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney looked between all four of the women, checking to see if they were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a little sluggish, but I can power through it,\" Michelle said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ankles feel swollen in these heels, but I'll still strut my best strut,\" Nico smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bras felt tight before, but now it's like a vice,\" Gisele said, gripping her breasts a bit. \"But I'll manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica?\" Britney said quietly as Monica was looking off into space, finger cutely against her mocha lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready,\" Monica smiled back weakly. Britney smiled and gave Darren the thumbs-up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"And up! and down! and up! and down!\" Sarah said into her headset, hands on her hips as she lunged down in rhythm with the music, her belly making the trip with her. While Sarah's body was adjusting relatively well to her pregnancy (which she was still in denial about), the rest of the women in Sarah's FemmeFit class were struggling with much smaller, but still very much real, bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" Peggy squeaked out, one hand straightening out her top, clearly not expecting to be as big or as bosomy as she was just yet. \"Do...you...think...we...can...slow...down...some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't lose momentum now!\" Sarah said, still with her booming, enthusiastic trainer's voice. \"And up! and down! and stop! Good job, ladies.\" A chorus of groans went out in response as the women struggled to bend down and get their water bottles. \"Good, everyone get rehydrated before we get into our next set,\" Sarah said, bending over to fiddle with iPod, moving onto the next workout track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheesy 80s sports movie music started to play and Sarah turned around in a flash, bouncing on her toes, letting her increasingly full chest bounce around plenty as well, much to the enjoyment of the gym goers who camped out at the exercise equipment surrounding the stretch of gym Sarah taught her class in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, last one!\" Sarah said, moving her hips more as she started the routine. \"Just follow me: Left! Right! Left! Right!\" Sarah punched her fists out along with her commands and her class followed suit, albeit sluggishly. Sarah, internally, was feeling just as tired and weighed down as her class. Her belly was easily twice as big as the biggest woman in her class and amniotic fluid isn't exactly light. But, her age, her athleticism, and most importantly, her fitness-craving mind made her power through the workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a few quick bouncing steps over to Peggy, whose arms were starting to go limp. \"C'mon Peggy! Quick, quick, quick punches!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...a little...out of it...today,\" Peggy let out in little gasps. But Sarah wasn't letting her go that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great, just follow me and get those arms up,\" Sarah said, her ponytail slapping back and forth as she turned her hips for each punch. \"Pretend you're hitting your ex-husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy let out an exhausted laugh and managed to get her punches back up to code, Sarah cheerfully following her along before hopping back to the center of the area in front of her class. \"And stop! Great workout everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if a hurricane blew over the class the way all the women slumped over as soon as Sarah called it quits. But the workout seemed to bond the women, as they were hugging and laughing as they toweled off and got water. Sarah couldn't have been prouder. The whole point of FemmeFit was about female empowerment, not just exercise. And pushing everyone when they feel their worst is just part of the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah was putting up her things, Peggy walked up to Sarah, tapping her nervously on the shoulder. \"Great job today, Peggy!\" Sarah grinned, patting her mid-30s student on the shoulder. Peggy's belly was the largest in the class and Sarah was about to find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Sarah,\" Peggy said. \"I just wanted to tell you...this will be my last class with you for a while.\" Sarah frowned and Peggy cut her off before she could respond. \"Not because I don't think you're a great instructor! It's just that I'm...joining Nina's class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gasped, putting her hands over her mouth. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy nodded, slowly putting a hand on her belly. \"I'm pregnant...found out this morning. Four months with triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets,\" Sarah said, eyes opening up wide. \"Is it...are they...his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Peggy sighed, looking down at her belly. \"One of the few things we never argued about was kids. We both knew we didn't want any. Kind of ironic, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peggy, you are going to be a fantastic mother and your children will grow up to be president,\" Sarah said in a all-too-earnest-and-heartfelt voice. \"All three of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Peggy said, hesitating before hugging Sarah tightly. \"And thank you for...for FemmeFit. You helped me through a dark period in my life and I...\" Sarah could feel tears on her shoulder, although they might be more beads of sweat. It wasn't too clear at first, but when they broke the hug, Peggy was wiping her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come see me anytime,\" Sarah smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. And maybe I'll see you in Nina's class soon,\" Peggy said, looking down at Sarah's belly before turning around to head to the lockers. Sarah furrowed her lips and eyebrow, wondering if Peggy thought Sarah was pregnant too. Not that she could blame her for making the mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me,\" Theresa said, waiting nearby for when Peggy left. \"Do you...have a minute, Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have all the minutes for you, Theresa,\" Sarah grinned, hoisting her bag over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be in class for a few months. I'm...I don't know how to say this...\" Theresa said, face turning pale as she looked down sheepishly. Sarah's eyes bugged out. <i>Don't tell me</i>... \"I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...huh,\" Sarah said. She wanted to be excited for her friend but Theresa was in her 60s. There was a conflict going on in Sarah's brain between her logic and her emotions, the level of which Sarah had never experienced before. \"You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive as an ultrasound can be,\" Theresa said. \"Four months with twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Four months again. Weird coincidence</i>. \"How do you feel about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrified. Confused. A little angry,\" Theresa said. \"This is impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, women have been pregnant in their 60s before,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, it's really impossible. You and I are...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at her with confusion again. \"Are...friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesbians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cocked her head. \"You never told me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told me either. It's called gaydar,\" Theresa said, rolling her eyes. \"We figured this sort of stuff out in the 70s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why can everyone else do that except me</i>? Sarah pouted internally. \"Well...I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of it. Let me know if you ever need any help, okay Theresa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'll let you know,\" Theresa sighed. \"You're one of the most impressive women I know. You'll be a much better mother to your kids than I'll be to mine.\" Theresa headed off to the lockers, leaving Sarah to pout again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not pregnant,\" she complained to herself, attempting to march to the other areas of the gym until discovering that a waddle was more called for. \"I'm just...I don't know. But I can't be pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah left the main gym and headed down the hallway, passing by two minor gym employees hanging a big banner next to the banner advertising the competition at MegaGym in a few days. The new banner highlighted the fact that the event was sponsored by Xpect. The mysterious brown-haired woman from the commercial was smiling subtly on the right side of the poster, cursive words next to her lips reading \"Fills you with life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah entered another workout room in the gym, the sign for \"Pregercize\" written on a dry-erase board greeting her as she walked inside. Sarah could see Diana, her strawberry hair tied up in a bun as she moved around, giving Sarah an ample view of her rear. Sarah bit her lip. Who could have blamed her for hitting on Sarah that day at the pub so many years ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, what drew Sarah's attention wasn't Diana, but Nina. She'd been pretty close to delivery when Sarah saw her three days ago and gave her a can of Xpect, but now...Nina was huge. Her bronze belly was out, totally bare, as an elastic athletic top clung to her enlarged breasts. Her belly was the size of a deluxe yoga ball and had the same perfect roundness. It didn't seem to slow Nina down much as she moved around in the small space she'd given herself, with Diana and the other expectant students moving along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And break,\" Nina said, breathing long and steady as she toweled off her forehead. \"Good job, everyone. Remember to get some stretches in later tonight at home. Very important at any stage of pregnancy.\" As the class began to disperse, Sarah walked over to Nina, getting a smile from her friend. \"Sarah, hi!\" The size of Nina's belly prevented her from seeing how large Sarah's had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nina,\" Sarah said slowly, looking her friend over. \"You're...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five babies,\" Nina said, rolling her eyes, rubbing her belly. \"Two days ago the doctor said it was three. Crazy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sarah said. Somehow, the sudden growth in Nina reminded her of...well, of herself. \"But the class looks bigger. That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's a lifesaver,\" Nina said. \"These five are going to need that extra cash. At least I hope it's just five.\" Nina looked up from her belly at the rest of the class. \"Some of your FemmeFit ladies look like they're going to join me soon too. Megan's already here. She said she's expecting quadruplets, can you believe it? A girl that skinny, she'll look like she swallowed a watermelon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Sarah said, feeling a strange sensation inside her own belly. \"Listen, I'll talk to you later, okay Nina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Nina smiled, taking a long sip of water as Sarah went over to Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, good class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as good as yours, but Nina's great,\" Diana said, putting her glasses back on. \"Did you...give her that Xpect stuff, by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" Sarah said. Diana let out a long sigh and put one hand on Sarah's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, is there someplace quiet and private we can talk? I've got...a lot to tell you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms. Perkins was alone in her apartment, staring at her round middle in the mirror. Her belly, now known to her as her PREGNANT BELLY, was rounding out, taking a ball shape. Her once loose skin had tightened up around her belly, the faint beginnings of stretch marks beginning to make their presence. Her back had a small arch to her as her center of gravity changed as her two twin girls grew inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, perhaps in this case, Ms. Perkins wasn't alone. She wouldn't ever really be alone ever again\u2026 And that terrified the hell out of Ms. Perkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was 54 years old, was pregnant with twins girls that she had no idea how they got there, let alone how she could be fertile well past her prime. Xpect however, which Ms. Perkins had consumed 4 days earlier, decided that the rules of pregnancy no longer need to apply to reality, it was of course magical and slightly infused with the chaotic essence of dark pregnancy obsessed deity, which did give it that slightly \"tangy\" aftertaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Hillary, what the hell are you going to do now?\" She asked her pregnant reflection in the mirror, hoping it would answer her back. It didn't, it only reflected the fact that Ms. Perkins had placed two hands into the small of her back and tried to push out her growing pregnant belly further as a way to try to see how she would look when she was truly and massively pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been one hell of a crazy day for her to put it mildly. After another confusing dream about being massively pregnant, she got up and noticed that she was much bigger than the day before. The words \"pregnant\" crossed her mind several times, but logic seemed to dictate that was impossible, given a number of reasons, but Ms. Hillary Perkins no longer lived in a world where logic meant anything when a pregnancy inducing energy drink tainted with the essence of a chaotic dark deity was making the rounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a larger than usual breakfast, and concerned that she might in fact be what could be the impossible, she managed to catch the bus at a local clinic, where the doctor, shockingly confirmed what should be impossible. Giving her a prescription for pre-natal vitamins, a recommendation for lots of safe exercise, a copy of her sonogram, and the news that she was having TWIN girls, the doctor left her along with her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride home was a blur to her, but she seemed to remember her hand resting against the small potbelly she was forming, hoping to feel something, anything that would make this whole thing seem that much more real. She took her vitamins when she got back to her apartment and spent a long amount of time just staring at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan of hunger from her stomach, and a sudden craving for pizza gave Ms. Perkins that answer she was looking for, at least temporarily. \"Well, I should at least get something to eat.\" She picked up the phone and dialed out, ordering one, no, make that two pizzas, with anchovies, mushrooms, and peppers, along with extra cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you two are going to make me huge\" She said, looking down at her belly. She wasn't sure what to do next. She was 54, 54! While she had a decent amount of money in the bank, it wasn't exactly going to send two kids to college. Forget about college, what about 10 years from now! 64 years and dealing with preteens! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the couch, crunching numbers in her head, becoming more and more concerned about the two unexpected guests inside of her. She was alone, and she didn't want to be alone. <i>It's only been a day</i> Ms. Perkins thought to herself, but she needed to talk to her. <br>\r\nShe picked up her cellphone and dialed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa picked up the other end. \"Hello?\" Theresa said, out of breath from her work-out with Sarah just a few minutes earlier. <br>\r\n\"It's me.\" Ms. Perkins said. <br>\r\n\"I thought the rule was you're supposed to wait three days to call after a date\" Theresa said back slyly.<br>\r\n\"I know but.. Do you think you could head over? I really, really need to talk to you\" Ms. Perkins said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Perkins and Theresa had only been on one date, but it was magical. Sure they had talked on the chat rooms for months before working up the nerve to meet face to face, but that wasn't exactly going hot-and-heavy. Still, Ms. Perkins felt she had a connection that was more than just purely sexual, and she needed to talk to someone right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hillary I..\" Theresa was going to say something but Ms. Perkins interrupted. <br>\r\n\"Please, just come on over. Free food at least. We need to talk\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we do\" Theresa said, feeling her own pregnant belly in the locker room of the gym. <br>\r\n\"See you soon?\" Ms. Perkins asked. <br>\r\n\"Whenever I can.\" Theresa responded back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to break her heart that she was going to have to break up with Theresa, but realistically what could she expect? Was Theresa going to want to continue dating a 54 year old pregnant lesbian when she ballooned up the size of a house? This was for the best. Let her off easy before things got to crazy. She had.. a family to think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her belly a pat, she went into her bedroom and grabbed the SnapPix digital camera that Sarah had given her one year for Christmas. It was a simple point-and-shoot camera, \"something any idiot could use\" Sarah said to her, not realizing the lack of social tact. Stripping down to only her under wear, she placed one hand across her breasts, shocked at how firm and sensitive they were getting, and walked over to her full length mirror and started taking pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like this is probably going to ever happen again\" She said, taking dozens upon dozens of pictures of her pregnant self \"So might as well do the whole experience\". She then switched the camera to record video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Girls, I guess this is Mommy. I'm not really sure about this whole thing\" She said to herself, recording every inch of her pregnant body unto the memory card of the camera. \"I'm 54 years old, and I'm four months pregnant with you. I'm recording this so that when you're older you'll understand this whole crazy situation\" Ms. Perkins went on like this, recording herself, taking video of the sonogram, documenting her whole unusual pregnancy in video and photos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time had passed, she changed over into a nightgown, that was starting to get alarmingly snug in the middle, and did very little to conceal her pregnant-ness. There was a knock on the door, and she opened to receive her pizzas. She paid for the pizzas, while the delivery boy made a snide comment \"You sure look like you have an appetite ma'am\". \"It's not for me, I'm pregnant\" She said, revealing her belly to the man, confusing him greatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paid for her pizzas, (and stiffed the delivery boy his tip after his little \"comment) and sat down to devour her meal, when she realized that she wait for Theresa. <br>\r\nShe did not have to wait for long as few moments later Theresa came knocking at her door. Gathering up her courage, Ms. Perkins meet her at the door. <br>\r\n\"Hello\" Theresa said. She was wearing an extra large baggy rain-coat which was unusual giving the somewhat slinky dress she had worn the night before.<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Ms. Perkins said in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Perkins waved Theresa inside who took a seat at the table. \"Pizza?\" Theresa asked. Theresa had a lot on her mind right now given her pregnancy, and while she too had a craving for pizza, she just came from a workout.. Still pregnant women needed to eat\u2026 <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had such a craving\" Ms. Perkins said, a hand absentmindedly making a way to her middle, luckily for her, Theresa didn't see it. <br>\r\n\"I kind of had a craving too\" Theresa said, opening the box and inhaling the aroma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, look\" Ms. Perkins said, taking a seat at the table. This was it. It wasn't going to be easy.<br>\r\n\"There's something I need to tell you\" Theresa said, picking at her pizza. <br>\r\n\"Me too\". Ms Perkins said.<br>\r\n\"You first.\" <br>\r\n\"No you\".<br>\r\n\"Let's just say it at the same time\" Ms. Perkins suggested.<br>\r\nA pause. <br>\r\n\"I'm Pregnant\" \"I'm Pregnant\" they both said in unison. <br>\r\n\"Wait?! You're what?!\" They also both said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLegit shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be pregnant?\" Theresa asked, undoing her coat to reveal the belly sticking out from under her clothes.<br>\r\n\"I don't know! How can you be pregnant!\" Ms. Perkins asked, unveiling her belly behind her bathrobe. <br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Theresa responded. <br>\r\n\"Well, this is awkward. And to think I was going to break up with you because of these two!\" Ms. Perkins said with a smile, placing a hand on her bare-belly.<br>\r\n\"Wait! You were going to break up with me? And you're having TWINS?\" Theresa asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, it just wouldn't work out I thought. You wouldn't want to be with an old pregnant woman\" <br>\r\n\"I was going to break up with you because I was pregnant with twins as well. I thought YOU wouldn't want to be with an old pregnant woman\" Theresa said laughing. <br>\r\n\"So boy or girl?\" Ms. Perkins asked. <br>\r\n\"Twins boys\" Theresa said.<br>\r\n\"Twin girls\" Ms. Perkins said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed and Ms. Perkins and Theresa continued to talk to each, pregnant 54 year old to pregnant 54 year old, expressing their fears and concerns. After both pizzas had been devoured, Theresa pat her belly and gave a smile. \"Well I should go, it's a long drive back to my apartment with this thing in way\"<br>\r\n\"Stay the night here. My bed is small, but it should probably hold the two of us\" Ms. Perkins said.<br>\r\n\"It sounds like you're seducing me Ms. Perkins\" Theresa said. \"What will the neighbors think? Two old pregnant women sharing the night together in the same bed?\" <br>\r\n\"This is the 21st century. Smart phones, internet streaming, old pregnant lesbians. Anything is possible. Besides, if it bothers you that much, maybe we should just get married before we share a bed. Do it the old fashioned way!\" Ms. Perkins joked. <br>\r\n\"Okay\" Theresa said without hesitation.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ms. Perkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get married.\" </span></div></div>",

Maci sat with her head resting on her mother's quickly growing belly, concerned that she woke up much bigger than the other day. \"It will be okay\" Trisha said, running her fingers through her daughter's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other daughter, Laci, sat across from them, wearing what was basically a pair of black cargo pants, a spike studded leather belt, and what was basically a frilly basic bra, and nothing else, leaving her pale white dome visible to the whole world. She laid on her back, massaging her belly, while a pair of headphones blared loud metal music onto her baby-filled dome. Her face was made pale with make-up, her bright black lips wrapped in a twisted smile as she thought of all the possibilities of her quickly growing spawns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop crying Maci. Enjoy this. I've got a date later for a goth-themed pregnancy shoot. We're going for a Rosemary's Baby theme\" Laci said.<br>\r\n\"Enough Laci, and for god's sake put a shirt on. Everyone can see your.. everything\" Dave said, pacing back, a hand placed in the small of his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes were tight against his stomach, giving Dave the appearance that he might also be pregnant.. Which he was.. Very much so. <br>\r\nHe was frustrated.

I don't want you to go into labor just yet\" Laci teased at her father. <br>\r\nLaci's nonshalent attitude about her pregnancy was getting on his nerves.

And everything looks healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets,\" Laci chuckled. \"Lucky you. I'm hoping for at least that many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci,\" Dave growled, putting a firm hand on his daughter's shoulder. \"Please try and behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who's first?\" the nurse said, adjusting a few buttons on the ultrasound machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me,\" Laci and Maci said in unison, looking at each other with an annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to go first?\" Laci sneered. \"You're all broken up about being the only bimbo with a belly down at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want an ultrasound to prove that none of this is real,\" Maci said, hand firmly against her own small but growing belly. In stark contrast to her sister, Maci wore a long top with a thick sweater overtop, complete with a pair of jeans she'd normally find unflatteringly baggy. Her platinum blond hair was also brushed differently to give her bangs, in hopes to further conceal her identity on the off-chance anyone noticed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a funny sort of way, the twin sisters had changed their wardrobes to mirror the others during the course of their pregnancy. Maci, who once let her cleavage hang up and tried to find the shortest skirts possible was bundling up, and Laci, constantly shrouded in fear of getting any sun, was more exposed than even Maci would on a regular day. Maci started doing her hair more and more to hide her face and added more make-up to hide her fear. Her face was a glimmering spectacle of coral lip gloss and tan concealer. Laci, on the other hand, always had her hair in her face like a ghoul, but now styled it to give her a shocking, vampire-queen look and was putting on more black lipstick and white body makeup than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, please,\" Trisha groaned, gripping between her eyebrows. \"Maci, you go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two argue over everything,\" Dave said, shaking his head. \"I never thought I'd have to separate you both arguing over who gets their ultrasound first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roll up your shirt, please,\" the nurse smiled, applying gel to Maci's bulge. \"It's a little cold, but it doesn't hurt.\" Maci nodded and looked at the ceiling, biting her lip as the deep \"gulg, gulg\" sound of the machine purred along. \"There we go, I've got a good image here. And it looks like twins,\" the nurse said, turning to the mother. \"I guess I don't need to ask if there's a history of twins in the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twins,\" Maci said, shaking her head back and forth. \"Great. Just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything looks healthy,\" the nurse said, hesitating slightly. \"But they look pretty far along. I'd say...21 weeks or so. This is your first appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know I was pregnant until two days ago,\" Maci said, her voice desparate, as she looked between her parents and the nurse. The nurse waved Dave and Trisha aside to talk in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are seeing cases of pregnancies developing rapidly,\" she said. \"I can speak from...personal experience on this as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Trisha said, hand on her belly. \"Maci \u2014 everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever,\" Laci said, rolling her eyes. \"Don't remind me that Maci got the demon babies in her too. Rapid gestation is part of the lore. Everyone knows it.\" She hopped onto the table as soon as Maci stepped down, hands tracing her belly with glee. \"Alright, let's see how many I've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse ran the gel and wand over Laci's belly, smearing her body make-up and revealing some of her own naturally glowing, tan belly skin. \"Looks like you're just like your sister: twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Laci said. Maci broke out in tears and rested her head against Trisha's shoulders, her mother shushing her and petting her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they're also four months along,\" the nurse smiled at Laci. \"And they look pretty healthy and human to me. No demons, no monsters, no aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a let down,\" Laci sighed, rubbing the underside of her belly. \"I guess two's better than one at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure,\" Trisha chuckled, giving Maci a kiss on the head before making her way to the examination table. She rolled her shirt up as well and let the nurse apply the wand as Dave's cellphone buzzed. He checked the text he got and turned pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just be out for a few seconds,\" he said, darting out before Trisha had a chance to say it was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not looking forward to being a dad again?\" the nurse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just been busy lately,\" Trisha sighed, looking at her daughters. \"And you two don't exactly make things easy for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're blaming us for this?\" Laci cackled, putting both hands around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Trisha smiled, rolling her eyes. \"You're both just very...expressive. I can't imagine how your father would react if this time around, I'm having-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twins,\" the nurse said, cutting her off and turning the screen to Trisha. \"Looks like it's a family trait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it,\" Trisha gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave walked around the hallway, looking around as Tami Smith tapped him on the shoulder, her face bright red. Dave opened his mouth but Tami held up her trembling hand. \"Save it,\" she said. \"I don't have a lot of time. I have my ultrasound appointment in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's...\" Dave said, voice trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure. Andrew uses condoms. You didn't,\" Tami said. \"I can't believe I did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanted to get a house so badly. I didn't force you into anything,\" Dave said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a pig,\" Tami said. \"You knew I didn't have the money or the credit to get to see a good realtor and you knew you had connections to let us see one. All I had to do was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Andrew know?\" Dave gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll have to know eventually, because this is your baby and you're paying for it...or them. I'm getting big awfully fast,\" Tami said, lifting up her shirt to reveal her bulge. \"Right now, he's getting an ultrasound of his own. Turns out some men are turning up pregnant in town.\" Tami looked down at Dave's midsection. \"I'd get one too if I were you. You were always chubby, but not that chubby.\" Tami turned around and hustled back down the hall to her appointment room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave walked into his family's examination room as Trisha was wiping gel off her belly. \"Everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine,\" Dave smiled weakly. \"But I think I might...need an ultrasound too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh, that feels so good,\" Nina moaned as she lowered herself into the pool, the water only coming halfway up her enormous pregnant belly. \"It's nice to feel a little weightless once a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet,\" Lori said, leaning against the side of the pool, drinking from her water bottle. \"I prefer swimming laps to relax, but walking around in the shallow end is always calming. I'm surprised you don't hold more of your pregnancy fitness classes in the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have to,\" Emily sighed, leaning on Nina's other side. Her long curly hair was tied up and stuffed under a swim cap to prevent any from getting in the pool. The gym's manager had to set a good example, after all. \"More and more pregnant women are signing up for specialty classes. Lori, do you think that's something you could tackle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why me?\" Lori said, a little edgy thanks to her own growing bulge. Despite it, Lori still wore her black two-piece athletic bathing suit and with her tight abs, the size of her pregnant belly was disguised some. She hadn't been to the doctor yet or taken a pregnancy test, but whenever she looked at her belly in the mirror, especially today, only one thought came to her mind: I look pregnant. She'd also been having bizarre dreams about being pregnant, surrounded by her other children. Lori never felt any desire to have babies before, but was this subconscious or...was she actually expecting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got more experience when it comes to aqua aerobics,\" Emily said, hand moving to her own growing bump, visible under her one-piece bathing suit. \"And Nina...no offense, but you look like if you sneezed, you'd go into labor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel that way too,\" Nina laughed, running her hands over her wet, smooth belly. All she could fit into anymore was a bikini, which also gave anyone passing by a good look at her growing chest. \"I should have a month left but...five babies. The doctors are totally confused. I just hope they'll let me stay out of the hospital for the fitness competition. I'd rather be there than in some lab with people poking and prodding my belly for answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not worried by the time of the contest, you'll have even more babies in there?\" Lori said, raising her eyebrows. \"I know I'd be way more concerned in your shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina shrugged. \"I can't imagine they'll find <i>another</i> fetus in there tomorrow. That'd just be ridiculous. Besides...\" Nina blushed and looked down at her belly. \"I've always wanted a lot of kids. Might as well get it over with all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Employee meeting and we weren't invited?\" Jim laughed, sitting on the edge of the pool, running a towel over his face and shoulders. Terry wasn't far behind, sitting next to Emily, tight tank top still on. Terry was more embarrassed by his growing bulge than Jim. It was bigger, after all, since he was expecting twins and Jim was pregnant with just one. Not that either of them knew yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Emily,\" Terry said, trying to sound nonchalant. \"Got any other model friends you wouldn't mind introducing me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subtle,\" Emily scoffed. \"Sorry, just Monica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" Terry chuckled, his grin growing. \"So? How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily leaned in with a sarcastic smile. \"You're not exactly what she's looking for,\" she said, flashing Terry a big wink. \"Get me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you all gossiping about over there?\" Lori complained, craning her neck. \"Nina, I love you, but your belly can really get in the way, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Nina said, rubbing her belly slowly and gently as she took a few steps away from the pool's ledge, turning to face her coworkers. \"But it sounds like you and Emily hung out yesterday without us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was there,\" Jim chuckled. \"Terry and I ran into Emily by accident. And her very attractive friend. Speaking of which, Emily, do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't and Monica is gay,\" Jim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Jim said, laughing as he drank from his own bottle, filled with tea. It helped him to drink something with an aroma after his yoga classes. Plus, it gave him an air of \"credibility\" for the more intense yoga fans at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to meet Emily's hot friends,\" Lori pouted. \"Although my acting class went well yesterday. I'm working on a little play with another woman in it and I ran into Nina afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you'd all stop talking about Monica like that,\" Emily said, crossing her arms. \"Yes, she's a lingerie model, but she's a brilliant, sensitive girl too and she just went through a brutal break-up and flirting with her is only going to make her more uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bad break-up?\" Nina said. \"She should talk to Sarah. I only know a little bit of her infamous break-up before coming here, but it sounds like it devastated her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like Monica's,\" Emily sighed. \"I swear, if I ever meet her ex Kate, I'm going to need one of you to hold me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate?\" Jim said. \"Weird coincidence. That was Sarah's ex's name, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" Nina said. \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love gossip,\" Jim shrugged with a smile. \"You don't think...Sarah and Monica's ex are the same person, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I never met Sarah's Kate,\" Nina said. \"That'd be something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe getting Sarah and Monica to meet wouldn't be a good idea,\" Lori said. \"Or...could be the best thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone's breaking up and being matched up except me,\" Terry sighed, chin in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the gym's locker room, women were looking at the shower area with wide eyes and gasps, moving away as quickly as they could. Inside, behind the drawn curtain, Tony had Rebecca up against the wall, the two going to town on one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure...this is a good idea?\" Tony panted, gripping Rebecca's thighs to support her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work here, remember? We can do what we want,\" Rebecca hissed, running her nails down Tony's back, pressing her swollen breasts against his face. \"My nausea is finally gone and I'm not letting any time go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe...I was thinking...\" Tony tried to say, his mind fading as Rebecca tried to speed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think, sweetie, you're not too good at it,\" Rebecca giggled, getting ready to come. \"Wait...wait...do you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\" Tony groaned as Rebecca turned her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the lockers behind us, it sounds like some woman and...Sarah!\" Rebecca said. \"They're talking about something...that stupid energy drink...oh...oh! Oh no!\" Rebecca gripped Tony immediately, jolting him into coming as the two slowly slid down onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what was it?\" Tony panted, turning on the shower to cool himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm pregnant,\" Rebecca said, moving a cautious hand to her modest belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but I used a condom,\" Tony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I mean,\" Rebecca said. \"I think I've got some news to share with Emily.\"</span></div></div>",

Its size had always made Sarah suspicious, but she kept telling herself it wasn't real. It wasn't possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant?\" Sarah said, turning to Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both are,\" Diana sighed. \"And my guess is Britney is too. And whoever else drank Xpect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah kept looking at her belly, the weight of the situation hitting her. She was pregnant. And she looked pretty far along too. Sarah had never thought too deeply about the possibilities of having children. It wasn't like she needed birth control or had sexual partners who needed to make sure their condoms were on securely. The only time she talked about having a baby was when she was together with Kate. They hadn't even settled on who would carry the child, but Sarah always assumed it would be her. Kate was always busy and told Sarah she had more of a bubbly, \"mommy\" personality. But in the end, Sarah had no Kate, no girlfriend to speak of, but was now having the baby they'd talked about. Or babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" Diana said again, putting her hand on Sarah's shoulder. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you reacted when you found out,\" Sarah said, turning to Diana, shaking slightly. \"But I am not handling this news very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana sighed and smiled, putting her hand on Sarah's belly. \"Hey, hey. It'll be fine. We're in this together. We were the three muskateers, remember? If we all put our heads together, we can raise our weird, energy drink babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gave a little smile and put her hand on Diana's belly. \"Yeah...I guess Britney and I will be seeing a lot more of you. At the park, at daycare, at the baby gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think babies go to the g-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby aerobics, baby core conditioning, baby yoga,\" Sarah said, her eyes starting to widen. \"Oh, this could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana smiled and shook her head, letting Sarah find a positive angle wherever she could. \"Right. We'll be able to support one another. But it'll still have its challenges. Some of my coworkers at the lab have kids of their own and they're a lot of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah Richardson never shies away from hard work,\" Sarah said, puffing out her chest. \"You can teach our babies to be science geniuses and I'll teach them physical fitness and positive thinking. Britney can be the one to discipline them, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we're not trying to set up some kind of polygamist child-rearing relationship,\" Diana said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, this is just a little stressful on my brain,\" Sarah sighed, rubbing Diana's belly in rhythm with her own. \"I should take this one step at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like visiting a doctor?\" Diana said. \"I made an appointment for myself today. First ultrasound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First ultrasound,\" Sarah sighed, looking down at herself. \"I always thought I'd have someone beside me when I saw my baby in my belly for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana patted Sarah's belly gently. \"I'll be there. And Britney too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, but the way I saw it, we'd also make out and make the doctor leave the room so we could do it on the examining table,\" Sarah said. \"I don't think your or Britney would be open to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess not,\" Diana said. \"That's a very specific fantasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like those weird, angular examining tables,\" Sarah said, blushing. \"All bendy and...cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think you're doing better,\" Diana smiled, lifting herself off of the locker room's bench, wrapping an arm around Sarah's back to help her up as well. \"We'll talk later today. I've got to get to my appointment and you've got to get ready for Britney's show today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney's show,\" Sarah moaned, lifting up her athletic top and looking at her bare belly. \"She's going to be walking around in lingerie while she's pregnant. I'd die of embarrassment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>You'd</u> die of embarrassment? I didn't think you were capable of that emotion,\" Diana said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I asked you out the first time we met, I wanted to climb under a rock,\" Sarah sighed, her lip wobbling before she wrapped Diana up in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Diana said, patting Sarah on the back gently. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so, so scared of what's going to happen next,\" Sarah whimpered. \"But I get to be pregnant at the same time as my two favorite friends in the whole world, and right now, that makes me so happy you can't believe it.\" Sarah looked back at Diana, tears in both of their eyes. \"Thank you for being my friend all these years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" Diana said, lifting her glasses to wipe her own tears away. \"You too, Sarah. Now let's get outta here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stormed into Emily's office, grabbing a can of Xpect off of the desk in the office's corner. \"What do you know about this stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect?\" Emily said, not looking up from her computer. \"It's a gross drink that's paying us to put their name on our fitness competition. What else is there to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can think of something pretty goddamn important,\" Rebecca said. \"It's the reason you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stopped what she was doing and looked at Rebecca. \"Do you want to repeat that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant,\" Rebecca said. \"I'm pregnant. Lori's pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Rebecca, we might be a little bloated, but that's just part of getting older,\" Emily sighed. \"Even if we exercise as much as we do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious!\" Rebecca said, lifting her shirt. \"Look: that is not fat. That's baby. Maybe more than one. Same goes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, calm down!\" Emily said. \"I don't know how things are going between you and your boyfriend or how things are going for Lori, but I don't need you to pry into my private life and tell me <b>I'm</b> pregnant. I can look after myself and I know I'm not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone who drinks Xpect gets pregnant,\" Rebecca said. \"It's right there on the stupid label. 'Xpect fills you with life.' How could we be so blind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now you really sound crazy,\" Emily said, standing up. \"It's a gross soda. It's not going to make anyone pregnant just by drinking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah and her friend say it does,\" Rebecca said. \"And she's the one who got us our contacts with this...Yaral Industries to make Xpect sponsor our event. It would explain Sarah's belly, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think you've been doing too much exercise with not enough water,\" Emily said. \"I'm sending you home for the day. When you get back, I don't want to hear any of this nonsense, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca left in the huff, taking the can of Xpect with her. Emily sighed and sat down, her belly bumping against the desk. She paused and pressed her hand against her bulge. Slowly, Emily reached for her cellphone. \"Hello...Dr. Harper's office...hi, my name's Emily Turner and I'd like to set up an appointment for...tomorrow's the best you can do? Alright, that's fine, thank you.\" She slumped in her seat and stared at the computer in silence for a few minutes. \"It's impossible,\" she muttered, finally getting back to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to go with you?\" Sarah said as she walked through the parking lot with Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd rather go alone,\" Diana said with a little smile. \"You'd probably better see Britney and tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Sarah sighed. \"But you'll be there when I...and Britney...get our ultrasounds, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't miss it,\" Diana laughed as she heaved herself into her car. \"I'll need to start carpooling with a friend with a smaller belly.\" As she started up the car, Diana rolled down her window and faced Sarah. \"Now, I need you to make me a list of everyone you gave Xpect to, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone?\" Sarah said, going over all the names in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it wasn't a lot, was it?\" Diana asked. \"I mean, I only had a little, but it tasted like shit. You can't have given it to a lot of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Sarah smiled and nodded, turning pale. \"Just a few. I'll get you a list soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because they need to be informed as soon as possible,\" Diana said. \"It's only fair to them.\" Diana pulled out and headed for the hospital as Sarah looked down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair,\" Sarah scoffed, patting her bulge. \"Nothing fair about this...not that I'm mad at you, li'l fella. Or fellas. I guess it's better that you showed up in my tummy now instead of when Kate left.\" With that, Sarah got into her own car and headed to Britney's work, ready to bring the same bad news Diana brought her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana Larsen,\" Diana said, looking around the rest of the doctor's office. She was not the only pregnant patient there and she certainly wasn't the biggest. Some women had colossal bellies resting on their laps, rubbing them cautiously as they looked over pregnancy and baby pamphlets. Some were only slightly paunchy in the middle, but kept their hands over their midsection for dear life. Diana also spotted a few men with bloated midsections too. \"Anything's possible,\" she murmured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" the receptionist said, looking past her glasses as Diana. Diana blushed and gave a nervous smile and a sorry. \"Fill out this form and have a seat. We're very busy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's going to get worse in the next few days,\" Diana said, taking the clipboard and moving to a seat beside a woman who could barely fit in her seat because of her pregnant belly. The woman, a middle-aged woman with almond skin, left most of her belly exposed and was rubbing it slowly. She turned to Diana and gave a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First appointment?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, first pregnancy too,\" Diana smiled back, putting one hand on her belly while she looked over her form. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First one, but I've been to the doctor twice before in the last few days,\" the woman said, rolling her sweater up a few inches to reveal even more of her belly. \"I never thought I could have children, but suddenly, I swelled up. The doctor says it's quadruplets.\" She turned to Diana, laughing a little at the shocked expression on her face. \"I felt the same way. And by their estimates, I'm probably full-term right now. Nine months pregnant. It's amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly is,\" Diana breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far along are you?\" the woman asked, looking past her own humungous belly, reaching out nearly as far as her arms, to look at Diana's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Diana said, thinking it over. \"I think...four months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're anything like me, you'll be a lot bigger soon,\" the woman sighed as her name was called. She slowly heaved herself out of the chair, getting help from Diana and a man sitting next to her. They both took an arm and lifted her up and she rubbed her bare belly quickly when she was back on her feet. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Diana said, trying to bring her attention back to her form but was too distracted thinking about her pregnancy. If one day was one month, then she was only four months along. But one look at Diana and you'd think she was much, much further along. Diana had the ripe fullness of a woman full term with her first bouncing baby boy. Diana hadn't thought about the possibilities of multiples, but if that woman could have quadruplets, who's to say Diana couldn't have more than one too? Given how big she was already, it was...definitely possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana?\" a nurse called. Diana raised her hand and waddled over, handing her completed form back to the receptionist. Most of it wasn't filled out, but Diana was a high-ranking scientist at Tritonic. They did plenty of work with the local hospitals and Diana knew they could get whatever information they wanted later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Sarah said, the examination room was cold and sterile, with a clumsy angular chair for Diana to sit and lean back in. As she sat, staring at the ceiling, a nurse walked in. She was a young Asian woman with a long ponytail and a big smile. \"Hello, Diana? I'm Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Diana smiled, feeling the chair recline even more, forcing Diana to look over her breasts to see her nurse at all. Her belly wasn't the only part of her body that had gotten bigger over the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be doing the initial ultrasound before the doctor comes in. She's been very busy today,\" Jackie said, turning on the ultrasound machine. \"If you'd roll up your shirt, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana did as she asked, taking the light material of her athletic top and revealing her entire, round belly. Jackie paused when saw it, her smile shrinking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your chart said you think you're about four months along?\" Jackie said, raising an eyebrow as she squirted some gel on Diana's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I think so,\" Diana said, giving a little \"eep\" at the cold gel and ultrasound wand. \"I don't...exactly know how this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your last sexual experience was over a year ago, you said,\" Jackie hummed, looking between the chart and the screen. \"Sometimes these things can sneak up on women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not the only one you've heard this happen to?\" Diana asked. Jackie's lips pursed a bit. It was clear that she wasn't supposed to talk too much about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go; some clear images are developing on the screen,\" Jackie said. \"Yes, looks like...I'd say...17 weeks along, though it's hard to tell with all of this...\" Jackie's voice trailed off as she continued to study the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all the what?\" Diana said, not able to see the screen from where she was lying. Although it was cold, Diana found the ultrasound wand oddly soothing. She wished she could feel someone else rub her belly for once. The machine also gave a low, rhythmic sound, which she assumed was the fetal heartbeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you're expecting more than one baby,\" Jackie said. \"A...lot more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana went a bit pale. \"How...many more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Diana heard the worst response to that question. \"I'm still counting.\" That was not a good sign. If it was \"three\" or \"four\" or \"five,\" that would be scary enough. But it doesn't take a lot of time to count five embryos. Especially if part of your job is counting embryos on an ultrasound machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the examination room opened and Thomas, Diana's coworker at Trionic, hurried in, grabbing a chair and pulling it beside Diana. \"I-I only heard you were coming here recently, sorry. With the contamination and what you were saying about the energy drink, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Jackie said, turning around and glaring at Thomas. \"This is a hospital and you can't just barge in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we work together,\" Diana said, turning back to Thomas. \"Trionic ordered you to check up on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just figured...you might want someone here,\" Thomas said, turning pale. He was starting to realize that showing up uninvited to a coworker's first ultrasound might not have been the best idea. \"Is that...should I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana sighed and gave a little smile. \"No, I'm happy to have someone here. I thought I'd want to do this alone, but it feels better to have a friend.\" Thomas grinned back. She'd never called him a friend before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight,\" Jackie finally said. Diana and Thomas both turned to face her. She turned the screen around to show them. \"Octuplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E...ight?\" Diana gasped, taking off her glasses to squint at the screen. There was no mistaking it. She had eight, four-month-along embryos growing inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...that's...\" Thomas flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you care? You're not the father,\" Jackie muttered, side-eyeing Thomas. \"But Ms. Larsen, at this point, I think I should call in the doctor to talk about...where we go next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Diana nodded, eyes fixed on the screen. With that, Jackie walked out and Thomas scooted closer to Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you...I don't know what to say, sorry,\" Thomas blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to saying anything,\" Diana sighed, a little smile on her lips. \"I'll be okay. I have a feeling that things are going to turn out okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of this because of an energy drink?\" Thomas said, shaking his head. \"We need to let people know before anyone else drinks this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be too late for that,\" Diana said as the door opened up. In walked a beautiful doctor, with long brown hair and blue eyes, a radiant aura around her. She smiled to Diana and placed a hand on her hip, which only jutted out her own pregnant belly more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Diana,\" the woman said, her soothing voice spreading over the room. But Diana wasn't calmed by her presence. She could feel her heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...\" she began, before the doctor took the ultrasound wand and began rubbing it against Diana's belly, causing her to coo and moan softly, falling back into the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes the first ultrasound can be a bit emotionally exhausting,\" the doctor smiled. \"But let's talk about what you need to do going forward to make sure mom and babies are healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana could only nod, but she had one clear thought in her head. <i>You're the woman from the commercial</i>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah walked through the floor room in Soft Lace, as unaware as always when customers leered at her. \"They should hire <u>her</u> to model the inventory,\" one man whispered to another shopper. \"Not that it'll help me see how these will look on my wife. She doesn't look anything like that blond babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd better hire someone soon,\" the other man muttered back, eyes focused on Sarah's tight, round rear. \"I heard the girl I used to come watch model lingerie got fat...then again, this one's not exactly slim either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked up to the counter and leaned forward, her post-workout jacket making her cleavage even more eye-catching as it began to poke out. Darren was looking for an inventory list and stopped to peer down at Sarah and chuckle. \"Sorry, the options we have for the higher cup-sizes are pretty limited. I can recommend you some other stores, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Sarah blushed, wishing she could zip her jacket up some more. \"I'm looking for Britney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Sarah or Diana?\" Darren asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" our hero smiled, getting one back from Darren. \"Is she here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just resting after our last run-through,\" Darren said, walking toward the runway in the store's back, waving for Sarah to follow him. \"It's going well, too. You're in for a good show tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Sarah sighed with a smile, resting one hand on her round middle. \"I could use some fun tonight.\" Darren took her through the dressing room for the models. Nico, Gisele, and Michelle were all gathered around one mirror, the two taller women bending over Gisele's shoulders to look at her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Monica?\" Darren said to them, hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking a break in the bathroom,\" Michelle said, not averting her eyes. \"Britney already checked on her and she said she's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope she's not sick,\" Darren said, shaking his head and continuing through to the stage. \"You already had that stomach bug a few days ago and I don't want that to rear its head again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped at the mention of the stomach flu. <i>I guess that wasn't my toxins being purged a few days ago...it was morning sickness</i>, she thought, stroking her belly gently. <i>Which must mean all of these girls too...what have I done</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney was walking back and forth on the stage, still dressed only in lingerie, trying to keep her head level. She was repeating the same mantra in her head over and over again: don't think about the belly. No one will be thinking about how fat you look. You're gorgeous and you're dressed amazingly. Britney sighed and turned around, repeating the same three thoughts again. No belly. No fat. You're a babe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked back, the curtain opened and Darren walked out, Sarah right behind him. \"What's up?\" Britney asked, her smile growing when she saw her roommate. \"Hi Sarah! A little early, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to talk to you,\" Darren said, stepping off stage to go to his desk in the back. \"We have a while before the next rehearsals, so I didn't see the harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm at all,\" Britney grinned as she got close enough to give Sarah a light hug. \"The other models are fun, but this has been kind of nerve-grating. I'm happy to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you too,\" Sarah replied, the ends of her lips barely curling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Britney said, her eyebrows raising while her smile persisted. \"I feel like our personalities have switched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her lip. Britney was already under so much pressure with this show. Learning she was pregnant, and possibly the rest of her runway team too, could ruin all of her composure. On the other hand, Sarah knew it was important to know and she had an obligation to make sure one of her best friends knew what was going on inside of her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's face turned burning red as she thought over her options. What to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina fluffed her crimson bangs for the sixth time as she sat in her stiff plastic chair. Looking quickly at her script, Sabrina assumed a pose and practiced her lines again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the new! Stainless pan from Mangiart, dinner's ready for the whole family quickly and easily!\" Sabrina crooned, looking quickly back at her script. \"Hmm, that's one interpretation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her were about a dozen other red-headed women, all trying to ignore her or at least stifle their laughter. Sabrina had been running through her lines...well, line like it was a 1940s movie all afternoon and she still hadn't been called in. While Sabrina did her productions for local theater, to make ends meet, she took a lot of work in commercials. Sabrina always over-acted in them and her commercials were somewhat of a local legend for how silly they looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Collins, Sabrina,\" the casting director's assistant called in a monotone from behind the heavy audition doors. Sabrina beamed and strolled into the room with her usual, graceful gait, a big smile on her lips as she looked at the casting directors. Luckily, today they were all men, so she was sure to flash her curves whenever possible to secure a better chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Ms. Collins,\" one of the directors smiled. Sabrina cleared her throat and gave a big smile with her ruby red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the! New! Stainless pan from Mangiart, why, dinner's ready for the whole family quickly and easily!\" Sabrina cooed. \"One bite and my husband remembers why he married me. Well, one of the reasons,\" she added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, please don't add lines,\" the director's assistant said. The directors were all grinning, stroking their chins and looking between their notes and Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just had the actor's flair,\" Sabrina smiled. \"So, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Collins...how should we put this,\" the head director said, lolling his head around. \"This product is marketed toward women who already have a family, not one with...a family on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would send a confusing message,\" another director said. \"But when you get a little further along, I'm sure you'd be good for a cocoa butter commercial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cocoa...butter?\" Sabrina said, her usual hand gestures dropping to her side. \"I'm...I'm not pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" the last director whispered, grimacing. \"Is she sick? Or just...very specifically fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina huffed out of the room without a word, veins on her forehead pulsing. She'd been turned down for parts before, sure, and often very rudely. But that...that was insulting on a whole different level. Sabrina held one hand against her bulging belly as she made her way past the other giggling women ready to audition. Sure, she was bloated, but...but that didn't give them the right to speculate about her being pregnant so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa there,\" a woman said as Sabrina pushed through the doors into a different section of the production building. Sabrina turned around to see another young woman leaning against the wall, smartphone in hand. Sabrina's raging brow settled a little when she saw the woman. She was an absolute beauty, with salon-quality shoulder-length brown hair, gorgeous olive skin, penetrating hazel eyes, an alluring chest, and an intrigued, pink grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Sabrina sighed, crossing her arms against her own heaving chest. \"I just...I auditioned for an ad and I was turned down very rudely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turned down?\" the woman said, slinking her way over to Sabrina. \"How could that be? You look amazing and you clearly carry yourself like an actress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try hard to,\" Sabrina said, puffing out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...I've got a few projects I'd love to have you on,\" the woman nodded, putting one arm around Sabrina's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few projects? You're a director here?\" Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I'm an executive,\" she grinned. \"But we've got lots of time to talk. What's your name, superstar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sabrina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice to meet you, Sabrina. I'm Kate.\"</span></div></div>",

Very good on the days when you don't go for a run,\" Sarah said, her voice starting to waver. \"B-but I came here to tell you...\" Sarah took one last big gulp of air before resting a hand on her swelling belly. \"We're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence hung between the two friends as Britney moved her eyes between Sarah's roundness and her own. Back and forth and back and forth. Eventually, Britney hovered her own hand above her belly, unsure whether to rest it on the ball she was just told is carrying a growing fetus.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Britney finally said, followed by \"What are you talking about? I know we're kind of bloated, but pregnant?\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant,\" Sarah nodded. \"Diana...she said the energy drinks did this to us.\"<br>\r\n\"The energy...\" Britney's voice trailed off as she put her hand to her mouth in horror. It was all settling in. She'd started getting bigger since drinking that nasty Xpect stuff. \"How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n\"Even Diana doesn't know but...look at us, Britney,\" Sarah said, her face getting redder and redder. \"We're huge.\"<br>\r\n\"Huge is kind of harsh,\" Britney mumbled, finally resting her palm against her belly. It was firm, round, warm, and there wasn't any fat anywhere else on her body, if you didn't count her growing breasts and ass. \"Are you sure about this?\"<br>\r\n\"I really don't know,\" Sarah said, her body shaking as tears welled up in her eyes again. \"I-I scheduled a doctor's appointment for myself for tomorrow and I'll know for sure.\" Sarah bit her lip. \"M-maybe you can join me? I don't want to do it alone.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Britney sighed, opening her arms. \"C'mere.\" The roommates hugged tightly, both feeling their rounding middles touching. \"We'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, we'll be okay,\" Sarah said. \"Imagine playdates with our kids and Diana's. Our apartment will be like a daycare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, I've never been too hot on kids,\" Britney chuckled. \"Are you good with-\"<br>\r\n\"I love kids!\" Sarah squealed, squeezing Britney even tighter before releasing the hug. \"I mean, I never expected to get pregnant...like this, but I'm so good with kids. It's like we're on the same level or something.\"<br>\r\n\"I could see that,\" Britney said, trying not to laugh too hard. \"But this will...this will still be a big change. I have a good job here, but I don't know if it's 'support a baby' good.\"<br>\r\n\"And it might not be just one,\" Sarah said quietly, rubbing the side of her belly. \"Diana thought that, at least. We are pretty...big.\"<br>\r\n\"So we're close to the end?\" Britney said, much more nervous than she'd been admitting. <br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Sarah said, putting her other hand on the belly's opposite side. \"Doesn't feel like it.\"<br>\r\n\"Feel like it?\" Britney said, but she couldn't protest too much. Now that she thought about it, she had a sudden maternal instinct that told her she wouldn't be going into labor for a while. It also told her there was more than one fetus inside her womb, but she ignored that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Britney?\" Gisele said, walking across the stage to approach the two friends, hugging and talking quietly. \"Oh, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine,\" Britney said, wiping a stray tear as she put on her most confident face. Gisele's own belly wasn't as pronounced as Britney's, but now that Britney knew about Xpect and its \"benefits,\" her bump was obvious, especially while she was wearing the store's lingerie. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"We were just talking about getting dinner before the last rehearsal, since we've got the time,\" Gisele said as Nico and Michelle walked out from behind the curtains. \"We've been getting so hungry lately. Must be nerves.\"<br>\r\n\"Must be,\" Britney smiled. \"Sure, sounds good. Mind if my friend Sarah joins us?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd better get home,\" Sarah blushed. Seeing Britney in lingerie was one thing. They were friends and she was used to seeing her. But the new models Britney had at this show were sexy, new sights for her eyes and they were dressed in wonderfully skimpy underwear. She gave a little sigh, knowing she'd miss a chance to dine with them individually, but there was always the after-party. \"I need to get changed out of my sweaty gym clothes and into something a little cuter for the show tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"You go to MegaGym?\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n\"I work at MegaGym,\" Sarah beamed. \"You should all come.\" She had a little grin. Sarah made it a policy not to hit on the women in her FemmeFit class, but then again, none of them looked as good as these three.<br>\r\n\"We might,\" Nico sighed, patting her belly. \"Stress has made us put on a few pounds, it looks like.<br>\r\n\"L-looks like it,\" Sarah said, flashing Britney a worried look before heading back through the curtains, head down as she passed by Monica, who also had her head down. The two bumped into one another. \"S-sorry!\" Sarah blurted out.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, sorry,\" Monica replied, both women getting a fleeting look at one another before going their separate ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren was on his cellphone in the dressing room and didn't look up to address Sarah. \"Looking for the way out?\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's kind of maze-like back here,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n\"Through that door, then straight until you hit the main floor. You can find the regular doors from there pretty easily,\" he said. \"And nice self-restraint out there,\" he added with a wink.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sarah said, before furrowing her eyebrow. \"Wait, you're not talking about...so you have...\"<br>\r\n\"Gaydar,\" Darren smiled, still not looking up. \"Bingo.\"<br>\r\n\"Why am I the only lesbian who can't do that?\" Sarah groaned. \"What, you have a lot of gay friends?\"<br>\r\n\"One very good gay friend. You could even call him my boyfriend,\" Darren laughed. Sarah left, face bright red, and headed straight home. Her first shower as a pregnant woman was interesting. Sarah found herself devoting much more attention to her belly, even though it was about the same size it was in the morning. Maybe a couple inches wider, but she couldn't tell for sure. Sarah chalked it up to a maternal care for the part of her body housing her future children. Sarah was now determined that it was more than one. Maybe even more than two. That sent some real shivers down her spine. Triplets meant lots of time in the hospital, maybe even a C-section. And that meant a lot of time off her feet and definitely no time to go to the fitness competition at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is sponsored by Xpect,\" Sarah said to herself. \"Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't know how she was supposed to tell Emily, especially since the whole thing was her idea. She'd also have to tell Emily that Xpect made her pregnant. And Rebecca. And Lori. And Nina, though whatever was happening to Nina was...different. Sarah knew she'd also given some of the guys at the gym Xpect, but did they need to be warned. Would Xpect make a man pregnant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sarah started thinking about the other women in FemmeFit. No wonder Theresa was pregnant at her old age, or Peggy getting pregnant despite getting divorced a while ago. Then there was Ms. Perkins, the Hamiltons and their daughters, Sabrina, the Smiths. Sarah felt her face getting redder and redder. She placed her hand on her belly and rubbed it slowly. Ironically, the only thing that seemed to slow her fears about the wave of pregnancy she unleashed was rubbing her own pregnant belly. \"I'm sure I'll love you little ones, but you sure came about in one of the worst possible ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five models had just finished vigorously eating at a local \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet, where the owners were starting to re-think their business model after more and more newly pregnant groups and families dined there. Britney noticed bellies big and small around the restaurant. <i>Sarah wasn't the only one giving that stuff out</i> she worried. As they got back into the promotional van for Soft Lace, Britney saw Nico and Gisele comparing bellies.<br>\r\n\"You must have eaten more than me,\" Nico said, rolling up her shirt to reveal her pale bump.<br>\r\n\"It's because you're taller,\" Gisele pouted. \"At least you're also getting bigger tits out of it too. I have some old training bras I can lend you.\"<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" Nico sneered, rolling her eyes. Sarah blushed, wondering if she should tell the other women they were pregnant now. Ultimately, Sarah knew they needed their head in the game for the first show. None of these women had any runway experience and if they learned they were pregnant hours before going on stage, it would be a disaster. Britney was barely holding it together herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Darren said, turning to Britney in the passenger's seat.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Britney said. He gave her a funny look and nodded his head toward Monica, seated right behind her. Britney turned around and gave the quiet girl a light rub on the thigh. Monica was the only one with a belly around Britney's size. \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Monica replied quietly.<br>\r\n\"You excited for tonight?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"You should be. You're amazing on stage and you're so fucking good looking. This will take you places,\" Britney smiled. \"New York, L.A., Milan. They'll be calling you non-stop.\" Monica gave the hints of a smile and Britney's smile grew in response. \"I have a friend coming who's like a kid's coloring book in human form. If you don't act a little cheerier around you, you'll be obliterated by her radiance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't want that,\" Monica chuckled, bringing her head up. She moved her brown bangs out of her eyes and smiled. \"Thanks, Britney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time,\" Britney smiled, turning back around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should introduce her to your friend,\" Darren whispered. \"They'd get along <u>very</u> well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just an...intuition,\" Darren smiled, turning the van toward the biggest night of their lives.</span></div></div>",

Instead, two annoyingly faint sounds filled the Hamilton's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was Maci's soft sobs as she texted frantically. She was one of the most popular girls in high school, and even during her college hiatus, Maci remained a \"socialite\" to whatever extent that's appropriate for preppy teenagers. Her Instagram posts got at least a thousand likes in 24 hours, she was never alone when she prowled around the mall, and she was always making very lewd eye contact with someone in a public place. Now, Maci learned she was pregnant with twins at age 19 and she hadn't even had sex yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was the muted blare of Warlock's \"I Rule the Ruins\" coming from Laci's headphones. If Laci wore her headphones on her head \u2014 a novel idea \u2014 maybe the sound would have been blocked more. But instead, Laci had her headphones around her budding belly, resting her hand on her pale mound of maternal flesh. It was only painted pale, of course. Laci was cursed with the same gorgeous looks as her twin sister Maci, right down to the natural golden tan. As Laci entered her \"goth\" lifestyle as a young girl, she hated looking too conventional, but as her libido grew and women started coming around to her tall, busty body, Laci decided it wasn't always so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to have your headphones on like that?\" David groaned from the driver's seat. \"We can all hear it, Laci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to give my babies strong female role models early,\" Laci said, her black lips curling into a smile. \"Doro Pesch is an inspiration. Just be glad I'm waiting until we get home to put on 7 Year Bitch's 'Dead Men Don't Rape.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci,\" Trisha said, turning around. \"Please, just for today...\" Her voice got quieter. \"Your father's having a hard time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>He's</u> having a hard time?\" Maci said. \"He's not the one having babies in college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not suppose to have any!\" David yelled, slamming his hand against the steering wheel. There was another moment of silence before he spoke again. \"I'm sorry gang, I'll try to chill out.\" He was going back to his \"hip dad\" approach he'd been working on to get his daughters to talk to him again, but it was just a mask for his own concerns. What weighed on him the most wasn't that his wife was pregnant again at age 47 or that both of his teenage daughters were pregnant, and not even that he, somehow, was pregnant...although upon immediate review, this was very central in his thoughts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was currently bothering David Hamilton the most was the discovery that his neighbor, Tami Smith, was pregnant with his children. She hadn't told him it was multiples yet, but he hedged his bets. It was a one-time exchange of sex for realtor access; something he'd done before and no one ever got pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" Laci said, raising a dyed eyebrow as she leaned forward. \"My stop's around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what?\" David said, the house he'd secured for his family crumbling in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My photoshoot. I told you about it,\" Laci sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right!\" David said, swerving the car to pull into the next set of buildings. \"Here? Go have fun, Laci. Get some great shots. We can share them with your grandparents and aunts and uncles and...and everyone will see what a great, growing family we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David...\" Trisha said, whispering again. \"I thought we weren't going to encourage this...alternative behavior from Laci anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm cool with it,\" David grinned, giving his daughter and wife a thumbs-up. \"We've all just got different styles, ya dig? Go kick it, Laci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Laci said, waddling out of the car while rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dad?\" Maci said. \"If you're saying Laci can go to her thing now, can I go with my friend to the fashion show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fashion show,\" David said, as if hearing the words in his own voice would jog his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lingerie show. My friend's a model and she said she could get me in. You and Mom said I couldn't go but, I mean...Laci's girlfriend is going to be at the photoshoot and she's even older than Gisele.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend?\" David choked as they drove off. \"O-older?\" Trisha just put her hand in her head, shaking it slowly as she looked at her belly. \"Well...it's only fair then, isn't it? You can go, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Maci sniffed. \"It might make me feel better, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully,\" Trisha sighed. \"Just don't stay out too late and no boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll be popular with boys for about five months,\" Maci scoffed, resting a hand on her belly, much more bundled up than Laci's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still lovely, Maci,\" Trisha smiled, looking up at the rear view mirror. \"And actually it's...closer to 10 months. 40 weeks, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci then let out what may be the world's longest groan. It was hard to measure because it was eventually drowned out with the sound of Maci quickly texting everyone she knew that yes, she would be at the fashion show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is,\" Robin smiled, opening her arms wide to embrace her pregnant girlfriend. \"Oof, and there they are. I feel your belly pressing against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it,\" Laci said, kissing Robin's neck. \"Is everything set up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we need is our model,\" Robin said, motioning to Laci. \"The blue dress is over here if you're ready to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue,\" Laci chuckled, petting her hand against the material. \"I'm only wearing this for accuracy. Normally I wouldn't be caught dead in something this frilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't disrespect what Rosemary wore,\" Robin said, wagging a finger as she walked to her camera and tripod. \"She carried the devil's child. You're just carrying my magical lesbian babies.\" Laci stuck her tongue and stripped in front of her girlfriend, slipping the dress over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a maternity dress,\" Laci said, pulling it down with some effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it would accentuate the bump,\" Robin said. \"Isn't that what you're going for?\" When it was finally on, Laci was still covered in black eyeliner, lipstick, and finger polish as Robin stood behind Laci, tying her hair up to be closer to Mia Farrow's pixie cut in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin wasn't what you'd call a \"goth,\" but she wouldn't fit in with Maci's group of friends either. Robin was 31 and about Laci's height, maybe a little shorter, and had the same ample chest Laci had before she got pregnant. In contrast to Laci's jet black dyed hair, Robin had her hair bleached white, with a light red dusting on the tips. Her hair was short and slicked back so her green eyes could be shown off. Currently, she had a ratty white shirt with the sleeves cut off and a denim vest on, covered in buttons from bands she did road work for when she was Laci's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just stand in front of the baby carriage with the knife,\" Robin said, walking back to her camera and looking through the guide. \"Good, now look shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have to be <i>exactly</i> like in Rosemary's Baby?\" Laci said. \"I mean, if I were in her shoes, I'd look a lot happier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do a few takes,\" Robin laughed. \"Now come on, let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...let's think about it a little,\" Laci said. The knife in her hand was starting to tremble. Robin walked over to Laci and took the knife from her, placing it in the baby carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Robin said, petting her hand against Laci's cheek. \"I can tell when something's not going right for you, queenie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci took a deep breath. \"I...you know I love pregnancy and the idea of feeling something suck my nutrients and kick and squirm inside my womb, changing my body and forcing me to eat weird things and pee all the time, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You said it was the most metal thing you could think of,\" Robin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I still feel that way, it's just...it's real. It's really happening,\" Laci whispered. \"And now that I've had the ultrasound and all, it's...I'm scared, Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took Laci in a big hug and held her close. \"It's going to be okay, yeah? We'll take care of them, together.\" Robin's voice dropped. \"I never thought I would love someone this much until I met you, Laci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't think I would love anyone period,\" Laci sighed. \"It's so...unlike me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you tried something new,\" Robin said, putting her hand against Laci's chin. \"How about this: we do these photos, then I take you out for a big dinner. I hear preggos like that kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might,\" Laci grinned. \"And then after...I've been curious about what Mother Kills Best were singing about with 'Bellies in the Bedroom.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out together,\" Robin smiled, placing her hand against Laci's belly. \"But for now, you'll kill me if we don't do this photoshoot.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah looked around for anyone she recognized and checked her phone again. Her hair was done up in a tight bun and she had on a black dress she hadn't worn in forever. Of course, with her belly the way it was, much less of her legs were covered than the dressmakers likely intended. It was almost time to start and Diana still hadn't shown up. \"C'mon, c'mon,\" Sarah said to herself. There weren't many seats for this relatively small event and they were filling up quickly. Sarah managed to save a few seats but wasn't sure how much longer they'd last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this seat taken?\" a voice said behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Sarah said, immediately putting her hand on her belly. \"Please don't take it. It's for my other pregnant friend.\" She'd gotten accustomed to milking her newly-discovered pregnancy for sympathy quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sarah?\" Maci said, jaw dropping. Sarah turned to see that the voice belonged to one of her twin neighbors and heaved herself quickly. \"You're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Sarah sighed, rubbing her belly some more. \"And I heard you're also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Maci said, looking down at her bump. She had a noticeable roundness now, but nowhere near Sarah's considerable pregnant girth. <i>If I'm already this big with twins, how many is she carrying</i>? Maci wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always across the hall,\" Sarah smiled, opening her arms for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sorta already talking with Britney,\" Maci said, running one hand through her hair and looking away bashfully before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No...no hug</i>? Sarah tried to process as she reached under her belly, preparing to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't strain yourself yet,\" Diana grinned, tapping Sarah on the shoulder. Sarah turned around and saw her friend beaming behind her glasses. Her lovely blond hair was tossed with special care for the evening and she managed to squeeze into an elegant blue dress with a white jacket overtop. Sarah squealed and dove in, giving Diana another colossal hug. \"Sorry I took so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry!\" Sarah smiled, finally opening her eyes to see Thomas standing beside Diana. \"Who's he?\" she whispered in Diana's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend,\" Diana smiled back, patting Sarah on the back. \"He's been a big help, so I invited him here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Thomas said with a wave. In no time, Sarah was trying to manuver herself past Diana and to Thomas for a hug, her belly butting the heads of several audience members in the row ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any friend of Diana is a friend of mine,\" Sarah said, hugging Thomas tightly, only pulling back when she felt an odd \"poke\" against her belly. \"S-so...how do you know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas works with me,\" Diana said before dropping her voice. \"He helped me find out about...the drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed before clumsily making her way back to her seat. She and Diana let out long sighs of relief as they sat down, rubbing one another's bellies. \"So...how was the ultrasound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Diana said. \"Everything's healthy and having an ultrasound doesn't hurt or anything. It's just cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\" Sarah took a big gulp. \"How many are you carrying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana turned and looked Sarah in the eyes for a few seconds, building up her resolve. \"Eight, all three months along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt her face tingle, her skin not sure whether to blush or turn pale. \"Pregnant with eight...you're like the octo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it,\" Diana smirked. \"But the good news is it looks like you're carrying less than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to be sure,\" Sarah sighed, moving her hand to the side of her belly when she felt a strange twinge. \"Diana...I think I just felt a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin,\" Darren's voice said over the speakers. \"Please silence your cellphones and give the runway your full attention. For the first time, Soft Lace is ready to model our original line of lingerie. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" Sarah said, leaning forward. As she prepared herself to see some gorgeous models walk around in lingerie, she couldn't help think of the last time she saw Kate wearing something sexy. Before the break-up, before Sarah threw herself into exercise, and long before she ever felt the weight of pregnancy in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've got the part?\" Sabrina said. Kate sat in her chair across the room, watching the red-headed aspiring actress with a loaded smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Kate nodded, looking at her cellphone. \"At least for one of our ad campaigns. Tomorrow I'll have to ask you to join me for some more personal auditions, but I feel good about where we're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Sabrina said with a relieved laugh. \"It's been a while since I was part of a larger commercial.\" She looked back to see Kate looking up from her phone, her vixen smile not going away. \"B-but of course, my goal is to be an actress on the screen or on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it in you,\" Kate said, standing up and getting close to Sabrina. \"You have a classic Hollywood look about you. Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland,\" Kate said, putting her hand on Sabrina's chin. \"Maybe a little Hedy Lamarr too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, thank you,\" Sabrina blushed. This woman had a much larger presence than she first noticed when bumping into Kate in the hall. \"S-so...where should I come tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's lips gave away a small laugh before taking her hand away from Sabrina's face. She looked at her phone for a second or so before gazing back at Sabrina. \"Meet me here at 10 in the morning,\" Kate said. \"Wear comfortable clothing. There will be changes here for the various scenes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much,\" Sabrina said, giving a flourish with her hands. \"You'll find hiring me will be one of the best choices of your career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to seeing you prove that true,\" Kate grinned. \"But I have to make an important phone call, so if you don't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Sabrina nodded, waddling away as quickly as she could, her heart beating with joy. Kate chuckled again before tapping her phone a few times and bringing it to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there,\" a voice cooed on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Robin,\" Kate smiled. \"Plans tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just at a photoshoot now, but when it's over, I should have a pretty uneventful night,\" Robin said, waving to Laci from behind the studio's doors. Laci couldn't hear a thing she was saying. \"I take it you have something in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My things are all moved in and I'd love for you to see my apartment the way I intended,\" Kate chuckled. \"The bed was practically the only thing finished up when you were over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing, too,\" Robin smiled, bringing one finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did have one other thing I wanted to do tonight, though,\" Kate said. \"There's a fashion show and a...friend will be there. I want to at least stop by, maybe say a 'hello.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's that good-looking, huh?\" Robin laughed. \"Maybe I should come too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like,\" Kate said. \"And yes, she was fine, but...not good for too long. We fooled around when I was shopping around for a new apartment, but got clingy. I set her straight the day before I moved back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sturdier?\" Robin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so,\" Kate grinned. \"See you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you,\" Robin said, hanging up and walking back into the studio. \"So beautiful, what next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to do the same shots, but now do them the way <u>I</u> want,\" Laci said with an evil smile. \"Black bikini, big grin on my face as I hold the knife, that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some fake blood on the belly?\" Robin smiled. \"I can live with that. Just strip when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always ready,\" Laci said, taking off her top, letting her bare, swollen breasts hang down. \"I just need that bikini.\"</span></div></div>",

Michelle responded with a brisk, smiling nod, while Nico and Gisele both rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n\"Just let us go out already!\" Gisele groaned. \"I finally got my boobs looking the way I like and if I stay backstage any longer, this stupid tight bra will mess them up again.\"<br>\r\n\"They'll be bouncing around when you go on stage, so they're just get 'messed up' anyway,\" Nico chuckled.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't expect you to understand,\" Gisele hissed.<br>\r\n\"You both sound good,\" Britney said, moving to Monica. \"And you?\"<br>\r\n\"As ready as I'll ever be,\" she shrugged with a smile. Britney grinned back and patted Monica on the back.<br>\r\n\"Good to hear,\" Britney said, moving to the front of the line as the music began to change. \"Well then: here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney stepped out and onto the runway, the audience gasping as the clapping began. Britney let herself have a small gulp of nervousness, but otherwise, she continued her walk with a solemn, quietly-sexy expression. One hand on her hip, the other moving back and forth at a light pace. She would have liked to think the audience was gasping at how she looked. Bright white lingerie hugged her hips and ass while a slightly darker bone colored top kept her breasts in place without a strap, and over the course of the past few days, her chest had grown to an F-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what people initially gasped at was her stomach. Britney was, as she learned today, four months pregnant with an unknown number of fetuses. Definitely more than twins, she suspected. Her bulge was obvious and pronounced, but Britney couldn't stop the show to explain that this only happened a few days ago and it was because of a mysterious energy drink. Britney made it to the end of the runway and looked at Darren, standing in the back behind a barely lit podium. He gave Britney a small nod and she turned, making her way backstage.<br>\r\nAs she made the turn, the applause came up again. A good sign, maybe. <i>At least the crowd's polite</i>, Britney thought. <i>Although, even pregnant, I look pretty good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the same mixture of applause and surprised chatter started up again when Michelle walked out. Her belly wasn't as big as Britney's so the audience took more time to react. In the audience, Sarah felt her face grow red as Diana leaned over to her.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said you only gave this stuff to Britney and me,\u201d Diana whispered.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I may have left out some names,\u201d Sarah gulped. \u201cAnd I may have also left some cans in Britney\u2019s work bag.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSarah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted her to be healthy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplause drowned them out again as Gisele walked out. Sarah was glad she focused in time for her. The shorter Latina model was now boasting I-cups thanks to her pregnancy and the lacy top she had on was letting most of her endowment present itself to the audience. Sarah leaned in, putting one hand under her belly for leverage.<br>\r\n\u201cLike her?\u201d Diana chuckled.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean\u2026\u201d Sarah bit her lip. \u201cShe\u2019d never go for me.\u201d Diana sighed and put her arm around Sarah\u2019s shoulder as Nico walked out.<br>\r\nThe two models\u2019 bellies bumped slightly as they passed by and turned to face one another. Darren sighed and rubbed his forehead. \u201cThey\u2019re rookies alright,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut at least they\u2019re still on their feet. Not a disaster.\u201d<br>\r\nNico made it to the end of the runway, poise maintained until a look of confusion flashed across her face. She looked down at her belly and placed one hand on it, rubbing gently.<br>\r\n\u201cNico!\u201d Darren hissed, getting her attention. He pointed to the back and Nico nodded, trying to regain composure as she finished the catwalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Britney said as Nico came back inside. Britney was already halfway through her outfit change and was beginning to panic. She\u2019d practiced this so many times but didn\u2019t account for the difficulty in changing lingerie with a big belly. A big pregnant belly, on top of it.<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Nico said, rubbing her belly. \u201cI-I felt something weird in my stomach. Like\u2026something was in there.\u201d<br>\r\nBritney turned pale as Gisele, now totally naked, elbowed Nico and laughed. \u201cJust indigestion from that big dinner,\u201d Gisele smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a giant, so it takes longer to work its way through your body.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHa-ha,\u201d Nico said sarcastically, moving to her own changing station to get ready. Britney cracked a worried smile and finished getting her underwear around her growing hips. Then, she peeked out to see how Monica was doing on-stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were fixed on the shy model. The only sounds were the music and the camera flashes. Monica was nailing everything: the walk, the look, the poise. Most people may have not even noticed that she was as pregnant-looking as Britney.<br>\r\nOne look in particular was especially glued: Sarah\u2019s. Her jaw was dropped and her heart was racing. As Monica made it to the end of the catwalk, she gave a tiny, superficial smile. A curl of the lips that was barely there. Sarah let out an audible moan when she saw it. Diana turned to her friend in surprise. When Monica was backstage again, Sarah met Diana\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cSarah?\u201d Diana grinned. Sarah turned bright red and buried her face in her hands. \u201cShe was cute, huh?\u201d<br>\r\nSarah just nodded, face still in her hands.<br>\r\nDiana leaned in closer, whispering in Sarah\u2019s ear. \u201cThere\u2019s an after-party, right? Talk to her.\u201d<br>\r\nSarah jolted back up and looked Diana in the eye. \u201cY-you think she\u2019d\u2026I mean\u2026me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think she\u2019d be crazy not to,\u201d Diana smiled, laughing as Sarah gave her friend a hug.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is how I get rid of my bad emotions, like fear and reluctance and a desire to eat fried dough,\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Diana said, looking back at Britney\u2019s own seductive gait. \u201cBritney\u2019s on stage now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about seeing her in underwear,\u201d Sarah said, finally releasing the hug when the applause started again. \u201cBut let\u2019s not miss those other women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went on like that, with Sarah oozing over the three models, and then falling to pieces when Monica walked out. Falling for a pregnant woman was never something Britney had thought much about, but maybe she just wanted someone like herself.<br>\r\nBackstage, Michelle and Gisele had begun to complain about a weird sensation in their bellies too. Britney told them both it was a combination of eating too much and nerves from the show, but by her fourth walk, Britney could feel it too. The babies were kicking.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you want me to take a nap, huh?\u201d Britney sighed, patting her bulge.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Monica said, changing beside Britney.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Britney smiled. \u201cYou look fantastic out there. You\u2019re a pro.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh,\u201d Monica smiled, dipping her head a bit. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust one last run and we can relax,\u201d Britney smiled. \u201cKeep it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last walk was the hardest. Britney\u2019s fetuses were kicking the entire walk and when it got particularly bad, Britney could hear people in the audience murmuring. Her swollen belly must have been moving and squirming visibly. Michelle, Gisele, and Nico all seemed distracted by the strange sensation in their bellies, not knowing they were all four months pregnant. <br>\r\nMonica ended up saving the show on the last walk of the night, giving a powerful but soothing look to the audience and giving a perfect twirl at the end of the walkway. Britney wanted to rush out and hug her. Sarah too, but obviously for different reasons.<br>\r\nWhen it was over, the six Soft Lace employees went on stage and took a bow. \u201cNone of this would have been possible without the amazing leadership of my close co-worker, Britney,\u201d Darren boasted.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t have stayed sane if it wasn\u2019t for my close co-worker, Darren,\u201d Britney smiled, and the two shared a kiss on the cheek. \u201cIf you have a VIP ticket, you\u2019re very welcome to join us at the after-party in the store\u2019s showroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTables of hors-d\u2019oeuvres were already prepared and the crowd\u2019s various pregnant members began whittling them down quickly. Britney and the other models were wrapped up in robes thick enough to mostly conceal their bellies.<br>\r\nDarren walked over to Britney to give her another \u201ccongratulations\u201d talk, but Sarah and Diana were already there, giving her a tremendous pregnant group hug. He and Britney made eye contact before he chuckled and went to look for his boyfriend.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were so good,\u201d Sarah whined. \u201cYou were all amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot just saying that?\u201d Britney smiled, eyebrows raised in worry.<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, she\u2019s not,\u201d Diana grinned. \u201cIn fact~\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDiana!\u201d Sarah said, biting her lip before taking a big breath. \u201cA-actually, I was wondering if you could introduce me to one of the models. I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d two people, a man and a woman in expensive clothes, said, approaching Britney. \u201cI was hoping we could speak.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cO-o-of course,\u201d Britney stammered. This was Margaret D\u2019Anne and Roger Corgan, two of the fashion world\u2019s premiere investors. Britney gave the party a quick glance and motioned her hand in the direction of the closest robe. \u201cThere\u2019s one. Go ahead and talk to them, Sarah. They\u2019re very friendly girls.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Sarah nodded, walking up to Monica as Britney looked back at the two investors.<br>\r\n\u201cWe just wanted to say\u2026that was a brilliant show,\u201d Roger said.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was?\u201d Britney said, surprised by his word choice.<br>\r\n\u201cPregnant models when they\u2019re not expected? I love experimental fashion,\u201d Margaret beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s why we were wondering if you\u2019d want part in a show we\u2019re sponsoring.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cO-one of your shows?\u201d Britney choked.<br>\r\n\u201cPregnant lingerie. Only this time, people are expecting the expectant,\u201d Roger laughed. \u201cInterested?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Britney laughed, hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked up to Monica and tapped her on the shoulder. \u201cH-hi,\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\nMonica\u2019s freckled cheeks turned slightly redder when she saw Sarah. \u201cHi.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I-I'm Sarah.  I live with Britney.\" Sarah smiled, wrapping her arm under her belly.  \"So YOU'RE the Sarah that Britney's been telling me about!  She's been mentioning you a lot lately!\" Monica said.  The two looked over at Britney, who was stuffing her face with cocktail shrimp.  She glanced up at Sarah and Monica, and gave a \"thumbs up\", before digging in again.  \"I'm Monica, by the way.\" she said, reaching out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hand shot out as she shook Monica's hand almost violently.  Up close and personal, she could see that Monica was truly beautiful.  <i>Oh god, I think my hand's sweaty!</i> Sarah thought, keeping her beaming smile intact.  \"Sorry, I really don't want to sound rude if I'm wrong, but are you...pregnant?\" Monica asked, glancing at Sarah's round belly.  \"Me?  Oh, yeah!  Why do you ask?\" Sarah asked, almost forgetting she was pregnant for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...I have so much...respect for pregnant women. I mean the amount of shit you have to go through for nine months is incredible.\" Monica said.  <i>The way this pregnancy's going, I doubt it's going to be nine months.</i>  \"Aww, thanks!  Wanna feel the belly?\" Sarah asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's face lit up.  \"YES!  I-I mean, sure...\" she said.  Monica placed her hands on Sarah's swollen belly, feeling it's somewhat familiar roundness.  \"So how far along are you?\"  Monica asked curiously.  \"Four months!\" Sarah said.  \"Seriously?  I would have guessed like, six or something!  Are you having twins?\" she pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...I don't know.  So you were really great tonight!  Even better than Britney, just don't tell her I said that!\" Sarah quipped, trying to change the subject.  \"Thanks!  You know, I've been really nervous the past few days because I've been feeling a little...different.  But it's nice that people liked it!\"  Monica beamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked down at Monica's own protruding stomach, and noticed that it was about the same size as her's.  And Britney's, for that matter.  Almost on cue, a large rumble emitted from Monica's belly.  She blushed, her freckles blending in to her reddening face.  \"So...wanna go get a burger or something?\" Sarah asked.  Monica slowly nodded her head, biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to the nearest burger joint, and they both ordered twice the amount of what they usually ordered.  They chowed down on their burgers, chatting each other up as they did so.  \"So what do you do for a living, Sarah?\" Monica asked.  \"I work at MegaGym.  I run my own Femme-Fit class.\" Sarah replied.  \"You work at MegaGym?  Think you could get me a discount?  Kidding, but I really should start going there.  Work this belly off.\" Monica smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have a husband?\" Monica asked.  \"Nope.\" Sarah replied.  \"Oh.  Boyfriend?\" Monica asked again.  \"Nada.  I'm actually gay.\" Sarah said.  \"Well, if you don't mind me asking, how'd you get pregnant?\" she questioned.  \"It...it's complicated.  Do you have a boyfriend?\" Sarah asked.  \"Nuh-uh.\" Monica replied, biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finished their meal, and Sarah drove Monica back to her apartment.  \"Do you want me to walk you to the door?\" Sarah asked.  \"Uh...I mean, is it too much of a bother for you?\" Monica responded.  \"No, not at all!  I might have this big belly, but I'm still in pretty good shape!\" Sarah laughed.  She waddled after her new crush, and the two stopped at the door.  \"Sarah, I had a really good time tonight.\" Monica smiled.  \"Really?  Me too!\"  Sarah said gleefully.  Monica leaned in and gave her an unexpected peck on the cheek, causing Sarah to gasp.  \"Nice meeting you, Sarah.\" Monica said, smiling as she closed the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt the lipstick Monica left on her cheek, then pumped her fist.  \"Yeah!\" she yelled, feeling her babies kick hard in response.  \"That's right, kids!  Mama's got game!\" she said, returning back to her apartment.  She opened the door, and saw Britney casually walking around in the nude.  \"Britney, I know we're friends, but what the hell?\" Sarah asked.  \"Sorry!  These babies have been kicking nonstop, I've been trying everything to get them to stop.  Look!\" she said, waddling towards Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Britney's great big belly was shaking and squirming visibly.  \"Does it hurt?\" Sarah asked, giving Britney's stomach a poke.  \"Not really, but it's really, really uncomfortable!  Why don't you're babies kick so much?\" Britney asked.  \"I don't know.  Different babies.  Different bellies.\" Sarah responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'm going to bed, goodnight.\" she said.  \"Wait!  How was the date with Monica?\" Britney asked.  \"Date?  I wouldn't really call it a date.  More of a...meet and greet.  Night.\" Sarah smiled, walking into her bedroom.  \"So everyone finds some love except Britney, huh?  Fitting.\" she said to herself.  \"Will you stop already?\" she shouted to her squirming belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's head hit the pillow, and she felt a sense of calmness she hadn't felt in a while.  \"Good night, babies.  At least tomorrow I'll actually find out how many of you I'm having,\" Sarah said, remembering that she had her ultrasound tomorrow.  She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, rubbing her belly with love. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Britney let out another sigh as the throngs of pregnant customers grew more and more restless. \"I need to see how this will fit on me!\" one woman with a jutting bare belly yelled, as she stroked it with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If you'd just wait, one of our other models may be able to help,\" Britney said, trying to squeeze into a bra that was clearly too small for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time for that. I'll never get to be this pregnant again and I want to be sexy while I still can,\" the same woman protested. \"Your signs say you model the lingerie. Now do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll try another pair,\" Britney said, blushing as she stripped down once again to try and pull a pair of lacy panties up her wide hips, further stretched out by the slope of her colossal belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you're not fitting into it,\" the woman groaned. \"Why does your belly have to be so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Britney whined, looking down at her monstrously huge bare pregnant belly. \"I didn't even plan on getting pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney!\" Sarah yelled as she jogged through the pregnant crowds to get to her friend. She only had on a sports bra and was dripping with sweat. \"My water broke while I was running. Can you drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water broke?\" Britney gulped. It was really happening. \"S-sure, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you still need to try on my lingerie!\" the first pregnant woman yelled, grabbing Britney's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney, c'mon! I can already feel contractions!\" Sarah said, grabbing Britney's other arm. \"Monica's water broke too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica?\" Britney panted, starting to feel a tightness in her womb as well. As the two pregnant women pulled her back and forth, her stress finally came to a head as she felt her lap get wet. \"M-my water just broke too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney jolted awake, kicking her legs out as she looked around her dark bedroom, groaning as her head hit the pillow. Her dream left her so exhausted, she might as well not have slept at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up in her bed, Britney rubbed her face before turning her attention back to her belly. Before, when she absently rubbed her bloated stomach, she thought it was a strange habit to have. But now that she knew it was a pregnant belly, Britney felt differently. She may not be ecstatic at the thought of being pregnant now, but Britney was not above feeling her own belly. Once again, it had grown overnight and anyone looking at Britney would think she was ready to give birth any second now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't feel like it, though,\" Britney sighed, patting her bulge. \"But that's for the doctors to decide, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a surprise to Britney that she didn't sleep very well. She had a bit of a...shock before heading back home from the fashion show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney clasped her hands together in glee as Margaret and Roger walked away. A fashion show for two of the biggest names in designer lingerie! This was a career-maker. Of course, there was the little detail of it being for \"pregnant\" lingerie, but this wasn't bothering Britney too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be nice if you worked in my favor,\" Britney giggled to herself, patting her bulge over her robe. Out of the corner of her eye, Britney noticed a few other VIPs whispering to themselves and looking in her direction, so Britney played up her pregnant. Pouting her lips and popping a hip, Britney ran her hand slowly and sensually over her belly, showing off the size of her belly, laughing a little to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're talking about me,\" Kate purred in Britney's ear. Britney turned around quickly, her robe coming undone in the process. Kate laughed as she covered her mouth with one hand, looking directly at Britney's belly. \"Wow, I wanted to confirm for myself, but I didn't think I'd get to see it this up close. Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" Britney growled, looking Kate dead in the eye. \"This is my business and I can have you removed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really your business,\" Kate said with a sarcastic smirk. \"You're an employee, and while you put on a very nice show, the owner is still him,\" Kate said, pointing to the stuffy, suited-up millionaire who owned Soft Lace and about a dozen other clothing stores, currently talking with Margaret and Roger. \"And I don't think he would want to kick out a beauty like me just because I 'dumped your friend.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, stay if you want,\" Britney huffed. \"But just don't talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually looking to see someone else here,\" Kate smiled. As Britney was turning around, this last sentence snapped her back into Kate's face, her belly pressed tightly against Kate's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you want to torment Sarah some more? You know how much of a wreck she was after you tossed her like a piece of trash? You're a monster, Kate, and a sociopath,\" Britney hissed. \"I may be pregnant, but if I see you bother her, I'll break your nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy,\" Kate chuckled. \"I didn't even know Sarah's here. I wanted to see one of your models, Monica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used to date,\" Kate said, not backing away from Britney despite her threat. \"She gave me these tickets a while back. Know where she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney thought about how miserable Monica had been acting and remembered Darren mentioning something about a bad breakup. \"You bitch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again,\" Diana said, putting a hand on Britney's shoulder, looking Kate right in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too,\" Kate said, her smile growing. \"Looks like two congratulations are in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way,\" Diana said, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought you were both the 'family' types. All you need is to get Sarah knocked up and you can open a nursery.\" Diana and Britney both bit their lips and Kate's grinning jaw dropped. \"Wait, don't tell me...she really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Thomas, there you are,\" Diana said, grabbing Thomas' arm as he passed by and pulling him in close. Diana planted a kiss on his lips and turned to Britney. \"Sarah left with one of the other models, so did you want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well,\" Britney said. \"The party here's gotten pretty dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Diana smiled, kissing Thomas again while keeping her eyes on Kate, who chewed her lip while keeping a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice catching up,\" Kate said. \"Now that I'm back in town, I'll probably see you all again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana and Britney both walked to the buffet table, with Diana dragging Thomas along by the arm. His face was bright red and his knees were a little weak. \"Thomas, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm...uh,\" Thomas managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was the one blushing now. \"Kate's always had a crush on me, so I wanted to make her stew a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, right,\" Thomas nodded. \"Of course.\" Thomas had never met Kate or knew anything about her relationship to Diana, Britney, or Sarah, but his brain was reeling so much from being kissed by Diana that it was just throwing out the simplest words it could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe her,\" Britney growled, gripping the table cloth of the buffet. Diana put her hand over hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least Sarah's moving on,\" Diana smiled gently. \"That model of yours, Monica...Sarah really took a liking to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica?\" Britney said, a tiny smile growing. \"What were the chances...both of the nicest girls you could meet, both dumped by Kate, now dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dating's a bit of a jump,\" Diana laughed, rubbing her belly as it jiggled. \"Don't...ask her about it until she's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Britney nodded. \"Geez, a date the same day you find out you're pregnant. I couldn't imagine going on a date in my condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, Britney,\" Diana said, putting a hand on her friend's shoulder. \"Even now, if you wanted to go out, you'd have guys flocking. Isn't she good-looking, Thomas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so beautiful,\" Thomas slurred, looking at Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Diana said, smiling. \"Now, are we hanging out some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably go home,\" Britney said, stretching out. \"I'm so goddamn tired and these kids weigh a ton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Diana sighed, resting a hand on her belly. She'd tell Britney the big \"octuplet\" news tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Britney waddled into the kitchen, Sarah was already standing there, glistening with sweat from her run and gulping down water. \"Good run?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For my first pregnant run, it wasn't bad,\" Sarah smiled. \"Well, not 'first,' but you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Britney nodded, sighing. \"Ready for the ultrasound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah paused and looked down at her belly. \"I'm ready to take this whole pregnancy thing on head-first. I want to find out if they're healthy, if I'm having boys or girls or one of each or...or however many are in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know how many too,\" Britney said with a nervous laugh, pulling some fruit out of the fridge. \"And how big they're going to be...a-and if they're healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't care if they're boys or girls?\" Sarah said. \"No preference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney shrugged. \"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's an equal number of both,\" Sarah beamed, stroking her belly. \"I've never had a sex-balanced fitness class before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, they're your children, not a class at MegaGym,\" Britney laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I'll be much more hands-on than at MegaGym,\" Sarah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney rolled her eyes and butted her belly against Sarah's. \"Well get showered, Richard Simmons, and we'll go see for ourselves. The ultrasound appointment is soon.\"</span></div></div>",

She typed out &lt;I think so&gt; but paused and reconsidered, deleting her message and tapping out a new one. &lt;yes&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Sarah said, handing Britney an orange soda from the vending machine. \"Normally I'd encourage you to just get a water, but I know how strong cravings can be.\" Sarah plopped down in her seat, a bottle of flavored iced tea in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney smiled, taking the bottle from Sarah. \"Thanks,\" she said, turning back to her phone and opening up another text thread just between her and Monica. &lt;here's Sarah's number&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;she wants to talk again?&gt; Monica texted back quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;trust me&gt; Britney said back, stifling a giggle on her end. &lt;talk to her&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Sarah asked, a curious smile on her own lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Britney said, struggling to stuff her phone back in her pockets. Pregnancy had made her pants even tighter, but with some effort, the phone was back in. On their fifth day of pregnancy, Sarah and Britney's bellies were both enormous and jutted far from their body, beyond the ability of their clothes to conceal it all. But they weren't alone: the doctor's office was packed with big-bellied men and women, all nervously stroking their middles. Most of them clearly didn't buy maternity clothing and their bellies came on as a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I swear I didn't give Xpect to all of these people,\" Sarah whispered to Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Britney sighed. \"Does MegaGym have any fitness classes for kids? You could make a killing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stick with FemmeFit,\" Sarah said, boasting a bit. \"Though I guess I'll have to start taking Nina's maternity fitness class. You too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" Britney smiled, looking back at her belly, rubbing and patting it. \"Can you feel...moving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Sarah cooed, putting her hands on both sides of her bulge. \"There's something going on in there, for sure. When do babies start kicking inside the womb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, but I'd think we have to be pregnant more than a week to feel it,\" Britney scoffed. \"This is no typical pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richardson?\" Jackie, the same pregnant nurse Diana had, said, rubbing her own triplet belly as she looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah raised her hand and heaved out of her seat. Britney joined her, envious of Sarah's super-fitness allowing her so much pregnant mobility. It took Britney about twice as long to stand up with her big belly. The two followed Jackie into a large examination room with two tables. \"Well, here we go,\" Sarah sighed. \"I should be happier about getting an ultrasound at the same time as my best friend but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nervous too, it's okay,\" Britney smiled, hugging Sarah before crawling up onto the table and rolling up her shirt. Sarah joined her and Jackie started with her, rubbing gel onto Sarah's big belly and pressing the ultrasound wand against her roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your belly feels incredibly tight,\" Jackie said. \"Do you feel any discomfort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just...strong abs,\" Sarah blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would do it,\" Jackie smiled, flipping on the display and running the wand around. \"Just relax. This won't hurt at all. In fact, a lot of women find it soothing...men and women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah opened her mouth to question Jackie's last statement, but Jackie cut her off. \"There's one body...and another...and another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets?\" Sarah gasped, gripping the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" Jackie gulped, running the wand all over her belly. \"Looks like six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six babies?\" Sarah stuttered. \"At...at the same time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're seeing a lot of surprisingly large pregnancy sizes lately,\" Jackie nodded, patting her own belly. \"Twins and triplets are the norm. But don't worry, you're not the biggest patient I've had so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...good,\" Sarah said, her face burning red. She was a little excited about being pregnant but sextuplets? That wasn't quite what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now your turn,\" Jackie smiled, rubbing gel against Britney's equally huge belly and started taking an ultrasound. \"Looks like sextuplets over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Britney said, hand to her head. \"I mean, that's...wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you've got your friend to share the experience,\" Jackie smiled, looking between them both. \"I've had lots of people come in here, telling us they suddenly grew this big, baby-filled belly over the past few days and they've got no one.\" Jackie sighed, resting a hand on her own belly. \"Not that I'm all that different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're great, miss,\" Sarah said, pulling Jackie into a hug against her examination table. \"You're so kind and gentle and loving and you're an inspiration. I'll make sure one of my children become a doctor just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a nurse,\" Jackie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't hear you anymore,\" Britney said with a little smile. \"Sudden joy surge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, thank you,\" Jackie blushed as she slipped out of Sarah's grips. \"I'll just go get your doctor who will finish things up here.\" Jackie left the room and looked around. \"Dr. Pascat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment,\" Dr. Pascat said. She was the same gorgeous, brown haired woman who saw Diana yesterday. She was on the phone at the moment and was finishing up. \"So come in around 3?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would work best for us,\" Kate smiled, arm around Robin as she cuddled against her lover. \"But this is <u>your</u> campaign, after all. I haven't even met the people financing this. Not that I mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Dr. Pascat smiled. \"I'm glad you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I found another pregnant woman, just like you asked,\" Kate said, petting Robin's hair as she began kissing Kate's naked breasts. \"Red head, little aged and tired-looking. Perfect for the desperate market.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll see you this afternoon,\" Dr. Pascat said. \"This Xpect campaign will take your career places you never dreamed of.\" She hung up and waddled into Sarah and Britney's examination room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate put her phone on her bureau and turned her attention back to Robin. \"I missed you at the fashion show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounded like you needed some muscle,\" Robin laughed. \"Two pregnant friends of a friend ganged up on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I couldn't handle,\" Kate laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know I think pregnancy is kinda hot,\" Robin purred. \"Maybe I should have gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll love these women I'm working with for my latest campaign,\" Katie said, tracing her hand down Robin's curves. \"Maybe we can share them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Robin laughed, giving Kate one last kiss. \"But now, I better get up. I've got work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate sighed, rolling her eyes. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Robin said, furrowing her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just weird. You have this dead-end job and you're, what, 35?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"31,\" Robin said, ears turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"31?\" Kate said, making an exaggerated worried face. \"Well, you must drink too much. It dries out the face. Anyway, seems like you'd rather show up late to work. It can't remind you of anything good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gulped. \"Y-you're...hey, how about we go one last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Kate smiled, moving her arm around Robin. \"If that's what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina groaned as she struggled on the toilet, fishing around under her big belly. \"C'mon...c'mon...\" Finally, she lifted up the strip of plastic she bought at the pharmacy and saw that the end was wet. \"There we go. It's hard to know if you've peed on this thing if you've got a big belly in the way,\" Sabrina said, rubbing her roundness. \"Then again...most women probably don't use a pregnancy test when they look like me. They try to do it a little sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina paced around the bathroom as she looked at the tiny pink strip. She'd known she was looking bloated for a few days, but attributed it to the illness from Sarah's weird energy drink. But things changed when Kate told her what the advertising job was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for pregnant women of all backgrounds and looks,\" Kate smiled. When Sabrina had begun to look surprised and protested when Kate said, Kate acted just as surprised. \"Well, you've got the look. Warm, maternal, attractive. Perfect for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sabrina suspected Kate didn't just want a pretty face. And after another minute or so, she got her confirmation. \"I'm pregnant,\" she said to herself, looking at the changed strip. \"Oh...oh boy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nina panted as she struggled to even waddle through the gym to Emily's office. Her belly was a total beach ball, jutting out unbelievably far from the rest of her fit body. As she made her way into the office, her belly hitting the doorframe and making her wince a bit, the rest of the main MegaGym staff adjusting their seats to avoid her pregnant size. \"Um...I don't know where I should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a bigger seat for you over here,\" Emily sighed, pointing to a proper love seat she had some of the more muscular gym members dragged in. She couldn't exactly lift anything heavy in her current condition. As she stood up, a large bulge was clear under her usual grey spandex and she rested one hand against it gently. \"So that's everyone, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Sarah,\" Lori said, looking around. It was Emily, Nina, Lori, Terry, Jim, and Rebecca stuffed into the tiny office. And thanks to their swelling middles, especially Nina's, the space was more cramped than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah doesn't need to be here,\" Rebecca scoffed. \"It's her fault anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca,\" Emily scolded, letting out another long sigh. \"Getting angry or pointing fingers won't help anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this about?\" Jim asked, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called you all here because I have some...news,\" Emily said, shutting her eyes before she let it out. \"We're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long pause held over the room. Lori had long suspected something funny was going on with her belly but had been in denial. \"E-excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect makes you pregnant when you drink it,\" Emily said, head hung. \"I don't know how but I took a test today and, sure enough, I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit of a jump, don't you think?\" Jim said, letting out a little laugh. \"Congrats on the baby and all but that doesn't mean it came from the drink. Rebecca and Lori both drank Xpect and they're not...\" Jim narrowed his eyes as he looked at their stomachs. They were certainly wider and rounder than usual. Even more than yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <u>am</u> pregnant,\" Rebecca said, a smug smile on her face. She knew this would all go back to bite Sarah in the ass, since she's the one who gave out these drinks in the first place. \"And Lori, it looks like you've got quite a few on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLori's face kept getting paler and paler. \"I-I mean, I know I've been getting bigger and I felt something funny earlier today, but I don't think...\" As her voice trailed off, Lori buried her face in her hand. \"Oh my God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had some too,\" Nina said quietly. \"Do you think that's why I'm...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whale? Yes,\" Rebecca said. \"I'm surprised you haven't been more concerned. It's like you're a parade float and every day they pump you up again with a baby-sized puff of air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" Emily said loudly. The whole room went quiet and looked at the boss. \"I know this is scary and sudden, but we have to keep our heads attached. It's not like exercise and fitness go out the window when you're pregnant, after all. Nina knows that better than anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do still look pretty hot,\" Terry said, craning his neck to look at Nina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Nina giggled. \"You guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Jim said, hand against his temple. \"If anyone who drinks Xpect gets pregnant, does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been getting a little wide around the waist,\" Rebecca chuckled. \"Don't worry: girls think single dads are hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" Terry spat, looking down at his own bulging stomach. \"I can't believe this shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, c'mon!\" Emily yelled again. \"We can handle this. I doubt we're the only ones who drank this Xpect stuff and newly discovered they have a baby on the way...or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even know this Xpect stuff caused it?\" Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told her,\" Rebecca said with pride. \"I overheard Sarah talking with her other knocked up friend and she told her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sarah didn't know either?\" Nina said. \"And her belly was the biggest of all of you...poor girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she must be killing herself over this with guilt,\" Jim sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, don't you see? We're in this hole because of Sarah,\" Rebecca said, her smile fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should hold a party for her,\" Terry nodded. \"A 'we forgive you' and 'we're not angry' kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it could double as a baby shower,\" Lori chuckled. \"We might as well take this thing head on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all sounds good to me,\" Emily said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Rebecca said, shaking her head. \"This is crazy! This is her fault! She even gave it to other people at the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My business has never been better,\" Nina laughed. \"I could show you all some great ways to stay fit too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone chatted a little more happily as they left the office, smiles all around. Lori stayed behind to meet with Emily. \"Sarah makes everyone happy one way or another,\" Emily laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure does,\" Lori sighed. \"But what about the fitness competition in a few days? Xpect is still our sponsor. Do we drop them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bit her lip for a few seconds, sitting down to collect her thoughts. \"MegaGym is a lot closer to closing than I've let you all on,\" she said. \"But the money we're getting from Xpect...we'll be around for a lot longer. A <u>lot</u> longer. And this contest will keep us in the public eye for years to come too. We can't afford to drop Xpect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a good idea?\" Lori said, putting her hands on her belly. \"I'd hate for other people to have the same surprise as us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it'll be fine,\" Emily sighed. \"Besides, it tastes like shit. How many people could really drink it?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monica rested one hand on her belly as she looked herself over the mirror. When she woke up this morning, she was just bizarrely bloated and gave herself a quick, sad look. Now, thanks to Britney's text, Monica knew the truth: she was pregnant. That made her look at her body in a whole new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom always warned me I'd end up pregnant and single if I wasn't careful,\" Monica sighed, stroking her bare belly. Her light t-shirt was rolled up, letting her look at her swollen middle. Monica's looks only started to come in halfway through high school, but by then, she already knew it wasn't the football captains and track stars who asked her out that she was interested in. It was the head cheerleader. It was the quiet girl in the library. It was her English teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Monica ever approached any of them. In her small, rural town, it was hard enough for her being the only biracial student in her grade. If she also came out as a lesbian, she feared she'd never make it out of there. So she nodded silently when her mother told her to steer away from guys who would leave her with a baby on the way like Monica's father did. But all the while, Monica made sure to study and pour herself into track and field to qualify for a scholarship to an out-of-state school in the city. Then she stayed there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in college, Monica found her passion for modeling, but even with her fabulous face and beautiful body, she wasn't making it much further than a few odd local ads here and there. Until she met a young, attractive ad executive named Kate who offered her work in a long ad campaign. Kate became the first person Monica truly fell in love with, the first person she slept with, and the first mentor she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate molded and directed Monica perfectly, showing her how to dress around town to get the right kind of buzz and attention, how to look in photoshoots to make others remember her, and she even landed Monica her first job on a catwalk. Everything seemed to be going right in Monica's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all ended abruptly with Kate dumped Monica, telling the young model that she just wanted to have some fun and get an exclusive model for her campaigns. Unlike with Sarah, Kate never talked to Monica about the possibility of a family, which stung Monica even deeper in the days after the break-up. Monica knew it meant Kate never saw her as anything but a silly little girl to have fun with and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, now Monica had a baby on the way. Maybe more, given her size. She stroked her mocha belly a few times, her fingertips sensing fluttering movement that seemed to be coming from multiple sources. Not that she could really tell: the bodies were too small and it wasn't like Monica had ever been pregnant before. Monica also didn't know how far along she was supposed to be. It had only been five days, and unless she was growing a few thousand embryos in her womb, what was going on inside her was more than just a five-day pregnancy. She was months and months along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even after discovering that she was inexplicably pregnant, the happiness building up in Monica's chest wasn't going away. Her night with Sarah was one of her best nights in a long, long time. Not only because of her night modeling lingerie in her biggest job yet. Sarah was a light in Monica's life, even if they only spent a few hours together. Monica brought her fingers to her lips, reminiscing on the brief contact they made with Sarah's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two pregnant lesbians dating,\" Monica sighed. \"It's like a science fiction story.\" Her cheeks burned as she looked at her phone. Britney told her to talk to Sarah again. Monica had very little experience being in a relationship or trying to be in a relationship, but she had a feeling \"hey, by the way, I'm pregnant\" wasn't a great icebreaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Monica wanted to talk to Sarah again. So, so much. But as she reached for her phone, it started ringing. Monica picked it up and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica! Hi,\" Gisele said on the other end, her voice trembling. \"S-so did you get Britney's message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Monica sighed, turning back to face herself in the mirror, stroking her belly slowly. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this,\" Gisele whined. \"This is so crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's something else,\" Monica said, pressing her fingers against her bulge. She never imagined a pregnant belly would be so tight. Her English teacher was pregnant in high school but she wasn't adventurous enough to invite the class to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And right after my big break!\" Gisele grunted. \"Everyone saw me and I had it made! I'm so much hotter than most of the models out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Monica said, turning to see both sides of her belly. No stretch marks, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banks, Klum, Upton, Kerr, Campbell, all of them! I'm so much hotter!\" Gisele yelled again. \"And now...I'm a blimp and these brats and going to stretch me out even more when they slide out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica stopped to wince at the imagery. \"Don't be so hard on yourself, Gisele. When I saw you yesterday at the show, you still looked great...belly and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Monica. You're too sweet to be a model,\" Gisele said. \"Anyway, I called because I think we should get together and talk this over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a good idea,\" Monica said, slowly rolling down her shirt, only to see it stop halfway down her bulge. \"Where should the five of us go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the caf\u00e9 on Aldon Street but,\" Gisele's voice trailed off. \"It's only going to be us four. We don't trust Britney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney?\" Monica said, sitting down on her bed, the weight of her belly taking its toll. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you heard what people are saying?\" Gisele whispered. \"The energy drink, Xpect. It's what made us pregnant. People all over the city are getting pregnant like us from this stuff. I even heard some men are getting pregnant. And you know who gave us these drinks, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica gulped. \"B-but that doesn't make sense. Britney drank them too. She must have not have known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she wanted to get pregnant too. Maybe she has some kind of sick power fetish with pregnant women working under her. I don't know, but I don't like it and neither do Nico and Michelle,\" Gisele scowled. \"But we'll talk about that at the caf\u00e9. Meet us there in half an hour, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Monica nodded as Gisele hung up. Britney couldn't have intentionally made them pregnant...could she? Would she? Monica stood back up slowly, balancing herself with both hands on the small of her back. If Britney wasn't welcome at the meeting, she definitely couldn't invite Sarah. They'd think she was spying for her friend and roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Monica couldn't help at least reaching out to Sarah again. Looking at the number Britney gave her, Monica sent a text to Sarah. &lt;hi, it's Monica. Sarah gave me your number. Last night was fun&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sarah didn't respond, since she was still at the doctor's office, getting her first ultrasound and examination. Monica stared at her phone, waiting for a response before sighing and stuffing it back in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm alone and pregnant after all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Geoff put down his tray and stretched his arms over his head. The caf\u00e9 was much busier today than he ever remembered it being on a normal weekday. He wouldn't complain, thanks to the tips he'd get, but it took its toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geoff, someone else joined Table 13,\" Chad, one of the other waiters said. He had a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's hot, like the rest of them,\" Chad said, before gesturing a curve in front of his stomach. \"But she's also knocked up. Nothing new, obviously, but it would be nice if some sexy women would show up without a baby on the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff gulped. He wasn't exactly on board with Chad's sentiments. He was all too happy with the influx of pregnant customers the caf\u00e9 had seen lately, even if some of them were crabby and had a short temper with him. The baby boom wasn't only with the customers: one of the waitresses looked like she swallowed a basketball and Chad's stomach was getting a little wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if the new woman was anything like the other customers he had at Table 13, this shift wouldn't be as tiring as it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried outside, straightening out his shirt and trying to look as composed and cool as possible. \"May I get you something to drink, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tea, please,\" Monica said in a quiet voice, smiling back at Geoff before turning back to her fellow pregnant models. \"So...how is everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little better now,\" Nico said, looking at Monica. \"I thought my belly was too big, but now that I'm seeing you...well, I feel differently.\" Monica blushed and looked down. Michelle swatted Nico's arm with her menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nico! Jesus,\" Michelle said. \"Be a little compassionate. We're all in the same, weird boat. Besides, you're so tall and gangly, your belly looks smaller than all of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" Gisele grumbled as Geoff came back with Monica's tea. \"We aren't ready to order yet.\" Then she bit her lip and sighed. \"Who am I kidding? I'll take the bleu cheese burger, medium well, with a side of potato soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gisele?\" Michelle whispered. \"Isn't that a little...heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm eating for two...or three...or more, I don't know,\" Gisele said. \"All I know is I'm hungry and I want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll get the same,\" Monica said, her blush growing. After staring at their friends in disbelief and wiping the drool from the corners of their lips, Nico and Michelle put in similarly big orders and turned their attention back to the issue at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we really think Britney did this on purpose?\" Nico said. \"I wouldn't put it past her, given how much she pushed us before the last lingerie exhibition. But I just can't think of why she'd want to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have an answer to that,\" Gisele said. \"I've got lots of contacts in the industry and it sounds like Margaret D\u2019Anne and Roger Corgan are looking for some models for a pregnancy lingerie show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy lingerie?\" Michelle said. As Geoff walked by the table, he couldn't help but overhear. The blood rushed to his head so quickly he had to dart back inside before he collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele nodded. \"And they're paying a crazy big amount. I guess pregnant models are rare and ones who want to walk around in skimpy underwear are even rarer. I think Britney wanted that money and found a way to get some additional models to work on the contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean...if there really is a pregnant lingerie show and we do it, we'll get even more money?\" Monica asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but that'll go to supporting a lot of unexpected babies,\" Gisele scoffed, patting her belly before looking down at it. \"Then again...now that they're on the way, I guess I will need the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're keeping yours?\" Nico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele sighed and nodded. \"I come from a big family, so I might as well get this out of the way now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm keeping mine too,\" Monica said, hand rested against her belly. \"Although...no, it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...thought I'd have someone to raise the babies with, but that might not be the case now,\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ex, Kate?\" Nico said, reaching out to Monica's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's...someone else,\" Monica said. \"I met her after the show last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica!\" Gisele said with a surprised smile. \"It's been less than a day and you're already calling it quits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...she didn't respond to my text,\" Monica mumbled, looking down. The three women started laughing, reaching over to hold Monica's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetie,\" Michelle said, wiping a tear from her eye. \"You haven't had much experience with dating, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Monica said. \"Kate was my one and only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we've got something to take our minds off of this,\" Nico said, patting her belly. \"Tell us everything you can about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Monica said, looking between the three models anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not obvious? We're playing Cupid,\" Gisele smiled, leaning in, her swelling breasts brushing the table as she put her cheeks in her hands. \"Now c'mon. Details!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, her name's Sarah,\" Monica began, her toes curling as she thought about her last \"date.\" \"And...she's pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you-\" Sarah said before Dr. Pascat shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lie still, please,\" Dr. Pascat smiled. She knew what Sarah was trying to say: she was the woman from the Xpect commercial. And Sarah would have been right. \"Your babies look very healthy. Five months along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five months?\" Britney said, looking at her own gelled-up belly. \"It's only been a few days!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to go so fast, doesn't it?\" Dr. Pascat smiled, patting her own pregnant middle. \"Now for you.\" She started running the ultrasound wand over Britney's belly and smiled sweetly. \"Healthy too. That's been the good part of all the women who have come in with new pregnant bellies: everyone's healthy. It's a miracle, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah started to open her mouth, but Dr. Pascat was already by her side. \"But you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I spoke too soon,\" Dr. Pascat said, shaking her head. Quickly, she slipped some pills into a plastic cup of water and fed it to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-from the commersh...you knewbou' exxx,\" Sarah slurred, her eyelids getting heavy as her head fell back down against the examination table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fetal metabolism was a bit off,\" Dr. Pascat said. \"But that medication will make sure her babies are perfect when they're born. She'll be groggy for a few hours, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better you help now, I guess,\" Britney gulped. \"So when should we come back for a check-up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a few days,\" Dr. Pascat said, writing them both notes. \"But between you and me: everything looks good.\" She winked and put her hand on Britney's belly. \"Being pregnant is a joy. Treasure it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney quietly nodded as Dr. Pascat walked back outside, calling Kate again. \"You again,\" Kate smiled. \"I'm just about to leave to shoot the next rounds of commercials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good,\" Dr. Pascat said. \"I also left a sample of a new product in your mail. Why don't you give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Kate chuckled, finding a can in her mail. As she hung up, she looked over the can. \"Xtreme Xpect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Robin said, rubbing her eyes as she walked into the living room, naked except for her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a client,\" Kate said, opening the can and taking a whiff. She scrunched up her nose as the smell, much worse than Xpect's. \"Hey Robin...try this and tell me how it tastes.\"</span></div></div>",

They were going to be married, and hopefully soon, lest the two of them waddle down the isle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them 54 years old, lesbians, pregnant and getting married, starting a life together while new life mysteriously grew within them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, a tale as old as time\u2026 yadda yadda yadda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had so much to discuss, baby names, moving in together, when they should get married, who should come\u2026 All the major questions you want to ask after getting engaged to another pregnant woman you've gone on one date with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, across town, in the fanciest of fancy dining halls, The Hamilton's sat down together to enjoy dinner together as a growing family in what would go down in History as the definite definition of \"The Dinner from Hell\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was supposed to be a nice night out to celebrate Mrs. Hamilton's \"Big News\", became one of the most blogged about events in histories, with Laci being nearly naked, Maci pigging out, Mrs. Hamilton hiding her face in shame, and Mr. Hamilton coming face to face with his pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a scale of 1-10 in terms of epic dinner disasters this was a solid 100/10. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Cheers!\" Trisha Hamilton smiled as she lifted her glass of water. Laci and Maci reluctantly did the same, joined by David Hamilton. \"David, are you sure you don't want any wine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" her husband said, clearing his throat. \"I-If my lovely wife can't drink, neither will I.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha gave her husband a touched sigh and put one hand over his. \"You don't need to do that, honey. Besides, you never gave up alcohol when I was pregnant with these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't give it up either,\" Maci said callously, looking at her twin sister. \"The way one of us turned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking the same thing,\" Laci grinned evilly, glaring at her twin. Of course, to anyone who didn't know the Hamiltons, they would never have guessed these two girls were identical twins. Laci's hair was dyed completely black, the same color of her lips, fingernails, in stark contrast to the heavy pale makeup she had all over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy contrast, Maci's hair was platinum blond and curly, her whole body was covered in a strong tan, and today she had alternating blue and pink paint on her nails. Growing up with an actively occult sister, Maci was a bit superstitious and thought settling on one color would affect the sex of the twins currently developing in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake-up choices weren't the only way Laci and Maci looked different tonight. Maci had on a thick sweater with a light eggshell blouse, all in an attempt to make sure her pregnant belly was totally unnoticeable. At five months pregnant, Maci's stomach was no longer something a casual passerby wouldn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci had the opposite concern. The gothic mommy-to-be had on a leather tube top that was fastening in the front with string. Laci made sure this string was plenty loose so the maximum amount of cleavage was visible. The only other clothing she had on besides her shoes was a black lace skirt that barely concealed all of her increasingly plump rear. At one of the fanciest restaurants in the city, Laci was far from the dress code, but between the waiters who were enthralled by her near-nude beauty and the waiters who were terrified of this modern witch, no one said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" David said in a low tone, flashing his daughters a frustrated look. He was touchier now than he'd been before, for two reasons he didn't dare tell his family about. For one, the neighbor he'd slept with was now pregnant and seemed sure it was his. And two, he was 99.999% sure he was pregnant, just like his wife and children. How? He wasn't sure. A curse from Laci wasn't off the table, in his mind. But he'd heard some rumors of other men in town discovering that they were pregnant but never confirmed these cases for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, he'd convinced his wife that his growing belly was \"sympathy weight\" and a result of stress from trying to get the family a new house. He sighed and drank his water again, wishing he could still drink without concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Megan,\" their waiter said, smiling as she walked up to the family. Megan felt a little better about serving a table with so many pregnant customers, since she was also five months pregnant and a former member of Sarah's FemmeFit class, moving to Nina's class when she discovered her pregnancy. Megan also worked at the small bar and grill near Sarah and Britney and was trying to pick up more shifts at her other restaurants now that she knew just how many babies she had on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Megan,\" Trisha smiled. \"Glad to see a fellow mother-to-be.\" Trisha also noticed that Megan's belly was bigger than any of theirs but decided not to mention that. \"This is a celebratory dinner for us, so we're going to order a lot, I expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, what's the celebration?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got a new job,\" Trisha said, her smile growing and growing. \"Lab technicial at Trionic Chemicals. I've been wanting to get back to work now that these two are getting ready to leave the nest and,\" she laughed and patted her belly, \"let's just say the extra money is coming at the right time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\" Megan smiled. David nodded and gave a small, fake smile, his mind stuck on Tami Smith and whether she would tell Trisha about their relationship. Anyway she chose to take her secret, he knew she'd want him to pay to support her children. And after he just sank his money into the new house for the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family all ordered, with David getting an odd look from his wife when he ordered far more than usual. His weight gain was pointed out by Trisha the night before and he said he would make changes to start losing some of his belly. Laci ordered a large vegetarian dish, informing her family that she was trying out a new diet she found on a wicca website that would make her a more likely conduit for the world of spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maci got the biggest look of surprise when she ordered three full entrees and when she handed the menu back to Megan, her cheeks were bright red. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot to eat, sweetie,\" Trisha said, one eyebrow raised while she smiled at her daughter. \"Even if you're pr-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it!\" Maci yelped, biting her lip and she shifted in her seat. \"At least not out loud. I know I'm...\" she looked around before leaning back in to the table. \"pregnant. And pregnant women eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've got cravings, honey, but you don't give in to them all the time,\" Trisha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving into <u>all</u> of my cravings,\" Maci said. \"I'm trying to watch my figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you have a boyfriend now?\" Laci snickered, one hand constantly rubbing the pregnant belly she loved so much. \"Or maybe a girlfriend. We're identical twins, after all. It makes sense we'd have the same tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Maci said angrily, flashing her twin a scolding look. \"I may have an opportunity to be a...pregnant model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid picked the wrong time to start drinking his water and everyone in the restaurant looked over as he coughed and sputtered while Laci laughed out loud. \"You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci's blush spread to her entire face now. \"At the fashion show I went to, there were pregnant models and I asked around after and there's going to be an entire pregnant lingerie show in a few days. They said I could audition to be in it and didn't care if I was an amateur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lingerie?\" David yelled in surprise, wiping his face clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now,\" Trisha said, reaching over to her husband again. \"Maci's not a little girl anymore and...it's good to see you being more comfortable with your pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have Robin do a photoshoot of you,\" Laci cackled quietly to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their food arrived, talk about Maci's modeling decision fell to the wayside as all four Hamiltons ate with incredible vigor, Maci most of all. But amidst it all, Trisha kept pausing and looking at her family members' eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, dear?\" David asked, his mouth full of steak. \"Upset stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just noticed that our diets are a little out of whack lately,\" Trisha said. \"And our stomachs are getting much faster than a pregnant woman's really should. Especially you, Dave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, do you want us to start going on family jogs?\" David said, not liking his wife to draw attention to his five month belly. \"Join MegaGym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Trisha beamed. \"I signed us all up for MegaGym's athletics competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire restaurant looked over again as David, Laci, and Maci dropped their utensils onto their plates. \"Mom, you cannot be serious,\" Maci said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exercise? Sweating and running in a giant lit building surrounded by other bubbly fitness freaks?\" Laci said. \"It sounds awful. Besides, I'm pregnant. I don't think I'll be much of a competitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not about winning,\" Trisha said, shaking her head at her goth daughter. \"It's for fun! And for health! Besides, I was told that there were already lots of pregnant women entered. And David, it would be a good way to start trying to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was turning as pale as Laci as his wife told him about the competition but Maci and Laci were already debating it among themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat any more and you won't even be able to waddle, let alone run,\" Laci chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least I did cheerleading in high school. I didn't sit under the bleachers and read weird poems,\" Maci said. \"You'll collapse if you compete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have my girlfriend in the audience cheering me on,\" Laci replied, leaning in to Maci. \"Who will you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Laci,\" Maci snarled, standing up and facing her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even have friends who'd come see you?\" Laci said, standing up as well, her red contacts flashing as she stared into Maci's eyes. \"Or did they all leave you when they heard you were knocked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cry of anger, Maci thrust her belly into Laci's, knocking the half-naked pregnant girl into the closest table, spilling food everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, a little passion from you!\" Laci laughed, getting up and thrusting her own belly into Maci's knocking her into another table. When Maci stood up, her shirt was rolled up, showing off just how big her belly was. \"Ah, there's your bump you want to hide so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another yell, the two pregnant twin sisters continued wrestling and knocking over more and more tables and plates. Megan hurried out of the kitchen, looking at them in disbelief. \"What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll be taking the check now,\" David said, raising one hand as Trisha just watched her daughters in silent horror, hoping the twins in her belly got along better.</span></div></div>",

Think of it as...a light maternity leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do I need 'light maternity leave?'\" Diana asked, taking another step forward and making her octuplet belly bump into Richard's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one reason,\" Richard said, grabbing his knick-knacks as Diana's bump jostled the table. \"You work in a laboratory filled with very fragile equipment and our clients give us limited samples to work with. If you broke them, we would face a substantial loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana adjusted her glasses and fumed. \"It's more than a little insulting that you think pregnant women can't control their round stomachs and will just knock things over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Larsen, look at how large you've become in just the last few days,\" Richard said, lowering his voice and leaning in. \"I'm not going to pry into the medical condition that explains why your pregnancy is so...prone to growth spurts, but you clearly cannot adapt to your sizes from day-to-day and I have to think of the company.\" Richard ran his hands through his thinning hair as he felt Diana staring daggers at him. \"And that's another reason. Your pregnancy is so atypical, it can't be a bad idea to give you less strenuous work in an environment with less chance for injury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana crossed her arms against her breasts, the tiny application of pressure sending a surge of soreness and reminding Diana that she needed to go shopping for maternity bras soon. \"And what will you have me be doing? Am I going to be a receptionist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't be silly,\" Richard said. \"We don't want to squander your fantastic mind. We could always use another bright woman...I mean another bright scientist to look through journal papers and check proposals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The most boring job in the whole company</i>, Diana sighed to herself. \"Fine. I assume I'll have an assistant working with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, someone of your position should still have an assistant,\" Richard nodded. \"We've just hired a new lab technician and she'll be starting off with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new lab technician? I don't get to keep Thomas?\" Diana said, her voice getting louder with her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard cleared his throat and put his hands on his desk. \"No...Thomas will be taking over your in-lab projects.\" At this, Diana stormed out of the office, her hips clumsily swaying back and forth with her belly's weight. \"Dr. Larsen! Dr. Larsen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diana waddled as quickly as possible down the hall and back to her lab to get her things, she went past Thomas, whose face lit up when he saw his co-worker. \"H-hey, how did it go?\" Diana kept walking and his smile faded as he hurried to keep up with her. \"Diana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" she spat, throwing her things into her bag. \"You've project lead now. You've probably wanted that for a while, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Thomas said as Diana left, heading out the door. \"Diana?\" Thomas kept calling but eventually just sighed and went into Richard's office by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana felt her lips tremble as she got out her phone and called Britney. The two were at their apartment, sitting on the couch, marveling at their bellies as they rubbed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sextuplets,\" Sarah murmured, moving her hands in pace with the tiny movements she felt. \"I can't believe this is real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Britney sighed, slouching to allow her belly to jut up above her, both hands slowly moving around the entire slope of her occupied womb. \"Being pregnant was one thing but this...this is heavy.\" A kick to her bladder made Britney wince and shift in her seat. \"Literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her phone began to buzz, Britney groaned and tried to reach from her current position, not wanting to move too much with her huge belly. Finally she made it and answered the call. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney,\" Diana said, tears starting to flow as soon as she heard her friend's voice. \"Is Sarah with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, she's right next to me,\" Britney said, looking over at Sarah, who shot back a confused look. \"Is...everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana shook her head, even if her friend couldn't see. \"I need to come see you all. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Diana calculated, there are few bad moods that could not be aided by the embrace of Sarah Richardson. The sporty mom-to-be held Diana tightly, their bellies pressed tightly together as she swung her arms back and forth. \"Diana, you are the smartest, coolest, most confident, beautiful woman I know,\" Sarah cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Diana sniffled, holding Sarah back. \"But really, you didn't need to say it 50 times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's true!\" Sarah said. \"You're the smartest, coolest-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sarah,\" Britney said, tapping her roommate on the shoulder. \"Maybe...Diana would like to just sit and talk with us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's do that,\" Diana said, adjusting herself so Sarah could still cuddle her without suffocating Diana. \"But thank you. I don't know why I got so upset. Must be preggo-hormones, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't talk like that,\" Sarah pouted. \"You've worked so hard on your career and to get pushed out for having a few babies on the way is nonsense. Even if it's only temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" Britney said, smiling as she let out a long sigh. \"Sarah and I had our ultrasounds today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Diana said with a smile, patting her two friends' bellies. \"What's the prognosis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're definitely pregnant,\" Britney said, placing her hands on the top and bottom of her massive pregnant middle. \"And they all look healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'They?' So it's multiples?\" Diana said. She still hadn't told her friends just <u>how</u> pregnant she was, so it sounded like the three were about to surprise one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sextuplets,\" Sarah said, giggling. \"Can you believe it? We're each going to have six babies. That's insane, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Diana laughed back, patting Sarah's belly. \"Although it would be even crazier if you were carrying eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess we dodged a bullet,\" Britney laughed before stopping and turning to Diana. \"Wait, what do you mean...Diana...are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah jumped to conclusions first, sitting straight up, her eyes bugged out. \"Diana, oh my god! Are you serious?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Diana said, moving her hands back to her own belly. \"Octuplets, four months along. In no time, I'll eclipse both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah dove back into her vicegrip hug with Diana, making the blond scientist cough a bit. \"This is so amazing! I...I...I don't know what to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy,\" Diana smiled, patting Sarah on the back. \"Seriously, easy. We've got precious cargo in here.\" Sarah finally weakened her hug and Diana turned to Britney, her face pleading for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what'll make Sarah get a little less bold,\" Britney smiled. \"Tell us about your new friend you met last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a turtle retreating into its shell, Sarah slunk back to her spot on the couch and curled up, hands against her huge belly. \"W-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana was grinning too. \"I noticed her too. She looked cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Sarah said, her face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, what happened between you two?\" Diana said, putting one hand on Sarah's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just talked and ate. No big deal,\" Sarah whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really like her,\" Britney laughed. \"Any pictures? She's a model after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'l see for myself,\" Diana said, reaching for Sarah's phone and snatching it away in time. When she woke it up, Diana's eyes lit up. \"Oh my god, you've got a text from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah said, stealing her phone back from Diana. Her face looked like she'd just come back from two back-to-back marathons. \"Britney, did you give her my number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have~\" Britney grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the worst,\" Sarah whined, heaving herself up and doing a running-waddle into her bedroom to call Monica in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we did some good work today,\" Diana smiled at Britney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a pregnant cupid,\" Britney sighed, her smile shrinking a bit. <i>A pregnant cupid who can't get a date herself</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's nice to finally meet in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Dr. Pascat, the same doctor who gave Sarah her ultrasound, said, shaking Kate's hand firmly. Kate was tall but the brown haired doctor still stood a few inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, 'doctor' sounds so cold,\" Kate smiled as she moved closer to Dr. Pascat's face. \"Have a more friendly name I could call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeannie,\" Dr. Pascat said, a smile moving across her lips as she looked back at Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeannie. Cute name,\" Kate said as she started to walk around the studio. \"The rest of our talent for the new shoot should be here soon. But I had a few questions first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Jeannie smiled, using her same graceful, slow tone. \"But you understand there are some things I can't talk about. Xpect has a great deal of trade secrets surrounding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine so. You're a brand new product,\" Kate nodded, hands held behind her back. \"My first question is why you're using such a gradual advertising process? You want us to slip these commercials out on the internet subtly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like to generate a lot of talk,\" Jeannie said, standing still but following Kate with her eyes. \"And frankly, Xpect isn't for everyone. We'd rather people find out about us than the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Kate said. \"And you went with my company because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie chuckled. \"Because you do such good work, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate smiled and moved back toward the doctor. \"Jeannie, you flatter me. Now something else I wanted to know...have you ever actually tried Xpect yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie paused and locked eyes with Kate. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, you gave me a can of one of your new beverages,\" Kate said, taking out the empty can of Xtreme Xpect. \"And a close friend of mine tried it.\" Kate turned around to face the doorway. \"Robin babe, would you come in please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn waddled Robin, her pregnant belly sticking out far past her breasts, which had also grown considerably since the previous day. With her limited \"punk\" wardrobe of tank tops and vests, Robin's belly was completely exposed. It was larger than Sarah, Britney, and Diana's bellies combined, but was still totally smooth and glistening, with her popped-out navel long ago pierced drawing even more attention to her already considerable size. Despite usually looking tough, Robin's eyes were hung low and she was trying to appear less conspicuous, which in her present condition was very difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie smiled and turned to Kate. \"Looks like our latest drink was even more 'Xtreme' than we thought. Do you know how pregnant she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the doctor here,\" Kate chuckled. \"You tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do an ultrasound after the shoot, on the house,\" Jeannie said, leaning in to Kate. \"But it seems like you've picked up on what makes Xpect such an exciting new company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm willing to keep it our little secret,\" Kate smiled. \"I don't even want to know how your drinks can make people pregnant. I just want to keep getting those big checks for these ads. Besides, I know a few friends who've been 'blessed' thanks to Xpect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More and more every day,\" Jeannie smiled back. \"We're a growing business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate laughed under her breath as Robin waddled up to them. \"You don't really want me in the ad like this, do you Kate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do. You look great,\" Kate said, patting Robin's belly and kissing her on the cheek. \"Besides, you'll get paid handsomely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Robin sighed, looking down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Sabrina said from the entrance, slowly waddling in. \"Kate, there you are. Is this everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole team's here for the day,\" Kate grinned as she walked over and hugged Sabrina, feeling her belly press against her. It had definitely gotten bigger since Kate last saw her, but now she had a better idea of why. \"I like to keep a sparse set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Sabrina said, clearing her throat. \"I should let you know...I'm not sure if I'm the best person for this campaign right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What's wrong?\" Kate said in a very convincing sad voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found out that I'm...pregnant,\" Sabrina said, her head dropping as she looked at her belly. \"Although, look at me. It's obvious now, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're pregnant?\" Kate said, turning to Jeannie and smiling. \"I wouldn't have guessed. You look so good still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it?\" Sabrina said, lifting her head as Kate turned back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Kate said, wrapping one hand around Sabrina's waist while the other rested on her belly. \"They say if you look good during pregnancy, you'll have a girl. Seems to me someone has a baby daughter on the way.\" Robin fumed silently as she watched Kate tease Sabrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like more than one,\" Sabrina said quietly, feeling Kate's hands across her round stomach. \"So you won't want to use me in your ads now, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, of course we can still use you!\" Kate said, moving Sabrina back toward the rest of the group. \"This is Jeannie. She's with the company doing the advertising and she'll appear in the commercial as well. And this is Robin, who will operate the camera and star alongside you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nice to meet you,\" Sabrina said, trying to act composed despite her shock at seeing Robin's belly size. \"That's...quite the prop belly you have there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate casually elbowed Robin. \"Thanks, it feels so life-like,\" Robin said, forcing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, places,\" Kate smiled, rubbing her hands together eagerly. \"Sabrina, let's start with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina nodded and stood in front of the backdrop Kate had already set up. \"Robin, you're going to shoot while wearing the prop belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at Kate and saw a flash of intimidation in her eyes. \"It's hard to get back on once it's off,\" Robin lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget the product,\" Kate smiled, handing Sabrina a can of Xpect. \"And...action!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh you know, fine,\" Sarah said, feeling a sharp kick from inside her belly. \"Quiet, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, not you!\" Sarah said, her hand trembling. She was usually so clear-headed and calm, but talking to Monica was different. \"No, yes, you!\" She paused again. \"It's kind of hard to talk over the phone, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Monica laughed. \"Would you like to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk...in person?\" Sarah said, slowly finishing Monica's sentence. Both women blushed brightly at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to,\" Monica said. \"Would you like to get dinner while we're at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be great,\" Sarah said, a smile growing across her face. \"Do you know the Sprout House? Let's meet there in, like, 15 minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Monica smiled, her voice trembling now. \"R-really looking forward to seeing you again, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Sarah said, hanging up before groaning loudly. \"Ugh, I should have said 'you too!' I'm so stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not stupid, Sarah,\" Diana called from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you hear?\" Sarah asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that last bit when you yelled,\" Britney answered. \"How did it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Sarah said, tearing through her closet to change into something that still made her extremely pregnant body look flattering. \"I'm meeting her soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you made an appointment on today's <i>date</i>?\" Diana smiled, leaning toward Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, we're just going to talk and eat at the Sprout House,\" Sarah said, her face getting redder and redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear they have new fruit and grain bowls,\" Britney grinned. \"Get one with lots of <i>dates</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you guys!\" Sarah whined, running awkwardly out the door as her belly bounced around. Britney and Diana laughed loudly as she shut the door behind her before sighing and rubbing their own bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for her,\" Diana smiled. \"I've wanted Sarah to be with someone again since Kate messed her up so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Monica's a good girl,\" Britney nodded. \"But I may not be looking forward to having a roommate in a relationship. I went through that in college and it was terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to make you feel worse, but you're also the only one in the Three Musketeers without a partner,\" Diana sighed, patting Britney on the shoulder. Britney turned to Diana and looked at her in disbelief. \"Easy, easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're seeing someone?!\" Britney yelped. \"When did this happen? After the belly? Before the belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After,\" Diana nodded. \"It's pretty recent. His name's Thomas and...well, we had a little spat when I got my downgrade, but I've cooled off and I can't wait to see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is...<u>it</u> while you're pregnant?\" Britney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't had sex yet,\" Diana sighed, running both hands up and down her belly. \"Looking forward to it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm the only one among us who's pregnant and single,\" Britney groaned. \"You wouldn't happen to know any guys who have a thing for cows, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look super hot,\" Diana said, resting her head on Britney's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you look hot pregnant. I'm just a balloon,\" Britney sighed before turning to Diana. \"Actually...you really do look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks,\" Diana said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean...I've been tasked with putting together a pregnant lingerie show. My models are all, thanks to that stupid energy drink, pregnant too but I don't know how many will still want to do this show. Plus, it'll be bigger so I'll need more models anyway,\" Britney said. \"Interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana sat up and looked Britney in the eyes as she thought it over. \"You know what? Yes, I'll do it. I have this downtime with my job, and damn it, I look good pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Britney laughed, hugging Diana tightly. \"That's such a weight off my shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not off your hips,\" Diana chuckled. \"I just hope I don't pop before the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be soon. Just three days away,\" Britney nodded. \"We'll do our first practices tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I'm here, why don't you show me how to catwalk?\" Diana said, heaving herself from the couch and stretching out her back, making her big belly jut out all that much more. \"Or at least how to waddle sexily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't need many pointers on that part,\" Britney laughed. \"But sure, I'll teach you how to walk like a model. Good looks aren't everything on the runway, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped as she saw Monica waddle toward her, wearing a pearl sweater that left most of her belly exposed and a pair of jeans. \"H-hi,\" Monica said, her dark, freckled face blushing. \"Nice to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Sarah nodded, waddling over. The two awkwardly hugged, their bellies rubbing together. \"Sorry, I usually give better hugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There'll be other chances,\" Monica giggled. \"Let's get a table.\" The two women got seated at a booth in the back, which gave them privacy but also pressed them together tightly. \"So...how was the gym today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't at MegaGym today,\" Sarah said. \"I got my...ultrasound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hadn't already gotten one?\" Monica said in surprise. Then again, she didn't have one yet either. \"So how did it look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything was good. Babies are healthy,\" Sarah smiled, placing one hand on her belly. \"All...six of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six?\" Monica said with a shocked cough. \"I guess that's why you're so big for four months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five months now,\" Sarah sighed, leaning in to Monica. \"Can I ask you something secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica nodded and leaned in. \"Only if I can ask you something too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah agreed. \"Are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Monica said. \"Did you drink Xpect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Sarah said, her jaw dropping. \"So you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just learned today,\" Monica sighed, rubbing her big brown belly. \"And to be honest, the other models think Britney knew ahead of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, she didn't,\" Sarah said, shaking her head. \"In fact...it's my fault she got the drink in the first place. So it's my fault you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica paused and looked down at her massive pregnant bump. \"No, you didn't know. I'm not mad.\" She looked up and smiled. \"I get to work as a pregnant lingerie model now, which I hear gets a lot of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you model that,\" Sarah smiled and laughed before burning up again. \"I-I didn't mean it like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's okay,\" Monica nodded quickly. \"I-I know what you meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hesitated before turning to Monica again. \"A-actually...I did mean it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's eyes opened wide as their waiter put their orders in front of them. Both women scarfed their leafy meals down in a flash. \"No offense, Sarah, but this didn't fill me up very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Sarah said. \"I'm craving tacos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lots of cheese,\" Monica nodded. They placed money on the table and waddled out as quickly as they could. As they walked, their bellies and hips touched each other and Monica stopped halfway there. \"T-this is my apartment, you know,\" Monica said. \"We could always...order some take-out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Sarah said. The two women waddled up the stairs and Monica hadn't even gotten her door open before they were touching and holding one another, their lips gently brushing against their warm skin. \"Y-you'd better call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Monica said as she opened her door. As soon as they entered, Sarah began kissing Monica all around her neck and shoulders, making Monica whine out loud and pant. They stumbled to Monica's bedroom and got down to their underwear, stroking bellies and kissing every exposed inch of skin. Monica made a trembling phone call to the nearest Mexican restaurant for takeout and the two rolled around (literally, thanks to their bellies) in bed after, discovering that their enormous middles made for very sensitive and wonderful places to kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both lay in each other's embrace, the doorbelly rang. \"I'll get it,\" Sarah smiled, kissing Monica on the nipple before wrapping the blanket around her own naked body and waddling to the door. The delivery girl looked at her in shock as Sarah paid and took the big bag of food. When the door closed, she dropped the blanket and entered Monica's bedroom in the nude, belly sticking out and a big parcel of cheesy takeout in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dream come true: a beautiful pregnant woman come to serve me tacos,\" Monica giggled. As Sarah waddled closer and started feeding her new girlfriend, Monica stopped her for a second. \"Actually...would you want to be in the pregnant lingerie show too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Sarah said, biting her lip. \"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gorgeous. Why wouldn't you be in it?\" Monica said, kissing Sarah's belly. \"And Britney's your friend so I'm sure she'd let you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will,\" Sarah smiled, joining her new lover in bed. \"Plus I'll get to see you up-close in those skimpy little outfits.\" Monica cooed and tackled Sarah again and they pulled the blanket over top of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Like this?\" Diana sighed, pivoting on the balls of her feet as she looked at Britney with an exasperated look. She strutted slowly through the apartment, trying to toss her hips like her friend showed her, making sure she could sense where her feet were stepping despite her pregnant obstruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a real catwalk, you won't look as annoyed,\" Britney chuckled, one hand stroking her pregnant stomach as she watched Diana move. \"And you still aren't moving right. It's like you're a dinosaur clomping around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the biggest belly on the-\" Diana began to groan, remembering what Nina looked like. \"Of any of your models, right? I'd like to see you with a bump this size and still strut your stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon you might get your wish,\" Britney sighed, expecting her stomach to add another handful of inches to its diameter when she woke up in the morning. \"But try to, I don't know, use your belly to your advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, wiggle it around?\" Diana said, lowering her glasses to stare at Britney. \"I don't think that would go over well and I think the octuplets would protest the move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just...\" Britney sighed, looking for the words. \"You know, show off your size. Like the bigger the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you just say you thought you looked like a cow?\" Diana smiled. \"This is quite the change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney ran her hands through her hair. \"I mean, on you and Sarah and the other girls, sure, pregnancy looks good, but that's not what I'm trying to say. On the runway, it's all about energy and gravitas. You need to show that the stage is yours and you need to try and do it through belly size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show I own the stage through my massive pregnant gut?\" Diana mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you won't do it by showing off how small your belly is,\" Britney laughed as her phone buzzed. \"Hang on just a second.\" Britney groaned as she leaned her weight to one side so she could reach into her pocket. That was another struggle in itself as her belly (and her butt, which was growing alongside her womb) made her pants tighter on her hips. But she managed to remove her device and stared at the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an all-too-long period of silence, Diana got worried. \"Britney? You...you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-m-\" Was all Britney could say over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, is it the hospital? Is Sarah in trouble? Family issues?\" Diana said, waddling close to Britney, putting one hand on her shoulder. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-money,\" Britney said in a dumb voice, looking over at Diana. \"Money, Diana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a good way or a bad way?\" Diana asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I knew I was told this next show would get an advanced payment but...\" Britney gulped. \"I didn't think it would be that much.\" Then Britney did something she didn't know she could still do: she jumped up from her seat and hopped up and down. \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that much?\" Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm rich compared to my current living situation! I'm rich compared to my current living situation!\" Britney chanted instead. \"We have to celebrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebrate?\" Diana laughed nervously. \"What, like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out. We're going out,\" Britney stammered, her face turning red as she grabbed Diana's wrist. \"You and me, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Diana said. \"We can't exactly go to the bar and drink, in case you'd forgotten.\" Diana ran her hands against Britney's belly to make her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll just act wild,\" Britney said. \"Let's be bad bitches, come on. No one will say anything because we're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana sighed. \"I guess I need to let off some steam from the bullshit at work. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play it again! Play it again!\" Britney yelled, sloppily dancing in place near her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney, you put Shania Twain into the jukebox 15 times in a row,\" Diana smiled, putting her hand on her friend's shoulder. \"It'll play again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh buh ba dah da buh buh,\" Britney belted out, turning to Diana dramatically and mouthing along with the music, \"Let's go girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long day, ladies?\" the bartender smiled at them. Most rowdy customers made the pub pretty annoying but when they were both gorgeous and heavily pregnant, well, it made things a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got fired and I got paid!\" Britney laughed, raising her fists in the air. \"Drinks for everybody! Except us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers filled the restaurant as the bartender started handing out beers while a waitress gave Diana and Britney a glass of pineapple juice. \"Thanks, and for the record, I wasn't 'fired,'\" Diana said. \"Just...moved for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" the waitress smiled, winking as she moved one hand to her own belly. Compared to her own octuplet stomach and Britney's globe-like middle, Diana had completely missed their server's motherhood. \"I got pregnant when I was at my last job and this is the only place near my apartment that let me work while I swelled up. Though I sure wasn't planning on this second pregnancy...or having twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sneaks up on you, doesn't it?\" Diana smiled, taking a long sip of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this place is preggo-friendly! I like it!\" Britney blurted out. \"You're all invited to my pregnant lingerie show. That's right, we're underwear models! Get a good look!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney's outfit barely covered her belly as it was, but she did everything it took to show it off even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend thinks pregnant tummies are sexy but I don't buy it. Does anyone think this looks good? Am I hot? Cute? Pretty?\" Britney's eyes scanned the bar. \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me?\" one young man at the bar said, his cheeks bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw you looking at me,\" Britney said, thrusting her bare stomach against his hips. \"What, you think I'm gross or you think I'm hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know if this is appropriate,\" the man quietly said, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry, there's no jealous dad in the picture,\" Britney said, rubbing her belly again. \"Who's right, my friend or me? Does my belly look hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">y-yeah</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought, I-\" Britney stopped and turned back, her \"money delirium\" fading a bit. \"Wait, seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the man said, his face getting redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Britney said, slowly rolling her shirt down. \"I'm...Britney by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle,\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, um, do you want to go to my apartment?\" Britney said. \"I'm a little hyper right now and if I let this opportunity go, I'd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way,\" Kyle said emphatically. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana watched in shock as Britney and her new possible partner darted out of the restaurant. She hesitated for a moment, biting her lip, before whipping out her own phone and dialing quickly. \"Thomas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana?\" Thomas said on the other end, a little confused. \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, depends,\" Diana said. \"Any plans tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cancel them. I'm coming over,\" Diana said, hanging up and heaving herself from her seat, moving as quickly as she could.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laci and Maci both sat on their beds, legs crossed and pouty lips doing exactly what they do best: pouting. Their growing twin-filled bellies rested in their laps, a few hours away from expanding into Day 6. Even if the two Hamilton daughters weren't in the room, it was easy to tell whose side was whose. Maci had various magazines strewn across her carpet, her desk was covered in make-up packets and brushes, there were brightly colored clothes spilling out of her drawers, and there was a thick, cute teddy bear resting on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci, on the other hand, had her walls painted black, creating a clear line showing where one girl's side began and ended. Her floor was covered in clothes she didn't bother putting into a hamper, her desk had journals and books about the occult and multiple jewelry cases for CDs and cassette tapes \u2013 digital music wasn't \"cool\" enough for her \u2013 and her bed was just a stripped down mattress on the floor, some melted candles in the carpet near it, remnants of old ceremonies she held to give herself powers or, as of late, a demon baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls' hair, Laci's dyed black hair and Maci's bleached blonde locks, had bits of food still in them after their spat at the restaurant earlier that night. The two of them fighting wasn't exactly something new but now that they were both heavily pregnant, it upset their parents enough to actually put them in time-out, which they hadn't done since they were in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Laci rolled over on her mattress and grabbed a CD player, hooking up the bootleg headphone doubler so both she and her fetuses could listen to blisteringly loud metal music. Maci sneered, able to hear it even through the headphones. She took the time to take out her cellphone from between her breasts. Her parents, Trisha and David, thought they'd confiscated it for the night but Maci just gave them an empty purse. Now, Maci was sure she wanted to differentiate herself from her family and especially her sister and take part in the maternity lingerie show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci dialed up Britney's number and rocked back and forth, rubbing her growing stomach as the other end rang. But Britney did not pick up, currently preoccupied at her new \"friend\" Kyle's home, figuring out the best way to fool around in bed with her pregnant belly in the way. Maci tried a few more times before giving up and just sending her a text. After, she darted over to the website for \"Soft Lace\" to see if there were photos from the last runway show. To her surprise, there were already pregnant women modeling the lingerie and they were all...gorgeous. And even bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;If they can be that big and still model&lt;/i&gt; Maci thought to herself, cupping one palm against her gut, &lt;i&gt;then...I can really do this.&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci opened one of her eyes and glared at her sister. As twins, they had a bit of a connection and Laci felt Maci's mood souring the room. And she felt a little cramped anyway, like she was back trapped with Maci in the womb. Laci pulled her phone out of her cleavage, adopting the same trick as her sister, and called Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" Robin said. Laci was taken aback some. She'd never heard her girlfriend so...subdued. And timid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin, babe, I'm bored,\" Laci purred, tracing one finger around her navel. \"Come save me? I can sneak out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fit out the window?\" Robin asked. Normally that would be a barbed joke but it sounded more genuine. Laci's curled black lips relaxed back into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I can. Don't be a pussy. We can fool around some,\" Laci said, looking over at Maci as the two twins made nasty faces at one another. \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are...that might not...\" Robin said, letting out a sudden groan. \"Oh god, was that a kick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kick?\" Laci repeated before she heard the phone moving around as a new woman's voice came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this? Robin has booty calls?\" Kate said with a cackle. \"She's a little tied up, sweetie, and she's gonna be tough to ride for a...hmm, not sure how long. She looks like she could drop any day now.\" Laci heard the faint sound of a spank and Robin yelping in the background. \"Anyway, she's busy. Maybe tomorrow, you can call her and the three of us could have some fun. We'll see.\" Kate laughed again and passed the phone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin?\" Laci squeaked, her body curling up. A click on the other end stopped the conversation and Laci looked at her phone in shock. Maci was looking over, her body relaxed some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci?\" Maci said, gulping. \"Are...are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something truly amazing happened. More than both girls spontaneously becoming pregnant. More than even their father becoming pregnant. Laci hugged her sister. With every scrap of energy, she moved her heavy, swelling form over and dove into Maci's arms, sobbing and wailing. Maci sighed and tightened her arms around Laci's waist, cradling her back and forth in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, let it out,\" Maci cooed. When she delivered her twins, how many nights like this would she have when they hit their teenage years? Maybe she could be a mom after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's cheating on me! The fucking bitch is cheating on me!\" Laci cried out, getting her dark makeup all over Maci's shirt. Maci hoped her teenagers wouldn't talk like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh,\" Maci said, petting her sister's dyed hair. She didn't want their parents to come in and get involved. Best to keep this between twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of twins and their parents, Trisha was in the living room, one hand on her belly as she looked at her size with astonishment. \"This big already. I was this big when I was halfway done with Laci and Maci and it hasn't even been a week.\" She lifted her shirt and patted her bare, tight stomach. \"Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've looked. I've seen,\" David said, intently looking at his newspaper instead, particularly the metro section. The housing market was starting to heat up in the area now that more people seemed to be having babies. If he didn't get their dream home settled, it might slip through their fingers once and for all. The other reason he didn't look up at his wife's belly was because it reminded him of his own. How much longer could he pass off that he was just fat? David didn't know...well, anything about male pregnancy but he assumed the babies would come at some point. Trisha would likely notice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was annoyed by his lack of attention and dropped her arms. \"Maybe I'll go across the hall. Talk with Tami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got David to look up. \"W-w-why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? She's pregnant too and has questions,\" Trisha said, giving her husband a funny look. \"She's about my age when I had Laci and Maci and looks like she's got twins too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gulped. Tami was, as things seemed, pregnant with his babies after their \"deal\" for him to give her a piece of the real estate market. Having her and his wife chat might not work out so well for him. \"Hey, come on, stay in,\" David said, putting down the paper and stretching out his arms. \"The girls are in their rooms and aren't coming out for a while...you and I could...you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha smiled and curled up in David's lap, stroking his cheek. \"Well, that might be nice. We don't have to worry about birth control I suppose.\" David laughed nervously and leaned forward to try and kiss his wife. I say \"try\" because their bellies were bumping together, stopping their progress. \"You really need to lose weight, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. That's why we're going to MegaGym, isn't it?\" David said. As he tried to joke around, Trisha pressed one hand into his stomach, feeling its firmness. Her eyebrows furrowed, confused by what she felt. Then something else got her attention: a flicker of movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I feel kind of tired,\" Trisha said, stretching out her arms. \"I may just go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You've got a lot of work,\" David said, placing his hands on her belly. \"At Tritonic and in here.\" Trisha chuckled and got off of her husband, heading to the bedroom. In the bathroom, she stripped down and touched over her stomach, noting its similar firmness and size to David's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had heard rumors of some men becoming pregnant, specifically a scientist from her old job who also worked in chemicals. He was a regular at MegaGym and that's where she'd first heard recommendations for it. He also suspected he might be pregnant, with him and his boyfriend very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran down Trisha's back as she tucked herself into bed, putting it all together with what little information she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;David is pregnant&lt;/i&gt; she thought. &lt;i&gt;He's pregnant from an affair...with another man&lt;/i&gt;.</span></div></div>",

Both softly smiled at the other as they opened their eyes, Monica's eyes glancing down at their pregnant stomachs, now lifting up the bedsheets to reveal their bare curves. \"We got bigger,\" Monica said in her still-drowsy lilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems to be the way it's going,\" Sarah said, throwing the blanket off so they could both see their full nakedness. They lay facing each other, belly-to-belly, with one hand on the other's forearms. Now that they were awake, Sarah moved her hands closer to Monica's chest, stroking it gently. \"These are bigger too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" Monica giggled, shifting forward to hug Sarah again, her face now in between Sarah's breasts, kissing her athletic lover with her big lips. Sarah pet Monica's soft, short brown hair before lifting her chin so she could begin to kiss her model girlfriend on the cheeks. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissing you on each of your freckles,\" Sarah murmured, pecking Monica all over her light brown skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be there a while,\" Monica chuckled, rolling around to rest her back against Sarah, letting her wrap her firm arms around Monica. Sarah sighed and gave Monica one last kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll pick that up later. I won't forget where I left off,\" Sarah said, slowly swinging her heavy body out of bed. \"Time to do my morning run anyway.\" As she waddled from her bed to her drawers and struggled to bend over with her heavy middle (though Monica was plenty pleased with the view when Sarah attempted it), Sarah had a sudden spark of an idea and twirled around to face Monica. \"You should come running with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning glow on Monica's face quickly vanished. \"Uh...I dunno about that...hey, how about you come try and count my freckles again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, running is soooo much fun!\" Sarah said, her grin starting to get wider than her face. She was in full \"Sarah\" mode now. \"You're new so it might be tricky but after the fifth mile, you'll be hooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't this,\" Monica said, placing her palm on her belly and pressing into her firm skin, \"kind of get in the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been running,\" Sarah shrugged. \"It's harder, sure, but I still get it done.\" Monica opened her mouth to try and protest but Sarah had already changed into her running gear with remarkable speed given her size. She abandoned wearing any kind of coverage for her belly and only had on a cozy sports top that held her growing chest in place and a pair of shorts with the elastic waistband getting as much of a workout as the woman wearing it. \"You didn't wear a sports bra to our date by any chance, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Monica squeaked. Her shy nature was not doing her any favors now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I can just borrow one from Britney,\" Sarah said, darting out of the room and into the rest of the apartment. \"Yo, Britney! Brit~ney!\" She looked around, frowning as she saw how empty the apartment was. She'd expected Diana to stay over after she got not-fired but she wasn't here either. Monica waddled out, wearing her underwear and a t-shirt that only covered her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\" Monica asked. Sarah's chipper attitude has noticeably gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My roommate isn't here and...she wouldn't have left for work yet,\" Sarah said, grabbing her phone and quickly calling Britney's number. After four rings, someone picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Britney slurred as she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRITNEY, IT'S SARAH! ARE YOU OKAY!\" Sarah shouted, in full panic mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Britney replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's loud,\" Kyle said on the other end. As soon as Sarah could hear his very-clearly male voice come through, her eyes bugged out and she hung up in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything...okay?\" Monica asked, rubbing her belly as she looked back at Sarah curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good,\" Sarah said with a growing smile as she began to stroke her stomach as well. \"I just think that we may not have been the only two who had a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's freckled face turned a little red. \"O-oh,\" Monica said. \"Should I say anything when I see her at work or keep it a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would jump into her arms and ask her a million questions but Britney does not always appreciate my approach,\" Sarah said with a shrug. \"But the good news is, Britney does not lock her room and I know where her clothes are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Monica said, getting a pit in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Kyle's apartment, Britney was still laying in bed as he walked over with a plate of toast. She chuckled and rolled over, grabbing a piece and getting crumbs on her naked breasts and belly. \"Thanks,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Kyle said, sitting down beside her. \"So, um, about last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a good time,\" Britney said, smiling. \"I mean, it wasn't exactly a date but I'm not running off after this, dude. Don't worry. I'm not big on one-night stands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Kyle said, with a nervous laugh. \"So that wasn't caused by a, um, one-night stand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney looked at him confused before looking down at her pregnant middle and snorted a laugh, putting her food down. \"Ah, no. Long story. Short version: if you see an energy drink called Xpect, don't drink it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I'll hear the rest of that some day,\" he said, crawling back into bed and cuddling close to Britney. \"But is there a dad in the picture I should worry about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're getting kind of flaky,\" Britney sighed, attempting to heave herself out of bed. \"A little help?\" Kyle gave her butt a firm push and she slid her legs off the bed, struggling to get upright. \"Kinda risky help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Kyle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney sighed and stood up straight, putting her hands into the small of her back and stretching out, accentuating her belly in the process as the sunlight came through the window and illuminated her naked body. Kyle gulped and felt his erection tightening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's no father in the picture. Would be easier if there was,\" Britney sighed, placing one hand on top of her swollen stomach and rubbed softly. She looked back at Kyle, his eyes wide and his face blushing. \"You really think this is sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kyle said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This a sexy pose?\" Britney repeated, pushing her back out a little more, making her hips pop and her belly seem even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" Kyle choked out, rushing out of bed to Britney, covering her body in kisses. \"Yes, yes, you have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a clue,\" Britney chuckled, reaching down and grasping his member. \"C'mon, one more time before I have to go to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kyle moaned, letting them both fall back into the bed. \"W-what's your job, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney laughed and grabbed Kyle's chin so he was looking right into her eyes. \"Lingerie model.\" Kyle hesitated before moaning again and throwing the blanket over top of them as Britney began to squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, everything I will do will be research on Xpect,\" Thomas said as he was getting dressed. Diana sat on the lip of the bed, arms crossed and resting on top of her belly. At five months with octuplets, she had now overtaken Sarah and Britney in size despite starting behind them. Her belly was so big her lap could not contain it and her legs were forced apart as the quivering mass of firm, smooth, round skin lay there, dominating her body. Her belly button ached, popped out of her stomach like a thumb on a hitchhiker, her skin so tight she thought it might actually split and give a look inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad,\" Diana said in a very mad tone. Thomas had taken her position at Tritonic, a position she'd worked for years to get but her extreme pregnancy sidelined. \"This is only temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, it's only temporary,\" Thomas nodded. Diana groaned again, hoping he'd get the clue that she was not as happy about things. Once she gave birth, she'd have eight newborns to take care of at once. Did he think she'd be able to get back into her job like that? Then again, it could be worse. Diana had a nightmare the company would start running studies and tests on her, Diana's coworkers now poking and prodding her naked, swollen body as she got bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll know where I am: down the hall reading a million different journal articles,\" Diana sighed, pushing herself off of the bed and waddling toward Thomas, pushing him with her belly. \"Come see me sometime. Maybe bring me something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Thomas said quickly. His relationship with Diana was new and he didn't want to jeopardize it. And he definitely didn't want to piss off an enormous pregnant woman. \"Love ya,\" he said, kissing her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, love you too,\" Diana said, holding onto his arm as he tried to leave and pulling him in for a real kiss. Things were awkward but...she did like him. She didn't know why but she did. Hormones, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any word on your coworker?\" Thomas said as he fixed his tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some middle aged woman who hadn't worked in a while. She's got a degree and she's returning to the workforce,\" Diana said with a shrug. \"Trisha Hamilton, they said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of her but...try to be nice,\" Thomas said. \"She's there to help, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always nice,\" Diana grumbled, stroking the sides of her humungous belly. At five months/days, she was beginning to feel some flutters of movement. It was a strange sensation. As Thomas left his apartment, Diana sighed and headed for the shower. \"Okay...let's see how this goes when I can't see my legs.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were a lot of strange rumors in the city. A mysterious energy drink commercial that named viewers by name, leaving no record behind. Reports of men who were actually pregnant. But the most bizarre was that one day, two women with enormous, round bellies went running through the streets with barely anything on to cover their pregnant bellies. Those who didn't see it swore it could never happen and those who did questioned their own sanity too much to swear its authenticity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Monica knew the truth. The burning in her muscles and joints was so intense and extreme, she would never forget it even if she wanted to. The freckled model wheezed and panted like a sick dog back at Sarah's apartment, sucking down bottle after bottle of water while she stroked her sweaty belly, its dark tan bulge now shiny and sleek. She looked over at Sarah as she waddled over with a towel and a replacement bottle. Sarah had the same sweaty look but also had a radiant, invigorated glow about her, brimming with energy. By contrast, Monica could barely keep her head up and had a haggard look under her eyes. She was still gorgeous, just a bit...frumpier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job out there,\" Sarah said, handing Monica a towel and more water. \"Most people don't make it the full 10K.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what can I say?\" Monica said, trying to laugh before feeling a pinching pain in her lungs. \"I wanted to stick it out with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's okay. If you'd ask to cut down, I would have. It was your first time, after all.\" Sarah turned back to the kitchen as Monica groaned. Then she spotted Sarah's plump butt in her tight shorts and remembered what kept her going on the run. \"So do you have to go into work today? I don't know what a model's schedule is like.\" Sarah blushed at her words and wiggled in place a bit. A model. She was actually dating a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends on what work I have but we all have to return to Soft Lace later today. There isn't much turn-around on the pregnant lingerie show and we're all...still getting used to being pregnant,\" Monica said, putting both hands on her belly and pushing them forward slowly. She could feel just how much bigger she was since yesterday. Before, she might have been able to reach her belly button but it was out of reach now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can shower here,\" Sarah said, pointing to the bathroom with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica bit her lip and waddled forward, touching her navel against Sarah's. \"Um, do you think your shower could fit two big pregnant women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually shower after work at MegaGym because I work up such a-\" Sarah started to say before looking into Monica's eyes and seeing the eager look on her girlfriend's face. \"...you know what? Let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's firm back smacked against the porcelain wall of her shower as she and Monica kissed, the warm water falling down on their naked, round bodies. They struggled for room, both for their bellies and their feet, but the dance was all part of the fun. Once soaped up, their pregnant forms slid and slapped against one another, making big sudsy clouds when they pressed together. Sarah ran shampoo through Monica's short, messy brown hair, sending shivers down the petite model's spine. While Monica rode out the tingles with small coos and breaths, Sarah moaned out loud when Monica tried the same on the athletic, busty blonde. Each kiss risked a little bitter taste of soap but it was worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made sure to dry off the breasts and shoulders first for nibbles and pecks before helping to towel off the bellies and other \"lower\" parts of the body neither could reach on themselves. Monica made sure to get a nice, squeezing handful of Sarah's bubble butt when she dried her girlfriend, finally reaping her reward for running the full 10 kilometers. Sarah slowly ran her towel down Monica's slender legs, loving the soft feel of her brown skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need a ride?\" Sarah said once she and Monica were dressed and ready to leave for their respective workplaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're already going to be driving, sure,\" Monica said, trying to pull her shirt down over her belly and only stopping when it seemed like she might rip the fabric before she even makes it over her belly button. \"And then could you...um...\" She bit her wide lip. \"Could you drive me to the doctor's? My ultrasound is later today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed and smiled, kissing Monica right on her forehead. \"Absolutely.\" They gradually made their way into the car before Sabrina waved them down. \"Hey Sabrina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the redhead said without her usual theatrical energy. \"You're going to MegaGym, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a ride? Hop in,\" Sarah said with a smile that faded a bit as Sabrina got closer and she noticed that the wannabe actress's midsection had also expanded. \"Though I don't know how much room there might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room for one more?\" Hilary said quietly, waddling over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Ms. Perkins,\" Sarah said, not commenting on the 50-something's equally expanding stomach. \"What happened to your car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...left it at a friend's house,\" Hilary said with a gulp. Sarah and Monica both spied a hickey on her neck but as Sarah gasped, Monica put her hand on her girlfriend's shoulder to settle her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" Monica whispered. \"Is this how you want to introduce me to your neighbors? As a gossip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Sarah pouted, waiting until both Sabrina and Hilary and their bellies made it inside. \"This is my...my girlfriend Monica.\" Monica blushed and waved to the two passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Hilary nodded, smiling a little. It made her feel a little less odd that there was <i>another</i> pregnant lesbian couple in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica, pleased to know you,\" Sabrina said, her \"acting\" coming back a bit. \"You have such a striking look. Have you ever thought about acting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not really,\" Monica giggled, her freckled nose wrinkling a bit. \"I'm working as a model right now which is...kind of like acting, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Similar,\" Sabrina nodded and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you're really pretty too. There's a pregnant fashion show coming up and we need more women. Would you be interested?\" Monica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina's face turned as red as her hair. \"And who says I'm pregnant?\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no one,\" Monica said, her voice dropping to a rabbit's volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it open to...anyone?\" Hilary said. \"Regardless of...age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's smile returned a bit. \"I could ask but I'm sure you'd fit in, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are,\" Sarah said, stopping at Soft Lace. She and Monica kissed as the model slowly got out of the car. \"Text me when you're ready to go to your appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Monica said, waving to Sabrina and Hilary as she hurried inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the 'pregnancy' remark, Sabrina,\" Sarah said, turning in the direction of the gym. \"She gets nervous and, being pregnant ourselves, I guess we can think other people are in the same boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is...perceptive,\" Sabrina said, placing her palm on top of her belly and feeling a kick. \"I'm going to your friend Nina's class. For expectant mothers.\" Sarah would normally have dropped her jaw and squealed with surprise but...it was so commonplace now. She was just trying to keep track of who was pregnant and who wasn't in her head but that left her a bit tired and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" Hilary said, pointing out a figure in the MegaGym parking lot. Nina was struggling to walk from her car to the gym door, her belly bigger than the rest of her body. They could all make out the impressions of kicks and somersaults, with seven individual bodies inside Nina's immense womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina!\" Sarah said, parking the car quickly and hurrying to help her. \"Are you...okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I may have a bit of an unusual pregnancy,\" Nina panted, sweat dripping off of her golden skin as she tried to walk. Sarah's belly touched hers and Sarah felt a strange prickle of energy. And not good energy. \"The doctors are stumped but they think I'm getting closer to delivery than they expected so...at least there's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some exercise can help get you closer to the big day,\" Sarah said with a bright smile, patting Nina on her stomach, making the humungous instructor wince. \"Oops, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's fine,\" Nina groaned, trying to step up onto the curb as she got inside. Once through the door, Sarah let the others help Nina out as she went to the gym floor for her FemmeFit class. And to her surprise, no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, didn't you get the news?\" Emily said, waddling up to Sarah with her brown, curly hair bouncing around as much as her belly. \"Do you check your gym email at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot the password,\" Sarah said, sticking her tongue out a bit as she gave an apologetic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed and placed her hand on her own bulge, rubbing it slowly. \"Everyone in your FemmeFit class moved over to Nina's pre-natal exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well, good for Nina. She could use the money,\" Sarah sighed, trying to smile and see the positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that easy. Nina can't handle all that on her own. I'm combining the classes,\" Emily said. \"You're both working together in 10 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I don't know anything about pregnant exercise,\" Sarah said. Emily looked down at Sarah's naked belly, still twitching with life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're qualified,\" Emily chuckled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Britney waddled into work more slowly than yesterday. Part of that could be blamed on the fact she was now six months pregnant with sextuplets instead of five months but even factoring that in, Britney had slowed down. Having sex while pregnant twice in less than 24 hours proved to be quite the experience. As a long-time beauty, Britney was no stranger to fucking multiple times in a short window (although she had been going through a dry spell for the past few months or so), but never while carrying 40 pounds on her stomach. She had to lift and twist her hips more than usual to swing her belly around and her hips and butt had gained some weight as well, stressing out her quads and glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all bad, however. Britney had a spring in her step that made her look happier, just not quicker. Britney knew sex was great but she had no idea how much fun pregnant sex could be. All of her weight seemed like a burden coming up but when it slammed back down on her lower regions, it was like fireworks going off. And Kyle was a generous lover, happy to pamper her swollen body and make her feel, for the first time in days, sexy. Even more than the lingerie show did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as slow as Britney thought she was waddling, she spotted someone even slower. Monica was gradually making her way to the back where the model's stage was, wincing and whimpering as she tried to lift one leg at a time, bending her joints slowly. Monica wasn't any bigger than Britney \u2013 in fact, Britney was taller \u2013 but she looked like she had invisible weights tied to her ankles and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing okay?\" Britney asked, standing next to Monica, their bellies eclipsing one another's. Both had to let their stomachs stick out uncovered and Britney lightly stroked the top of hers, letting the sore skin get some pampering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Monica said. \"Just had a tough workout this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" Britney chuckled, removing her sunglasses and smiling wide. Monica grinned back a bit too. Britney was no Sarah but this morning she definitely had a sunny atmosphere about her. \"Okay, big day ahead of us. Let's get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney headed out to the back of Soft Lace where Michelle, Nico, and Gisele were standing and waiting, all in robes. It covered up the lingerie they already had on but did little for their enormous pregnant middles sticking out naked. With quintuplets and sextuplets between them, all of the models looked like over-ripe fruit ready to burst at the slightest movement when they still had three months (or three days) to go. When the other three models spotted Britney, they scoffed under their breath and turned to her, crossing their arms. \"Hey,\" Gisele said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Britney said with a wide smile. \"You all look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're happy,\" Nico remarked, looking Britney up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why shouldn't I be? We've got a great show coming up,\" Britney chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Michelle said, eyeing her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" another voice said. Britney turned around to see Maci waddling in, dressed in her usual bright preppy clothes, though still pulled down tight to hide her twin pregnant belly. \"Britney, is this the right place to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maci? Uh, sure, depends,\" Britney said, reaching out to give her a hug. Maci nearly recoiled, not expecting a hug from Britney out of the Britney/Sarah pair. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be in the show. The lingerie show,\" Maci said, trying to puff out her chest and look confident. Michelle, Nico, and Gisele all gasped quietly and began to gossip as Monica looked at everyone, just as surprised as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Britney said, scratching her head. \"Well, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you're taking new entrants. I've got everything you need. I'm pregnant,\" Maci said, patting her belly, \"and I'm sexy...right?\" She started to feel less confident when she looked at the other models. They were all gorgeous and in terms of belly, far surpassed her. Maci had felt like a cow at home as her old clothes didn't fit and she had to sneak through doorways but looking at them was almost therapeutic if she wasn't looking to enter a show for pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a...a very beautiful young woman,\" Britney sighed. \"But I don't know how your parents would feel about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told them I'm doing it and they aren't going to stop me. Besides, I'm 19. If they won't let me, fuck 'em,\" Maci huffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat line made the other three models start to laugh. \"Let her in, Brit,\" Gisele said. \"She's got a good attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we could use someone who isn't as humungous,\" Michelle said. \"You didn't drink Xpect, did you girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I did,\" Maci said slowly, looking confused. \"What does that have to do with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She drank it and she only looks like that. Some girls have all the luck,\" Nico groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll do great,\" Monica said, slowly waddling up to shake Maci's hand. \"I'm Monica and this is Michelle, Nico, and Gisele. And I guess you already know Britney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're next door neighbors,\" Maci nodded. \"And you must be friends. I saw you come over last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica blushed a lot but it was sometimes hard to see with her dark skin. But boy did it come through this time as her eyes popped open wide and she felt the steam start to come out of her ear. The other models looked at her with their mouths hung open, stuck in a mask of a squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...ummm...\" Monica squeaked, rubbing her belly in bigger and bigger circles. \"I...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies,\" Darren said, cutting her off as he walked in. \"Ah, you must be Maci. Need your fitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I do too,\" Monica said, hurrying off with Darren and Maci as quickly as she could. The other models burst out laughing when she was out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you and Monica?\" Gisele said, wiping a tear from her eye. \"Damn, you are exploiting the shit out of this fashion show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, easy,\" Britney snapped, pointing a finger at Gisele. \"I want to be friendly with you all but me and Darren are still your bosses if you want to work this show. And for your information, I was not at my apartment last night. I spent the night with a-\" Britney fluffed her hair out \"-gentleman caller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh,\" Michelle and Nico both cackled. \"So then why was she at your place?\" Nico further inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and my roommate have gotten into a little something,\" Britney grinned. \"Don't ask her about it, though. I get the sense Monica is really shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Gisele said, eyes still locked on Britney. \"We all have our little secrets, don't we?\" Britney looked at her model with a confused, frustrated expression as the other three returned. \"So, Maci, got any modeling experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I will work hard to get it right,\" Maci nodded fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have some other amateurs in this show so don't worry about that,\" Britney said. \"My friends Sarah and Diana will be here and if it makes anyone feel better, Diana is bigger than any of us so there you go.\" Monica and Maci giggled while the other models remained suspicious of Britney, still believing she purposely gave them Xpect to get them pregnant for the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to be as kind as Britney,\" Darren chuckled, crossing his arms. \"This show is a big deal and while this is Sarah's project, it will still reflect on Soft Lace so I am going to be working with each of you to make this as good as it can be. And I'm sure you all know flirting won't work on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some other women will likely be added into the show so make sure you can work fast and loose,\" Britney said. \"Let's line up and get ready for a quick run-through. Maci, I can show you where you can pick up some lingerie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Britney? Do we still get a break at our usual time?\" Monica asked quietly as everyone split up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to move it around some, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked down at her round belly. \"I have an...ultrasound at noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney smiled and touched Monica's shoulder. \"You go ahead when it's time. Don't worry.\" She leaned forward to whisper in Monica's ear. \"And you can return my sports bra after work.\" Monica felt her skin tingle, seeing the sparkling look in Britney's eyes. She was scary when she was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Britney and Monica talked, Gisele waved Maci over to chat with the other models. \"So, you know Britney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorta. She bought me my pregnancy test so my parents wouldn't find out,\" Maci shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't get too close to her,\" Michelle said. \"She's the reason you're about to be a teen mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Maci said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think it's a coincidence your belly spurted out after you drank Xpect? She gave it to all of us,\" Gisele said, gesturing to everyone's pregnant stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Sarah gave us Xpect,\" Maci said. The models stepped back and looked at each other silently. Just what was going on in Sarah and Britney's apartment. \"But if everyone who drinks Xpect is pregnant...that'd explain Laci...and my mom...but what about my dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo boy,\" Nico said with a chuckle. \"That sounds like a separate problem.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maci reaches into her cleavage and pulled out her phone, unlocking the screen and dialing in a perfect one-handed much practiced routine. The line buzzed, and buzzed, and then buzzed some more. Maci was sure her call was going to go to voicemail (either by her Laci being either unable or unwilling to pick up the phone) when a loud BLARE of garbled death metal came through so loud over the speaker, Maci had to yank the phone away from her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm very busy\" Laci said in a flat tone. She was in fact very busy, downloading her photos from her maternity shoot. The picks were great, but Laci could't help but feel a twang of sadness looking at the photos after everything that had happen with Robin. She though Robin would have been there for her... For the birth, for the late night feedings, for the times when she needed a little bit of... affection in the later stages of her pregnancy when her desires for womanly needs overcame her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci.. It was the Xpect!\" Maci said, trying to keep her voice down, but not trying to remain calm either. \"What was the Xpect?\" Laci asked, rubbing her belly and uploading the photos to her social media account. \"The Xpect got us pregnant!\" Maci said, catching sight of herself in the mirror, her massively expanded belly barely covered by her clothing. <i>She did this to us! But why?</i> Maci said to herself, one hand on her phone, the other absentmindedly exploring the vast expanse of her pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was absent-minded sure, but her heart was in the right place. She would never willingly cause anyone harm, so the idea that Sarah maliciously cause her.. no her whole family, to become pregnant was just ludicrous. What did Sarah have to gain from the Hamiltons waddling around with babies in the belly? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought to her father and all the weight he was gaining over the past few days.. No not wait... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci didn't know if she should laugh or cry about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect is just a drink, made by some company, packed full of hard to pronounce chemicals that people overpay for in an attempt to gain energy. It cannot get anyone pregnant. Do you know how crazy that sounds? An energy drinking getting US pregnant?\" Laci asked, opening a package of fruit snacks and shoving them in her mouth. <br>\r\n\"I thought for someone so in touch with the out there, that you would believe me! Sarah got us pregnant by giving us Xpect! You! Me! Mom!\" Maci gulped so loud she thought it was audible to everyone.. \"Even Dad\" Maci finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud snort of laughter could be heard from the other end of the line. \"Maci, I swear if your ass wasn't pregnant I was sure that you were drunk.\" Laci teased, as she heaved herself out of her desk chair and over to her full length mirror. She turned this way and that, drinking in her pregnant curves from all sides. She even tried to jut out her belly even more than she possibly could. \"Although, I'm not entirely convinced you're not getting shitfaced right now\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci this is serious! I don't know if it's magic or science or just some kind of weird messed up prank, but we pregnant from that drink. Even Dad! I don't know how or why, but all I know is that Sarah GAVE it to us. She did this to us on purpose!\" Maci said, her mistrust of Sarah growing by the second as she explained the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah HAD to know this would have happened. That's why she gave to everyone! Everyone gains weight during pregnancy, and this had to be a ploy to sell memberships for the gym. It had worked on their mother... She bought memberships for the whole family.  <i>Yes. That's why! Everyone would have baby weight to lose! And where else to do it but MegaGym!</i> Maci was convinced that Sarah did this on purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci was wrong, but at least she was thinking about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can guarantee that there is no way an energy drink gets a woman pregnant. And Dad? He's just getting fat because he's gross. As for how we got pregnant, I tapped into the lay lines around here for some serious magic casting. I guess I must have been a little too good at that fertility spell I casted.\" Laci said, taking more pictures of her pregnant self, holding up a middle finger as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with the dark arts Harry Potter bullshit Laci! This isn't some game! I think Sarah is willing getting people pregnant through the Xpect stuff to generate business for her gym!\" Maci retorted. Every day it was \"Dark spirits this, untold magics that, Voldemort hit me with a whiffle ball bat\" that Maci just COULD NOT EVEN right now. She loved her sister for believing in something, but this was not the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit? BULLSHIT?\" Laci was getting more annoyed than offended or pissed. \"Let me show you how bullshit this really is!\" Laci said, hanging up her self and throwing in on the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCALL ENDED. \"Shit.\" Maci said looking at the screen. \"Laci, please don't be Laci and do anything rash\" Maci said, hoping that here wish would come true. She tried to redial her sister but was greeted by the voice mail message  of \"Laci doesn't want to talk right now. Piss off\". Maci sighed, and decided to call somebody. Anybody. Somebody needed to know the horrible truth that Maci had decided was reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet the news would LOVE to hear about this..\" Maci said to herself, dialing the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Meanwhile - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah did it! It got Dad pregnant. I'm Maci HUR\" Laci said to herself in a mocking voice as she creeped back out into the kitchen. She reached into one of the cabinets and pulled out a can of Xpect. \"I'm going to show her that she's full of shit. It's just a drink Maci\" Laci said popping the top of the can. She heard a noise coming from the guest room and realized that her father was still up. Sneaking over to the guest room, she noticed that the door was slightly ajar, and let her curiosity get the best of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father was standing there, shirtless, taking pictures of himself in the mirror. He almost looked like he was taking stylized maternity photos with the way he was positioning the shots and the way he was standing, His belly was massive and a dark line was starting to form down the center. It was impossibly round, almost watermelon shaped and was covered in stretch marks. Laci though he almost looked like a pregnant gorilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnant. That word echoed in her mind. It brought her back to what she was doing. By the outside table was her father travel mug with the words \"World's OKest Dad\" written on it (A gag gift from Laci and Maci on his birthday one year). Next to it was a opened empty beverage package called \"From to Maternity Milkshake: An Instant Powered Drink for Pregnant Women! Prompts healthy weight gain, baby growth, and more! Just add water.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas her father drinking this? She unscrewed the top and got a whiff of some kind of strawberry scented watery beverage in the cup. <i>Twice a day</i> was written on a note next to the beverage in her father's handwriting. Suddenly, Laci got a wonderful, awful, terrible idea. She knew a perfect way to show how full of shit her sister really was. Making sure her father couldn't see her, she poured half of the can of Xpect into the cup and stirred it around. \"This will show you Maci. God I can't wait to see the look on your face when I show you how wrong you were\". She fastened the top back on, knocked on the door, and moved as fast as she could waddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father let out an audible gasp, but when going to investigate saw nothing that would indicate that his dark secret had been revealed. He picked up his drink cup and took a massive sip, nearly gagging as he downed nearly the whole shake at once. \"God, this shit's almost as bad as that Xpect stuff. I can't believe I'm going to have to drink this shit...\" He said looking down at his life filled orb. \"I can't believe a lot of thing lately. How the hell did this happen to me?\" He said, rubbing his belly. \"God this shit's going to make me nauseous.\" He said, finishing the drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, she pondered the half-full can on Xpect. \"No, I need to show you just how wrong you are. It's not like shit even works. What's it going to do? Make me more pregnant?\" Laci chuckled to herself, downing the other half of the Xpect. </span></div></div>",

That order proved a lot easier for her to pull off than much of her class. Sarah and her side of the gym were all squatting, their pregnant bellies forcing their legs even farther apart depending on how many they were carrying (almost everyone seemed to be six months along so they were equal in that respect). Standing back up straight took some time and Sarah was even giving herself a workout, which didn't usually come from her classes. But her many years as a fitness freak meant she had the core and lower body to lift her packed womb and bubble butt. Her class would take a little more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy, an aging woman who started FemmeFit to take back control of her life without expecting to become expecting, whimpered loudly. \"Sarah, it's so...it's so heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Peg, it's just like lifting weights,\" Sarah huffed in her same energetic tone. But she could see Peggy's complaint. The woman had a small frame before and her pregnancy was making a lot of changes in her. Not only did she had the obvious prominent belly but her breasts and butt had exploded with hormones, even more rapidly than was the case with Sarah and her voluptuous friends. Sarah could see the similar toll on the other women and once they were all up right, Sarah took a break. \"Everyone, give yourself a round of applause. You're doing great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they clapped and felt their spirits lifted a bit, Sarah looked over at the other half of the class. It was made up of more \"traditionally pregnant\" women that Nina had led before Xpect came into everyone's lives. Nina was not giving them as rugged a workout as Sarah but that was partially because she could barely move. Somehow, she was going through a very different set of transformations than Sarah and everyone else she knew who drank Xpect. With each passing day, Nina seemed to grow a new, full-term baby in her belly and she now looked like her body was constantly wrestling to decide whether she would topple over first or explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nina was still committed to putting on a class and it was a marvel to behold. The colossal, olive-toned mound of a belly wiggled and shook and moved back and forth, glistening with sweat under MegaGym's bright fluorescents. Every quick move started a few flurry of kicks and stretches from the fetuses inside her and Sarah could see the globe of a belly change shape, much to Nina's chagrin, but she kept going. Sarah sighed and smiled, glad to have a partner here like Nina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sarah?\" Megan, a young expectant wife in the class, said, wiping her face dry. \"Should we keep-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's keep moving,\" Sarah said, switching over to a new song and starting to hop back and forth. \"Let's do some side shuffles, ten at a time. And one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the class ended, Sarah was cleaning herself up, not used to generating that much sweat during a workout. But she could feel the beginnings of a promising burn in her quads and glutes. Maybe pregnancy could be marketed as a new exercise fad...Sarah started to weigh the pros and cons but her mind drifted off when she saw a commercial for allergy medicine on a faraway TV and giggled at the cartoon bee selling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help,\" Nina said, waddling over and sitting next to Sarah with a grunt, her hands immediately going to her quivering belly for a much-needed rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It was fun and besides, you would have stolen away my students otherwise,\" Sarah said with a laugh, elbowing Nina playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Everyone's got a baby on the way now. I started before it was cool,\" Nina chuckled, wincing as she leaned back. \"Oof, a cramp and a kick at the same time. Bad timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's big smile started to shrink down as she saw the frustration in Nina's face. \"How is everything...going with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a rollercoaster, I dunno,\" Nina sighed, sticking with her leaned back position which pushed her belly farther out. \"I've gotten used to a new boy or girl popping up every day and I can only wait on the doctors to learn something new. And my husband and I are both happy to have more kids; we just thought there would be some space in between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're both taking it well,\" Sarah gulped, not sure whether to tell Nina it was her Xpect that caused all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, paying for college is going to be a hill to climb but we'll figure something out,\" Nina said, leaning over to Sarah to whisper. \"And between you and me...the sex has been incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed, immediately picturing Nina naked with a bulldozer of a belly in the throngs of passion. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina nodded. \"The hormones, the kinkiness, and the big moment is so much stronger. Have you had a chance to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled, patting her lower stomach. \"I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you,\" Nina smiled. \"You're a great gal and it's a bad sign when someone like you is single.\" She put both hands onto the back of the bench and tried to push herself off, gritting her teeth and grunting until she stopped. \"Guess I'm going to sit here for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...have a good day!\" Sarah said, rolling herself forward and waddling back up to the office to try and get something to eat and drink. On the way through the usual exercise space, she spotted Sabrina bouncing her enormous butt on an exercise ball while holding two weights. \"Hi Sabrina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Sarah,\" Sabrina said, putting her equipment down and gliding over as best she could with a belly full of amniotic fluid. \"Good to see you again. Things went well with your class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they moved me to a pregnancy class,\" Sarah said, patting her belly. \"Turns out it's a good fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah,\" Sabrina said, her face twitching a bit at the mention of pregnancy. \"And would there be...any openings in your class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure!\" Sarah said with a big grin until she saw Sabrina's eyes start to well up. \"Um, is there something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, it's ahw-ful!\" Sabrina wailed, falling into Sarah's arms. \"I'm expecting! I'm with child! How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay,\" Sarah said, shushing Sabrina and rubbing her back as their bellies pressed together. \"It's not the end of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the end of my career! Actresses turn lousy after they become mothers,\" Sabrina sobbed. \"All the best actresses: no babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...know if that's true,\" Sarah said, her knowledge of which actresses had kids and which ones didn't very limited. \"And you'll do fine. It'll add character to your performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina pulled back and sniffled. \"Character?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, build on what you're going through. A woman with a promising future who mysteriously became pregnant. Use that in your performances,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...that's true,\" Sabrina said, nodding until she snapped her eyes back to Sarah. \"Wait, how did you know it was mysterious?\" Sarah froze and gulped. \"Everyone in our apartment seems to have a 'mysterious' pregnancy, even that horrible lesbian goth girl.\" Sabrina stepped forward, pushing Sarah back with her belly. \"Sarah, is there something you know you aren't telling us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sorry, need to go pick up some...electrolytes,\" Sarah said, pacing away from Sabrina and jogging away. \"We'll talk later! Good luck with your...exercise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah hurried away, she got a text from Monica &lt;can you take me to my ultrasound appt?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank God,\" Sarah said to herself as she replied to Monica. As Sarah made her way to the office to grab her keys and bag, a belly pushed out of a doorway to stop her. And connected to it was one of the few things about the gym that didn't make Sarah just explode into a ray of sunshine. \"Excuse me, Rebecca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, am I in your way?\" Rebecca said with mock apology, waddling forward and rubbing her bare belly. \"Sorry, I'm just so proud of the babies my <b>boyfriend</b> and I made together.\" Rebecca had grown quite a bit in the last few days, just like everyone else, but compared to Sarah she was still slim and trim. \"Our two beautiful twins are coming right along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for you,\" Sarah said, fishing for her keys in her bag. She didn't want to tell Rebecca about her own relationship \u2013 she'd drop that bombshell later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I can still move so well even with the children on the way,\" Rebecca said, kicking one leg all the way up to 180 degrees. \"I might even start teaching classes for pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think those are set,\" Sarah said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I heard a lot of complaints that you went a bit hard on the women today. Maybe I'll look into that and see if someone else can't do it better,\" Rebecca smiled back. \"Someone with a little more dexterity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, go talk to all the women in my class,\" Sarah said, taking her keys and waddling out. \"And while you're at it, maybe they can give you some parenting advice. Your children deserve a good role model, after all.\" Sarah left as Rebecca bit her lip, fuming silently in the office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah had to lay down a few towels in the seat of her car to avoid getting sweat over everything. With her large pregnant belly, she was uncomfortable enough driving as it was. Getting everything wet and sticky would only make that worse. As Sarah struggled with her seatbelt, she felt a strong kick jerk her forward. She stopped and gasped, touching the top of her stomach. There had been a few shifts and ripples from inside her but this was a full-blown kick. Sarah rubbed slowly, trying to pick up on more of the movement. Then, on the opposite pole of her globular stomach, another hard push made Sarah yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Sarah mused, reaching between her thighs to cup the underside of her belly where another of her sextuplets was getting restless. \"You're all kinda strong. Must run in the family.\" She figured they had to be strong to stretch out her belly. It felt so firm and rigid. And those kicks really stretched out her skin and pinched. \"Just try not to kick too much while I'm driving. I'd hate to have to explain this to a traffic cop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at Soft Lace, Monica sat on the side as she watched Maci nervously paced back and forth near the runway. With a small sigh, the freckled model heaved herself up, waited a few seconds to regain balance, and then waddled over to the much smaller woman. \"Hi,\" Monica said with a smile, stroking her still-uncovered brown belly. \"Don't be worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" Maci scoffed, not even looking at Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job on the catwalk,\" Monica smiled. \"But I think after a little bit, your nerves got to you. I used to be the same way...well, I still am but I have a few techniques to not be so nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, this isn't what I'm nervous about,\" Maci said, glancing at Monica. She just found out she, her sister, her mother, and ridiculously her father were all pregnant thanks to an energy drink of all things. And Laci, the one who believes in demons and black magic (or as Laci insisted on calling it, black magicks), though Maci was being crazy. \"I'm just going through a hard time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica tightened her smile a bit, weirdly seeing some of herself in Maci, though she never had that natural preppy charisma Maci exuded. \"Still, there are ways to get it all out of your head on the walkway. Look.\" Monica walked Maci onto the runway and pointed forward. \"You know how the light would be shining right there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Maci said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just focus on the space right above the light. Barely above it, even. And then, in your head, count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count to what?\" Maci asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count until you finish. But only count prime numbers,\" Monica chuckled. \"It helps keep your mind clear and then you let your body do the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lately my body has a mind of its own,\" Maci said, looking down at her belly. With twins, she looked just about fully due for a single pregnancy but Monica looks comparatively ready to burst, her belly button closer to Maci than to her own actual stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Monica said with another laugh. \"But you'll do great. We didn't think we could do the first lingerie run with our tummies but it went okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci looked down, a scowl developing, before looking back at Monica. \"How can you work for her after what she did to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney. She gave us Xpect. She wanted us to be pregnant,\" Maci grumbled before she felt her pocket vibrate. It was her mother. \"Hang on, I...I gotta take this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maci waddled away, Monica felt something hard press against her lower back and two sweaty arms wrap around her, just below her breasts. \"Guess who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The belly gives it away,\" Monica smiled, turning in Sarah's arms to meet her girlfriend and give her a quick peck on the lips. \"Let me get dressed quick, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, okay,\" Sarah said in a mock-sad voice, looking over the half-naked model. As Sarah chuckled, Nico and Michelle flanked her on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two really are going out, huh?\" Michelle said, her voice low and joyless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! It's a happy accident,\" Sarah giggled, brushing some of her bright hair behind her ears like a nervous girl with a schoolyard crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you like the belly?\" Nico asked, glancing over at Michelle as they exchanged a silent acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I do,\" Sarah said, really blushing now as she bit her bottom lip. \"It looks sorta sexy, right? I mean, that's why this whole pregnant lingerie show is happening anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly why,\" Michelle said, tightening her fist. \"Well, you two have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Sarah said, turning and giving the two models a big hug. \"And any friends of Britney are friends of mine!\" When Monica came back out with a jacket and pants on, Sarah hurried after her, the two holding onto one another as they left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisele walked up behind Nico and Michelle, both still staring in Sarah's direction. \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were both in on it. Sarah and Britney,\" Nico said. \"Sarah got Xpect because she has a pregnancy fetish and Britney thought she could spin it into the lingerie show for money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew her roommate had to be in on it. No one is that air-headed,\" Gisele said. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hugged us,\" Michelle said with a shrug. \"I dunno, seemed suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Gisele nodded. \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in the parking lot, Sarah squeezed into the car as she felt another kick jerk her forward. \"Hey, careful! You might make me honk the horn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're kicking?\" Monica asked, leaning near Sarah. \"Can I feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked back at her and smiled, rolling up her sweatsuit to reveal yards of soft, smooth belly. \"Any time you want.\" Monica placed her hand on Sarah's belly and gently traced, opening up her palm to feel kicks, punches, and stretches. \"How about you? Any big movements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes. It started today,\" Monica smiled, looking down as she got bashful again. \"W-we'd better go. I'd hate to miss my appointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanner?\" the nurse Jackie called out. Monica sighed and tried to get out of her chair, her belly nearly too wide for her to get out. Sarah took her arm and helped her stand, smiling at Monica as she helped her friend to the examination room. \"Oh, you again,\" Jackie said when she saw Sarah. \"Here for an appointment too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I'm set,\" Sarah said, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised. Lots of people are coming back when they saw themselves get bigger,\" Jackie shrugged. \"Something's going around we're not quite sure about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather just focus on my friend for now,\" Sarah said, reaching around Monica's hip to touch her belly. Monica smiled and leaned against Sarah, their scalps rubbing a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me. It's been even more of a zoo here,\" Jackie said, guiding them into a room and helping Monica up onto the examination chair. \"My, you're one of the bigger ones too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Birds of a feather flock together,\" said a lilting voice. They all turned to see Dr. Pascat gracefully stroll into the room. Monica seemed a little mesmerized by the doctor but Sarah flinched, still confused by her similarity to the woman the Xpect commercial. \"Jackie, I can take this one. They need another nurse in a room down the hall. A gentleman is...not taking the discovery of twins inside him well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Jackie sighed, heading out the door. \"I swear, there's only two kinds of guys who seem to be turning up pregnant: the ones who act like it's the end of the world and the ones who secretly always wanted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's look and see what you've got going on here,\" Dr. Pascat smiled, gelling up Monica's bare belly. \"And please don't mind me saying you have incredible pregnant skin, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you,\" Monica blushed, reaching over to take Sarah's hand and squeeze it. Dr. Pascat placed the wand onto Monica's belly and pressed it in ever so firmly, making Monica gasp and tense up. Sarah placed her other hand on top of Monica's and brushed her with loving care, sending the hairs on the back of Monica's neck on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what perfectly healthy fetuses,\" Dr. Pascat cooed, looking into Monica's hazel eyes with her own piercing blue ones. \"All six of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-six babies,\" Monica said, almost wheezing with shock. She and Sarah, pregnant with six kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everything looks just wonderful,\" the doctor said, taking a few more notes before handing Monica something to clean off her belly. \"I hope you two weren't...worried about being pregnant unexpectedly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Monica looked at each other. \"We had our concerns,\" Sarah smiled, placing one hand on Monica's shoulder. \"But the important thing is we're having healthy babies, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Dr. Pascat smiled. \"Now then, if you could both get dressed and sit in our waiting space, I can give you a full report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting room again?\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor laughed with a chime-like sound. \"Oh no, it's a separate waiting room. Down the hall on your right,\" she said, her smile growing slightly. Sarah helped Monica back up and followed the doctor's instructions. But once they turned into the waiting area, both stopped dead in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a coincidence,\" Kate said, cackling as she looked at both of them. And next to Kate sat a heavily pregnant and tattooed Robin. \"Why don't we all sit down and catch up. It's been too long.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maci struggled with her new maternal weight as she waddled away from the stage to take the phone call. She always been curvy and round in the best places, with breasts bigger than the palm of her hand and a respectably plump rear. Now, her breasts were about as big as her belly was a few days ago and her ass could act as a quick table if someone needed a free hand around her. Both put a strain on her, from the soreness in her back and shoulders from her chest to the slow speed of her wide thighs as they wrestled with the weight of her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, there was her belly. Being roughly six months pregnant with twins was its own obstacle too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Maci said, dropping her voice so the other models didn't hear her conversation. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Maci,\" her mom, Trisha, replied with a sigh. \"Why are you so quiet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci paced and squirmed in place, feeling her cheeks burn. She really wanted Gisele, Nico, and Michelle to respect her and she worried how they'd react if they caught her taking time out of practice to talk to her <i>mommy</i>. Those three had a mean streak that was unrivaled even back in her high school. Not middle school, though. Middle school girls were true killers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Maci mumbled. \"What did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha sighed again, patting her belly on the other end of the call. At 47, she had hoped she was past hearing her daughters talk back to her and they'd be going on with their own lives soon. Now, with the family's pregnancies, she not only worried Laci and Maci would stay at home longer and not emotionally mature at a regular pace thanks to the stress of early parenthood but Trisha would end up with two more foul-mouthed children to take care of. At least by the time she hit her 60s, she hoped she'd finally be past her baby-making days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to let you know we're having a nice dinner tonight with the neighbors,\" Trisha said. \"Tami and Andrew Smith. You know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know them but we barely ever talk,\" Maci said, rolling her eyes a bit. As newlyweds, they were annoying enough. Andrew seemed as stiff as a board and Tami always had a snarky side Maci didn't like. \"Why now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With so many changes going on, it would be good to start connecting with the people around us,\" Trisha said, palm stretching out to touch more of her firm belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we're moving into our house soon, right? They won't be our neighbors for much longer,\" Maci said. Both Hamiltons bit their lip, deciding how much to say. Maci knew her father, the one getting them into the new house, had a...surprise on the way and would likely be distracted. And Trisha had deep suspicions that her husband and Andrew were having an affair and wasn't sure about the future of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's good to talk with them,\" Trisha said, forcing a smile even though Maci couldn't see her. \"H-hey, have you noticed anything strange with your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci froze, wondering if her mom picked up on the weird male pregnancy. \"Uh...like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just anything. Maybe he leaves the house at odd times,\" Trisha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but...maybe we should talk more in person,\" Maci said. She tried to tell Laci about Xpect and their pregnancies over the phone and that didn't go too well. Face-to-face was the only option if she was going to be taken seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I-*gasp*\" Trisha said, jumping up in her seat a bit. \"Oh Maci, I just felt a kick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big deal, you've been pregnant before, right?\" Maci said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha groaned. \"Maci, being pregnant at the same time as you and your sister has been a very...difficult experience sometimes and I am trying to find a positive, getting us to connect over this but if you are going to be...well, like you always are, then that's all. See you at dinner.\" Trisha slammed her phone down and pinched the bridge of her nose before turning her attention back to her belly and tracing the kicks. As she rubbed, Thomas walked into the lab, blushing when he saw Trisha roll up her shirt to touch her bare belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-didn't mean to disturb you,\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry,\" Trisha sighed, putting her outfit and lab coat back on to turn to him. \"What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted the inventory from the lab before the break-in so you could continue your studies,\" Thomas said, handing her a folder. \"Not much went missing, I have to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's lucky. I hate to think of someone desperate for painkillers or other drugs broke in to steal but at least no one got hurt,\" Trisha said, flipping through the files. \"Why does a sports drink keep coming up? Is it appropriate for an employee to complain about their lunch being stolen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no, that was part of an experiment. Actually, the woman who last held your position studied it,\" Thomas said, blushing a little more at the thought of Diana catching him in the conversation. She was already livid about being pushed out of her lab job but if she knew he was helping someone else with her research? He might find out just how heavy that belly of hers really is. \"It was called Xtreme or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect,\" Trisha said, reading it off the page slowly. \"Say...that researcher wouldn't still be here, would she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas' heart was like a hummingbird's. \"Uh...yeah, she's still here at Trionic. You want to meet?\" Trisha nodded and smiled. \"Okay...sure. I think you'll hit it off, actually.\" He took one last look at Trisha's belly. \"You both have a lot in common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Soft Lace, Maci was waddling back to the rest of her partners, all glaring at Britney as she was demonstrating a catwalk posture. \"I know I'm a little bigger but it's the same basic principle,\" Britney said with a chuckle, jutting her stomach out as she popped her hip. \"See, it not only makes your butt more prominent but it makes your belly bigger too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we want this,\" Gisele said, prodding her large brown stomach, \"to be even bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney looked between the models, a little stunned. \"Well, it <u>is</u> a maternity lingerie show. Everyone knows the bellies are going to be there so why not show them off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triumvirate of models looked at one another, silently conversing before Maci decided to speak up. \"Um, Britney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Maci?\" Britney said, smiling a little at the young woman's participation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know Xpect would make us pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Britney's smile left as quickly as it appeared. She looked like she'd just watched someone smash her car right in front of her. Before she answered, Britney looked at Gisele, Nico, and Michelle, all three pregnant beauties now looking very intently at Britney. She stepped forward and dropped her voice. \"You all know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Michelle said, not looking pleased at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney ran one hand through her blond locks and groaned. \"No, I did not know. You think I'd have taken it if I did? I don't know the first thing about raising a baby, let alone six.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Six</i>? Maci thought, her big blue eyes popping a bit. <i>Shit, that explains her size I guess</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've thought about that,\" Nico purred, slowly stroking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney looked even more surprised. \"Wait, you think I actually <b>wanted</b> everyone to get pregnant? Before a big fashion show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worked out pretty well so far,\" Gisele mused, turning around and looking at the set design being put together for the maternity lingerie show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you all believe this?\" Britney repeated, glaring at her models. The main three all looked pleased with unveiling the truth but Maci was looking down at her swollen stomach. \"Okay...let's call it a day. Come back tomorrow with some fresh heads.\" She grabbed her clothes and stormed to the back while the models cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Michelle said. They sighed and stared at their bellies, feeling the kicks stretch out their tight wombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the tricky part,\" Gisele admitted. \"I don't know if there's any legal action we can take but for now, let's just plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we still doing the fashion show?\" Nico said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them thought about it. \"I'm not passing up a committed pay day but after that, I'm cutting it with Soft Lace,\" Gisele said. \"Plus I've got my acting career to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Maci was heading to the dressing room already, trembling a bit as she thought about the hurt look in Britney's eyes. As she started to gather her clothes, she looked at herself in the mirror and turned sideways, tracing one hand slowly down her pregnant silhouette, pushing it around her breasts to accentuate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't look so bad like this,\" Maci murmured, turning the other way. \"I could get what Laci sees in it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David groaned as he got off the elevator, one hand pressed firmly into the small of his back, the other cradling the vast expanse of his pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waddled his way to his desk, he felt the stares of a hundred eyes looking at him and heard the hushed tones of a dozen whispers. <br>\r\nHe felt angry, embarrassed, scared, nervous and most importantly.. bigger. He felt like he could feel himself getting bigger by the second, like he was getting even MORE pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pregnant</i> he thought that word in his head. How the hell did this happen to David Hamilton? At 50, he was on the fast track for the Senior Management of Sales &amp; Advertising, and was going to shake up the office and the industry with some lofty new ideas and goals. It was what he was made for, well that, and the occasional indulgence in the vast world of women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a ladies man, the cock of the walk, and he knew it. His charming personality, silver tongue and decent looks made him a real lady killer. Yes, he loved Trish, but he was never one to really settle down, and a waitress here, a secretary there didn't hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo perhaps when he collapsed himself into his chair, with the vast expanse of his pregnancy spilling into his lap, he though about Karma. <br>\r\nKarma can turn right around and bite you they say, and Karma looked like it took a dinosaur sized bite out of David. The chickens of womanizing and shady deals have came home to roost inside the great furnace that was David Hamilton's pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhining from a sharp kick to his bladder, David ran a hand over the spot where the activity of the unborn was clearly visible under the skin-tight white dress shirt that barely covered his belly. He grabbed a box of office paper and put his feet up, trying to rest his swollen ankles. He allowed himself to close his eye for a moment, all while he swore he felt himself getting larger by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock, Knock!\" came an older female voice into his office. David snapped to attention, and tried to cover his obvious pregnancy. \"Oh, Karley, good morning.\" David said, making himself look real busy with fake work. \"What can I do for you?\" His eyes not looking up for the day-old notes on his desk. \"We need to talk\" Karley said, hiding herself in the door frame of his office. \"About what?\" David asked, about to dread the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" Karley said, waddling herself in, pregnant belly leading the way first. At 50, Karley was one of the senior executives at the company, a no nonsense business woman who would only look down on the people below her to see what she stepped on climbing the ladder to success. Thrice married and divorced   five times (no one ever asked how you can be divorced without being married), Karley was as cold as she was successful, and she was very very successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a black and white stripped dress that looked like it cost double of what David earned in a good year, with a diamond brooch necklace and a diamond hair pin that ran through her greying strawberry blonde hair. A combination of years of expensive breast enhancement surgery and her surprise pregnancy kept her \"Assests\" as she called them in near peak perfect condition. She looked like a gracefully aging supermodel, which was to her design as men, thinking only with the head that was not attached to their shoulders, would underestimate her in the business world. Her mind was the gun and her body the ammunition and she was a skilled marksman at using both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, as she stood in David's office, pushing her pregnant belly out for David to drink in, time seemed to stand still for both of them. Karley was a business woman that had no time for things such as children, but now she looked ready to pop, and while she wasn't happy with her current situation, she was going to try her best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is that?\" David asked pointing at the huge pregnant belly attached to Karley. \"That.. would be the.. results of our.. merger.. so to speak\" She said, rubbing her pregnant belly. \"You mean?\" David asked, dumbfounded. \"They are yours David\" She said cold and sternly. \"They?\" David gulped, already knowing the answer to his next question \"You mean, as in plural?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twins David\" Karley responded. <i>It runs in the genes</i> was the only thing that David could think of at the current moment. \"Boys. Carl and Jacob\" Karley said, rubbing a sore spot in her back. \"You.. already named them?\" David asked. \"Of course, you typically name children you plan to raise\" Karley asked <br>\r\nDavid felt like screaming, everywhere he went pregnancy seemed to follow him. Was he cursed? He certainly felt cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look David, I didn't come in here to ask for you to leave your wife, or for money. I make three times more than you do. Our children will want for nothing. I just wanted to let you know that I fully expect you to be in your sons lives when I deem in necessary. You shall see them when I think it's appropriate, and will have no other outside communication. I've done everything else on my own my whole life, and I don't need you or anyone else telling me how to raise these children. I may not like children or ever had any desire to have any, but I feel a certain general curiosity as to the prospect of being a mother. How hard can children be I ask myself? Do I not negotiate multi-million dollar deals before breakfast?\" Karley said, putting all her cards on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why are you here? Why tell me all this if you don't want me to be apart of this?\" David asked. <br>\r\n\"Three things\" Karley asked holding up three fingers \"One, I want you to know that your children with me existed. I don't want them to not know their own father. Two, I plan on telling your wife, as soon as possible. I've seen you walk about the office, charming your way into the pants of any young woman who will listen. Such indiscretions will not fly with me. I understand that we got into this mess together, and perhaps that energy drink / tonic cocktail I had last week clouded my judgement and landed me in bed with you, but I will not be the \"other\" woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god no, she's going to tell Trisha</i> David thought to himself. \"What was three?\" David asked, his mouth operating faster than his brain. \"Mr. Hicks wanted to see you\" Karley said, cradling her belly with both hands. Mr. Hicks? The Head of the Company? To see him? Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does Mr. Hicks want to see me?\" David asked. \"I don't know. Nobody has seen him since the mixer last week. Just shut himself in his office. He's the first one in and the last one out. Just told me to come find you after he saw you on the office security cameras this morning\" Karley removed her hands from her belly, and looked out to the zone of cubicles and desks on the main floor. \"I'll be bye tonight to tell your wife about these two\" Karley said patting her belly. <br>\r\n\"I look forward to it\" David said sarcastically. \"Oh, and congratulations\" Karley said, in a surprisingly pleasant tone. \"I'm sorry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great. I've heard rumors about some men around town, didn't think it would happen here. If there's anything you need, just let me know, pregnant woman to pregnant.. person\" Karley said, nodding towards David's belly before leaving back out to her own office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just perfect</i> David though to himself, he hands absentmindedly resting on his belly. He rested for a few moments, before heaving himself out of his chair and waddling to Mr. Hicks office. Along his slow methodical journey he felt everyone staring at him again. News travels fast in a office, and news like this would certainly be hard to miss. He got mostly confused stares, but some of the stares looked disgusted, like he was some kind of freak. Yet, he caught the smile of another young woman in the office, who let out a small \"aww\" as David waddled by, almost infatuated by the pregnant man of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in front of Mr. Hicks' door, and knocked. \"Whose is it?\" The gruff voice behind the door said. \"It's uh me sir. David Hamilton. You asked to see me?\" David said timidly. David heard the stories, and the only time you meet Alexander Hicks face-to-face in his office was when your ass got fired. Nobody saw the boss like this and lived with their job intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, close the door quickly\" Mr HIcks said, and David did what he was told. He saw Mr. Hicks with his back turned to the door, staring out the windows, hands behind his back. HIs office was elegant yet simple, like something you would see out of a Hollywood movie about the \"big shot\" executive. Awards, globes, degrees, art, plants, were tastefully splotched around the office. This office looked like more than million bucks, preciously 25.25 million a year with bonus options per quarterly period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this about sir?\" David said, sitting in a chair, desperately trying to cover his pregnance. He didn't want the boss to see him like this, after all that's what this had to be about right? \"Family. I've never been much of a family man Hamilton. Been too busy building a multimillion dollar empire. Or sure there were wives, and mistresses, and the wives that were a decade younger than my current mistress, but never a family you know?\" David was confused. \"I look at the future, and wonder, what am I going with this company? What legacy am I leaving?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" David asked. \"You're a family man Hamilton, in more ways than one, I see\" referring to David's \"passengers\". \"I'm coming over to your place tonight for dinner Hamilton. I want to met your family. See what makes you tick\" Hicks said. \"Sir tonight? Uh wah?\" David was confused. \"I see you as a man of the future, someone who could help me leave something behind for my children\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was getting that raise! This was fantastic, new job, more money.. Wait.. Children? \"Sir, you don't have any children..\"<br>\r\nMr Hicks finally turned around to reveal his massive pregnant belly, straining to burst out of his expensive suit. \"Three boys, they tell me. Now let's talk about dinner tonight. I think we have things in common.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why don't we all sit down and catch up? It's been too long,\" Kate chuckled as she eyed Sarah and Monica. Monica's dark, freckled face was starting to turn pale while Sarah's peach-toned skin was turning bright red. She saw that Kate was back in town through social media and Britney and Diana mentioned she was prowling around the lingerie show but she had yet to actually see in Kate again in person. It had been years since Kate absolutely dashed Sarah's heart to pieces and now, at the OB/GYN office while she was getting an ultrasound, she saw Kate sitting next to a heavily pregnant woman of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's jaw was hurting with how tightly she was clenching her jaw but as she opened it to speak, another little voice spoke up. \"Kate?\" Sarah turned to see her model girlfriend's eyes get wide as the name escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me,\" Kate laughed again. \"Come on, take a load off. You both must get exhausted carrying all that around.\" She turned to Robin and placed one hand on her exposed, tattooed belly and gave it a hard jiggle. \"I know you do.\" Robin grunted and nodded, quickly putting both hands on the sides of her wide stomach to stroke it and settle the movement inside. Compared to Sarah and Monica, Robin was a few inches smaller in diameter but looked just as uncomfortable, if not more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many are you two carrying?\" Robin asked gruffly as they both reluctantly sat down as far from Kate as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six,\" Sarah said, turning to lock eyes with Kate. That only lasted a few seconds as the gleeful glimmer in Kate's violet eyes made Sarah have to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I feel lucky,\" Robin said, lifting her hips to resettle her belly, holding onto it like a loose parcel as its weight rolled around her swollen body. \"Only four but they said they look like they're due any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six little Sarahs and six little Monicas,\" Kate cooed, pressing her hands together. \"What an interesting world the children of the future are going to grow up in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know her name?\" Sarah and Monica asked in unison, looking at each other confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kate was truly laughing out loud, rubbing her palms. \"You two didn't know? I mean, I almost didn't believe the two of you found each other but I thought Britney or Diana might have clued you in.\" She slinked over, bending down to give them both a look at the cleavage they used to fondle in bed. \"We used to date. Both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was practically boiling with emotion now. Anger, sadness, regret, lust, and another dose of anger for good measure. But she couldn't get all the thoughts out of her head, not used to feeling so much negativity. Instead, she felt her cheeks burn as tears welled up in the corner of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, smells like you still work out way too much. That just makes your hair dry out and shrinks your breasts, you know,\" Kate said, turning to Monica and grinning. \"But how are the two of you together? How does it work with all that baby fat? Monica, I know you were <i>very</i> inexperienced when we went out but even you must find it strange.\" Kate reached out and rubbed the back of her finger by Monica's navel. \"If only those bullies from back home could see you now, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch her,\" Sarah said, a few words finally breaking through her mental barricade. Her belly pushed Kate back a few steps and she was unconsciously flexing her arms and shoulders, showing just how burly she could be when she wanted. \"If you treated her like you treated me, so help me you...I don't want to use the b-word but...you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy,\" Kate said, holding up her arms as Robin came to her aid, staring down Sarah. While Robin didn't have Sarah's overall athleticism, she was tall and buff enough to square off. \"We're all just moms-to-be here, come to take care of our little bundles of joy. No reason to get physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom-to-be?\" Monica said, beginning to tremble. \"Y-you're actually going to raise c-children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gulped and turned to Kate, their eyes silently communicating a very personal subject. \"We're having a conversation,\" Kate replied with an untroubled smile, contrasted with Robin's lifting eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica?\" Dr. Pascat's soft voice said. The four women stepped away as the doctor strode in and handed Monica a clipboard. \"Everything checks out fine. You can take that form to fill out pre-natal prescriptions.\" She looked between their faces, from Robin's worry to Sarah's fury to Monica's shock to Kate's pleased smile. \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine, Jeannie,\" Kate said, putting one arm around Robin's hips. \"Just catching up with old friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. Then I'll leave you both to it,\" the doctor nodded, flashing Kate a serpent-like smile and glance before leaving for the rest of the office. When Monica got her form, she and Sarah left the room as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye now,\" Kate called out. \"And good luck at the fashion show! I'll be there!\" She belted out another laugh as they left the room and turned to Robin, holding onto the pregnant punk tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mean it? That you wanted to be a mother?\" Robin asked. \"I'm not the domestic type but...four babies...I could use some help-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh, that's so unsexy,\" Kate said, giving Robin a peck on the lips to shut her up. \"Diapers and preschool and storks, ugh. I'd rather talk about this ad campaign. Do you have the videos ready and edited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you haven't actually...\" Robin's voice trailed off as Kate rubbed her breasts against her own. \"A-actually paid me yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stepped away and scoffed. \"I thought we were friends. You can wait on a little bit of money.\" She reached one hand under Robin's belly and gave it a teasing stroke with one finger. \"I let you sleep at my loft, don't I? Rent-free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-most nights,\" Robin choked, always amazed by Kate's ability to find that one perfect spot on a woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't be so ungrateful,\" Kate said, pulling her hand away and sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the exit to the clinic, Sarah and Monica were walking fast. Well, as fast as they could. \"I just cannot believe her,\" Sarah said, her whole body shaking. \"It's not enough for her to...to hurt me. She has to be cruel on top of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney says the rest of the day is called off so you can just take me home,\" Monica mumbled as she put her phone away barely looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst person I have ever met. Hands down. The absolute worst,\" Sarah spat. \"And she seems to bounce back pretty fast with that...inked up bruiser with a belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she moved on to me,\" Monica squeaked, stopping Sarah in place. \"She mentioned a...sporty ex-girlfriend she mocked a lot. And then she dumped me about a month ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed and took Monica's hands. \"I'm sorry, I should have asked you how you were doing. It's just...both of us dating Kate. What are the chances?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica shrugged, still looking down. \"She was my...my first. I felt so lucky, you know? She was so pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pretty, I'll give her that,\" Sarah huffed. \"With that olive skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her raven hair,\" Monica said. \"And her soft lips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right and her bulging breasts and her...curvy waist,\" Sarah said, feeling her mouth get a little dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, her belly button had that perfect thin, deep shape,\" Monica said, starting to blush as she turned to Sarah. \"A-and that way she would make you whisper her name before...before...\" The two women clashed together, arms and mouths intertwined as they piled into a bathroom and locked the door behind them, panting and whining as they went at one another with newfound energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at MegaGym, Emily stood on a scale near the locker room, sighing and playing with her brown curly hair. \"Maybe it's all of this. Once I get a haircut, I have to weigh less,\" Emily told herself as her other hand stroked her belly. But she didn't know who she was fooling. She was, somehow, six months pregnant despite only showing a few days ago and there were a lot of future gymnasts on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem?\" Lori asked as she struggled past her boss, a towel wrapped around her large chest. Because of her short height, Lori looked like one of the biggest of the main MegaGym staff despite carrying even fewer than Sarah. Her long brown hair shimmered thanks to a new flood of hormones and her tan skin was like a statue glowing in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it's the usual fears that come with being a fitness freak,\" Emily sighed as she stepped off the scale. \"I just didn't expect to gain <b>this much</b> weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya,\" Lori shrugged. \"At least it doesn't make swimming that much harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one upside,\" Emily nodded. \"But I need to put in a good showing at the fitness competition. This is our chance to stay in business and if the boss does a shitty job, how will that reflect on all of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you need to take Sarah and Nina's class,\" Lori said. \"They are kicking womens' big, plump asses down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Emily sighed. \"And the other problem is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lori asked as Emily's voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so damn horny,\" Emily whispered. \"I don't know if it's the hormones or what but it's like I'm a high schooler again and I'm not catching any guys with all this extra weight.\" She prodded the top of her stomach with her thumb, fearing looking at the scale again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if that's what you're looking for,\" Lori whispered back, leaning in. \"There's rumors of a...place in town where people who don't mind a little bump in the road get together. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed, always trying to stay professional but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it. Tell me when and where.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sigh, Sabrina waddled into the shower at MegaGym, muscles sore from mixing a thorough workout with pregnancy. She was never particularly interested in physical fitness, relying on good genes to stay trim and curvy, so today's exercises took a lot out of her. Sabrina clutched a towel to her body, astounded at how many women were walking around naked in the open locker room. And with swollen, pregnant stomachs no less. Of course, many of them could be mistaken for potbellies. Women with Sabrina's size were more uncommon, which sent a distinct shiver of worry down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into a curtained stall and hissed as the cold water hit her body. Sabrina bit her lip and waited for it to heat up as she glanced at the other curtains. The silhouettes of big-bellied women were obvious and she blushed, placing one hand against her own big midsection. Earlier in the day, Sabrina started to feel movement inside her, counting three distinct forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets,\" Sabrina murmured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" the woman in the stall next to her said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, nothing,\" Sabrina replied. \"Just...I'm carrying triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice to hear,\" the other woman said, poking her head through the curtain to reveal Peggy's face. \"I'm pregnant with twins. You look like you're carrying it well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Sabrina blushed, coyly hiding her breasts as she turned her belly toward Peggy. \"It came as a bit of a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too. My ex-husband had to mess up my life one more time, it seems,\" Peggy sighed, her belly pushing through the curtain into a tight, round bulge. \"I was going to tell him but it seems his current girlfriend is expecting as well and...I can't throw a wrench into her life just to satisfy myself. I can take care of these babies on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good way to see it, I suppose,\" Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides, she's quite a bit younger. She'll need all the help she can get,\" Peggy chuckled. \"I'm sorry, I just wanted someone to chat with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please, by all means,\" Sabrina smiled, giving a light stage bow. \"I am always happy to play audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy narrowed her eyes, her smile getting a little nervous. \"Alright then.\" She went back into her own shower and Sabrina leaned back, letting the water wash over her as she thought <i>it could be a lot worse</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished washing up, Sabrina slowly changed and headed out to the gym, failing to find Sarah for a ride back home. Sabrina searched and came across Nina. At least Nina was always easy to find. \"Have you seen Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" Nina panted, stroking her massive belly and wincing with each kick and cramp. \"I think she took her break. By my count, she won't be back for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" Sabrina sighed, looking back at Nina's moon of a stomach, the impressions of feet and fists obvious. \"A lot of commotion in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're active, just like their momma,\" Nina said with a pained smile, giving her belly a light pat, which only elicited more tantrums. \"But any day now they should be here. Hopefully they're a little calmer outside of the womb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina smiled, placing her hand against her own belly and patting it in rhythm with Nina's. \"I'm sure they will be in good hands.\" Sabrina turned and headed for the nearest bus stop, standing next to many other expectant men and women. Once on board, it was bedlum with all seats taken up by pregnant people and other big-bellied passengers having to stand. Sabrina was one of those, pushing past bulging riders as her bright red hair tossed around rubbing against others. When she finally came to a stop, she saw a familiar face sitting in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...Sabrina, right?\" Gisele said, both hands resting on her belly. \"From the improv class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word, yes,\" Sabrina said, turning the theatrical voice up to 11 in front of a fellow classmate. \"And you're Gisele, if I recall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only,\" she grinned. \"I got to leave my work early today so I thought I'd stop by the gym, give someone I know a...a piece of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's always good to exercise,\" Sabrina said as Gisele began to stand and waddle to MegaGym, one hand reaching underneath her belly for support. \"You were fortunate to find a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't hard. I'm a model. People will do anything for me,\" she said, winking to a pregnant young man standing near the back. \"It makes acting much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, beauty and acting go hand in hand,\" Sabrina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have to make sure and exercise so it doesn't go away with...age,\" Gisele smiled, giving Sabrina a once-over before waddling off the bus. Sabrina's heart sank and she felt her cheeks burning brighter than her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold the door!\" Lori said from outside, hurrying inside and pushing through the crowd with her belly. Once Gisele left, it was a mad scramble for the last seat. \"Oh hey, Sabrina!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lori! A day full of friendly faces,\" Sabrina said. \"You work at the MegaGym, do you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Lori said, visibly a little irritated with Sabrina's dramatic persona. \"Hey, sorry about us kinda fighting in improv class a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, we were filled with the passion of the artform,\" Sabrina said. \"And I have been thinking more about our dual show together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you'd still want to do that?\" Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I have been getting inspiration from the muses themselves,\" Sabrina said. \"What if we included a third character? While you and I play mother and daughter, I am also divorced and my ex-husband has a young, pregnant girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very dramatic,\" Lori grinned. \"You really have a knack for this, Sabrina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smiled and blushed, putting one hand on Lori's shoulder. \"With kind words such as those, how could I ever stay cross with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the gym, Sarah and Monica waddled in from the parking lot, Monica's eyes wide with hesitation. \"I don't really workout,\" Monica said quietly. \"I mean, I jog sometimes but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to go,\" Sarah said, puffing her belly out in pride. \"We can make a day of it. Now do you want to start with some cardio or would you like to get to work on those little arms of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarah Richardson!\" Gisele shouted across the gym. Sarah turned to see the dazzling Latina model waddle over, their bellies pressing together. \"Finally. I have a lot I want to say to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica knew Gisele blamed Britney for Xpect and her pregnancy but thought she might have connected the dots and shifted blame to Sarah as well. \"Hey, Gisele, how about we go talk in private-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to say it now,\" Gisele smirked, rolling up her shirt to touch her naked brown belly to Sarah's big pink stomach. \"You did this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It was an honest mistake,\" Sarah squeaked, her head still a bit jumbled from her run-in with Kate. \"I didn't know that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Xpect would make me pregnant?\" Gisele shouted so several other gym-goers could hear and turn their head. \"That's quite the coincidence because everything seems to have worked out for you and your roommate since we got knocked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gisele, don't yell,\" Monica said, grabbing Gisele's arm and trying to pull her away from her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I just want to say one thing,\" Gisele said, her smile growing as she let the silence hang. Then, in an instant, Gisele leapt up to hug Sarah and give her a big kiss on the lips. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was mute with shock, her eyes wide as she glanced at Monica then back at Gisele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've wanted to be a mom since I was a little girl but everyone always told me it would be impossible in the modeling world so I always held off! But thanks to you, I pushed right through and now everything is turning out even better than I could have dreamed!\" Gisele squealed, stroking her naked belly in big, fast circles. \"Thank you! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...welcome?\" Sarah said. \"I mean, it was an accident but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to put on a tough face in front of the other girls, you know?\" Gisele said, wiping a few joyful tears out of her face. \"But I just had to say thank you directly. You don't know what you've done!\" She cackled with delight and looked around. \"And you know what? I think I might actually sign up here. Be around other, lovely moms-to-be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dads,\" a passing Jim grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gisele hurried off into the gym, Monica walked up beside Sarah and put one arm around her girlfriend's shoulders. \"Do you think anyone heard her?\" Monica said, glancing around at people whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure,\" Sarah replied with a gulp. \"But let's focus on the important thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Monica asked as they turned to face one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still getting a workout and you can't get out of that,\" Sarah smiled, kissing Monica on the nose and dragging her toward the weight room. Meanwhile, rumors were already spreading throughout MegaGym about Xpect and Sarah's role in it. Some were appreciative, some were angry, some were confused, some were in denial. But the thing about rumors is they build and they fester, ready to spread across a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Sarah and Monica worked out for the rest of the afternoon, the rumors spread far and wide, permeating the city with a rich layer of chaos. The stronger that chaos got, the more people could swear they heard a dark laughter coming from the new cans of Xpect Xtreme that were being unloaded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>12/20 notes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha Hamilton took a deep breath and shook out her limbs. \"Easy, easy, you're at work,\" Trisha repeated to herself. She couldn't let the mounting concerns she had about her husband's infidelity and their upcoming dinner tonight with the Smiths next door, on top of her own anxieties with being a mother again while raising two pregnant teenagers, get in the way of her brand new job. And she was meeting with another employee at the lab and gossip around Trionic Chemicals was this woman could be a little...testy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha pushed through the doorway into the records room, her belly not yet big enough to open the door without her arms, and waddled toward the sound of typing fingers. \"Hello, my name is Trisha Hamilton. Are you Diana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana pushed her glasses back up as she turned in her stool, away from the computer. Her belly was like a second desk between the two of them, growing so massive lately that it barely fit between the walls and the tables. Trisha thought she had gotten big when she was pregnant with Laci and Maci but this woman was on a whole different level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Diana said, wincing as she stood up and moved toward Trisha, her belly so big she could have stuffed the pregnant mother in there with room to spare. \"I'm Diana Larsen. Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I'm here to help you,\" Trisha said, blinking quickly. \"Sorry, just a little surprised. I didn't expect you to be so...\" Trisha could not have been more obvious with her gawking at Diana's belly so she snapped her head up. \"Young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thank you,\" Diana said, breaking a smile and adjusting her glasses. \"Yeah, when people hear I'm the chemical engineer here, it surprises them until they hear me start talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't meant to imply anything or...distrust you,\" Trisha said with a sigh. \"Sorry, pregnancy brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana furrowed her brow and leaned forward, trying to see Trisha's belly past her own. Sure enough, there was a bulge there but it was hard for Diana to spot in her current state. \"I know what you mean. So, you're new here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have a Master's in bio-chemistry but I've been a stay at home mom for a while,\" Trisha said, placing one hand back on her round stomach. \"I had planned to come back this week but hadn't planned on these two showing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean by that too,\" Diana sighed. \"So you're going to help me go through these journal articles and sort it all out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm here for!\" Trisha grinned, trying to put on a strong face. \"Though I'm surprised a chemical engineer is doing this sort of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" Diana grumbled. \"In fact, how about I give you a little private tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tour? I don't know...it's a little late in the day,\" Trisha said as Diana started to push her with her humungous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I need to get out of the office and get into some excitement just like anyone else,\" Diana chuckled. \"Maybe having you around can give me an excuse.\" Once down the hall, Diana's eyes started to light up, remembering the good ol' days of hurrying around with samples, looking through microscopes, and learning new things every day. But as Diana turned the corner for the main floor, Thomas was there, arms crossed, looking annoyed. \"Tom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas turned around, looking a lot happier when he saw her and nearly leapt into a hug but stopped himself when he saw Trisha next to her. \"*ahem* Ah, Dr. Larsen, I see you didn't get the memo about the change of plans either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What change? Why are you talking like that?\" Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas cleared his throat again and tried to talk casually. \"A-Apparently some big chemical company came in and bought a big swath of our storage tanks. All the analysis on it is being done by them and even the floor is off-limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off limits? We're the engineers and researchers. How could we be prevented from even going in?\" Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas shrugged. \"Guess Trionic is getting a lot of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, every day with this place it's something new,\" Diana groaned, turning slowly to Trisha. \"I guess the tour stops here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I should be getting home anyway,\" Trisha said, checking her watch. \"You can help me learn about working here tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Trisha,\" Diana grinned. \"And if I need some parenting advice, I hope I can count on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'm the best person for advice. You haven't met my daughters,\" Trisha sighed, patting her stomach. \"But I'd be happy to chat. Have a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Diana waved, turning to Thomas. \"So, got any plans tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I might...see what you were thinking,\" Thomas said, reaching one hand over to trace his finger down the long curve of Diana's belly. \"What do you feel up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything,\" Diana purred, pushing Thomas up against the wall with her maternal swell. \"I'm angry again and I need some way to let it out.\" Thomas gulped. \"Hey, don't be too scared. You liked it last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night you weren't as...big,\" Thomas whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana chuckled and reached one hand out to his cheek. \"You know, my friend is a fitness instructor. Maybe she could toughen you up so I don't break you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood was never great at the Hamilton house. Maci and Laci would always fight, David would either be trying to impress them with his gleaned knowledge of \"youth-speak\" or getting annoyed himself, and Trisha would be silently mediating things behind the scenes. But tonight, it was especially bad. David was pacing around, nerves on edge over how tonight's dinner would go with two women he'd impregnated joining his wife and children, plus his boss. And Tami's husband too, he guessed, but David wasn't all that worried about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Trisha was quietly making dinner with help from Laci, her constant studying of rituals actually making her a pretty good cook, harboring her own fears about her husband's infidelity. She knew he had a habit of flirting but Trisha stayed with him, thinking deep down he was a good man who was taking care of them. The new house was part of that promise. But if he was actually having an affair, while she and her daughters were pregnant...Trisha would leave him. She'd made up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaci was pacing around so much you'd think she was trying to stave off contractions. But she was wrestling with the knowledge that drinking Xpect, a stupid little energy drink, was responsible for the two fetuses rapidly growing inside her virgin womb. Same for her twin sister, same for her mother, same for her father, same for probably half of the pregnant people she'd seen around town in the past week. How was she going to bring it up? Laci already laughed her off but what did she owe them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Laci, she was a little less concerned. Sure, she was still heartbroken over Robin cheating on her with some other bitch, although if Laci actually knew Kate she might switch from worshiping the devil and worship the PR exec's evil instead. But what was bothering Laci lately was the funny feeling in her belly. Not her pregnancy \u2013 she was well accustomed to that now \u2013 but something...else. Different than nausea, a kind of bubbling. Little did Laci realize her father was feeling it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's everything coming in here?\" David asked, poking his head in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Trisha and Laci replied in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not...mad I ended up inviting two of my bosses here last minute, are you?\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was going to make big portions anyway,\" Trisha said. \"With cravings, you never know how much you'll need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" David sighed as the doorbell rang. He hurried over, hoping Mr. Hicks might come first. No such luck as Karley's pregnant gut pushed his own out of the way and into his home. \"Karley...welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is a...cute place\" Karley sighed. \"I think my children could use something a bit nicer, though.\" She turned around and smirked at David, placing one hand over her growing uterus. \"Or should I say our children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your voice down,\" David hissed. \"And for your information, we're moving to a new house soon as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how well those plans will go,\" Karley chuckled. \"You haven't told them yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming, just hang on,\" David sighed, the doorbell ringing again. David swiveled on his heel to let Mr. Hicks in. \"Mr. Hicks! So good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you too! What a nice place\" Mr. Hicks gleamed. \"I've said it before but being a family man is very important to being an executive and by the looks of things, you have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" David said, almost reflexively doing the bow he once gave to a Japanese business group. \"W-well I hope you enjoy the dinner a-and see just how much of a family man I can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't miss it,\" Mr. Hicks said, putting one hand on his pregnant gut. \"I don't have much of a choice when it comes to wanting dinner.\" David laughed politely but as his boss walked past him, the wheels began to turn. If this went well, he would get a promotion. Not just a promotion but he would be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turned back to Karley and loomed over her, their bellies touching. \"Better not get too eager,\" David whispered. \"Because before long, <u>I'll</u> be your boss.\" As David walked away and Karley looked at him with intrigue, the door opened again and in waddled Tami and Andrew, both wearing big coats to hide their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, welcome inside,\" Trisha said, heaving her belly forward to put the last dish on the table. Her eyes flashed around the room, not expecting such a big audience for her confrontation but here goes nothing. \"I guess it's time for dinner.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trisha kept a firm smile on her face, masking her discomfort at the fact that she was hosting such a large dinner, all while knowing her husband was having an affair. She felt a light bump as one of her twin fetuses shifted inside her belly and Trisha felt unsettled knowing she was carrying the children of an adulterous man. As for whose babies David was carrying inside him...that was another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laci, stop playing with your phone,\" Trisha hissed to her goth daughter, who was moving her hands under the table. \"We have guests over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not on my phone,\" Laci said in her usual snotty tone, pushing back her chair to reveal her hands frantically rubbing her exposed pregnant middle. \"I'm trying to calm the babies down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha's face twitched, not yet comfortable with both of her daughters being pregnant at the same time as her. And their pleadings that they had yet to \"do the deed\" to get this way only bothered her further. \"You are not the only pregnant wom...only pregnant person at this table and no one else is fidgeting with their stomachs. It's not appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going crazy inside there. I don't know what else to do,\" Laci protested. \"And Mom, when half the city is pregnant, 'appropriate' goes right out the fucking window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute kids,\" Karley chuckled, jabbing her fork into the meat on her plate and watching it bleed. \"Hope you learned your mistakes and you can be a better parent in the future.\" She shifted under her seat some to bounce her own pregnant belly off of David's knee, trying to remind him of <i>all</i> the babies he had on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, David, you do have...lovely children,\" Mr. Hicks said, looking between the sullen face of Laci and the frightened face of Maci. \"Do twins run in your family? It just seems like such a coincidence that your wife is expecting twins again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not the only one,\" Maci muttered under her breath, earning her an annoyed gaze from her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, not that I know of,\" David gulped, almost standing in his seat when addressing his boss. This dinner had a lot of his future business prospects hanging in the balance. And with his plans of moving into a new house and getting a better real estate job possibly being demolished by the wrecking balls of the Hamilton pregnant bellies, this could be his chance to make it. \"Trisha, any twins in your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only twins in my family are the ones that have been in me,\" Trisha chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a twin brother,\" Andrew said, putting all eyes on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a twin sister,\" Andrew laughed. \"They're each other's twins, though. When I was born, it was just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of a kid,\" Tami smiled, patting her husband on the back. \"And Laci, Maci, trust me. I've met Andrew's siblings and they fight just as much as you two. Must be a twin thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...hey,\" Laci said, raising a dyed-black eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only <b>we</b> get to talk about what twins do or don't do,\" Maci said. \"And who says we fight? You don't know us. You're not a part of this family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Tami said, rolling her eyes and whispering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sisters. We get along great,\" Laci said. \"When I found out I was pregnant, who was there for me? Maci. When we asked that bra model down the hall for a pregnancy test, who backed me up? Maci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Britney did what now?\" Trisha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I need someone to ask advice on pregnancy clothes, who do I ask? My twin sister, Laci,\" Maci said, puffing out her growing chest in pride. \"So yeah, we're twins but we do damn well together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see!\" Mr. Hicks said, grinning wide. David gave a nervous nod of agreement and wiped his sweaty forehead. Was it just his discomfort at having <u>two</u> women he'd impregnated besides his wife at the dinner table or was his stomach genuinely acting up? He knew he was pregnant but he was feeling a lot different lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes me wonder how my twins will behave once the time comes,\" Karley mused, pushing back in her chair and stroking her pregnant middle, her shirt clinging tightly to her bulge. \"They seem quite calm in there, though the doctors say I'm not at the final months yet so I'm sure the kicking will come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Months? At this rate, I think I'll be ready to pop in a few days,\" Tami sighed, prodding her swollen middle as she felt a tiny kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whichever is fine with me. I regret waiting too long to have children,\" Karley said, hints of an actual warm smile showing on her often cold, calculating face. \"Though the men I chose to marry...did not make it easy for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs men to get pregnant?\" Laci chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Karley chuckled back, eyes meeting the young goth's. \"Who gets to choose who knocks them up?\" Laci blushed. Powerful, sultry, clearly evil. This Karley lady was the closest Laci had ever gotten to an actual devil (with her mind trying to block out Kate). Laci kind of dug it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're getting a little off-track,\" Trisha said, her voice wavering. \"Is everyone enjoying dinner at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's very good,\" Andrew said with a grin. \"Thank you, Trisha. Not sure why I have cravings but me and the little ones enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...welcome,\" Trisha said slowly, her suspicions about Andrew not going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I go to my room?\" Laci whined, pressing both palms firmly against her belly. \"It really feels weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's just the babies hiccuping or it's gas. Trust me, that happens plenty,\" Trisha said. \"Now, if we want to have dessert-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trisha, actually, I'd like to go lie down too,\" David said, one hand on the small of his back and one on his rounding middle. \"I don't know if it's the...you know...but something feels odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're like to get out of here,\" Trisha grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" David said, his face flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, jesus, what are you doing?\" Maci mumbled. \"Don't embarrass us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't embarrass...I'm the one being humiliated here!\" Trisha finally snapped, standing up in one quick motion and clutching her swollen belly instantly. \"Look at me, slaving over a kitchen after working all day, all while carrying the babies of a...a cheater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci and Maci both locked eyes, not needing their \"twin instincts\" to know what the other was thinking. Everyone at the dinner table started to stir as well, but for different reasons. \"Trisha, what are you doing?\" David murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't treat me like I'm stupid! I know! And you even had them sit at my dinner table!\" Trisha said, tears starting to well up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trisha, please,\" Tami said slowly. \"I can explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain how your husband is having an affair with my husband?\" Trisha shouted. Now the room really went silent. Every jaw dropped, especially Tami and Karley's. They didn't see it going in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trisha,\" David began to say, his head spinning with confusion. \"I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit it!\" Andrew said, leaping up. \"I'm in love with David, okay? But nothing ever happened!\" He took Tami's hand and squeezed it tight. \"Tami, I love you but...I've been living a lie. We've only been married a few months but I only realized it once we moved next door to the Hamiltons. I'm gay and nothing can change that! That's why I didn't want to start a family with you! I didn't want to put our children in that position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tami said, her eyes getting wide. \"But David, he...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" Maci said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Laci winced, now standing up and clutching her belly. \"I really feel...oh crap...\" In an instant, Laci's pregnant belly surged forward, banging against the table and knocking over plates and glasses. At the same time, David was grabbing at his belly as it grew and tore his shirt apart. Both staggered into their respective bedrooms and shut the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David? Laci?\" Trisha said, running one hand through her hair while the other pet her belly. Tears were pouring down her face. \"Um, Maci, check on your sister. I'll...um...\" Without another word, Trisha hurried into the bedroom she shared with her unfaithful husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew?\" Tami said slowly, touching one hand to her husband's face. He flinched away from her palm. \"Andy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should...talk back home,\" he said, pulling his wife away. When the front door shut, it was just Karley and Mr. Hicks sitting alone. Karley was speechless, not sure what to make of the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hicks sat silent for a few moments, tapping his fingers on his own pregnant belly. Finally, he turned to Karley and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I do these family dinners,\" he said. \"Never know what you're going to learn.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Laci?\" Maci said quietly, pushing the door with her own prominent twin pregnant belly and walking into the room she shared with her twin sister. Laci, the goth of the pair, was sitting in front of her makeshift altar with both hands wrapped around her massive stomach. She was rocking back and forth, given leverage thanks to her heavily padded rear, and stroked her belly. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay? Sure I'm okay,\" Laci said, flashing a forced grin. \"I wanted to carry more satanic spawn in my womb, now I'm practically bursting at the seams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on your way there,\" Maci said, leaning her hips back so she could sit down next to her sister, balancing her now much smaller baby bump. \"Sarah and Britney have you beat in terms of size and they're still in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci laughed, her bleats of joy gradually transitioning into tears. With a sigh, Maci stretched out one arm and let Laci fall against her shoulder and chest, hugging her sister closely. Maci pet her sister's hair, their pregnant bellies touching and slightly rubbing together. \"I wish...I wish Robin was here for moments like this,\" Laci sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Maci said. \"I mean, I don't <i>exactly</i> know. You have more luck with relationships than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaci sniffled and chuckled again. \"If only Mom and Dad could overhear you. Then they'd really believe your belly came out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think tonight proved to them that something is up,\" Maci said, looking down at Laci's middle. \"But damn...you are huge now, Laci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Laci said, smiling before more tears started to fall. \"Robin's photos made my tummy look so good. Without them, I look so swollen and ugly. Like a beached whale...in tacky, out of style goth shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't need her for that,\" Maci shushed. \"Aunt Becky could be trying to get you with her shaky phone camera and you'd still look like a supermodel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Laci said, wiping her nose and eyes, black eyeliner running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. You're my twin sister after all so we look the same,\" Maci chuckled. Laci laughed and bumped her sister with her hips. The additional pregnant weight knocked Maci over a little too much and she rolled on the floor. The two helped each other up and hugged tightly, their bellies never big enough to keep them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice you didn't say anything about my clothes,\" Laci said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point about that. You're the only goth I know of anymore,\" Maci smirked. A little more twin ribbing made everything feel normal again. \"So how many babies now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like four,\" Laci sighed, patting the top of her stomach. \"But I don't think it's a demon anymore...you might have a point about that energy drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, someone believes me,\" Maci grunted, rolling her eyes. \"Wait...why do you say that?\" Laci grinned nervously. \"You drank more of it, didn't you?\" Laci kept grinning, looking around the room silently. \"And Dad?\" Laci whistled nonchalantly. \"Laci!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How was I supposed to know it would actually do anything?\" Laci said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's so stupid! Who ever heard of a drink that knocks people up? Next thing you know, I'm going to find a...a magical coin on the side of the road that gives me bigger tits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two twins got back to arguing, Trisha sat on the edge of her bed, stroking the side of her belly. The two twins she carried in there weren't getting along all that well either. On the other side of the bed, David was tucked in tight, moaning quietly while he touched one hand to his newly enlarged pregnant middle. \"Y-you're sure I can sleep here tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha let out a long sigh. \"I can't exactly make someone pregnant sleep on the couch, man or woman.\" She picked up the bedsheets and slunk into the bed, putting a few pillows between her and David. \"But tomorrow, I'm going to get some answers. I may have misjudged the...who, but you have not been faithful to this family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was quiet for a few seconds, his mind racing. \"I have worked hard for this family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it in the morning. I need to sleep. Being pregnant is...tiring,\" Trisha said, switching off the lamp, not even giving her husband a \"good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few doors over, Sarah and Monica were laying in bed, bellies touching, as Monica squeezed Sarah's forearm. \"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I'm not even flexing yet,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, for real?\" Monica gasped, giving another firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow, kidding! I am flexing so it's really tight,\" Sarah laughed with a wince. Monica let out a snorting laugh and leaned in, kissing Sarah on the lips. After they smooched, the two pregnant women kept their lips together but looked into each other's eyes, gleaming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...are we...a couple now?\" Monica asked, her voice barely rising above a squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like girlfriends?\" Sarah murmured back. \"I'd love to start calling you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica started to speak, stopping herself a few times before getting it all out. \"Kate...thought it was too silly to say that. She said only high schoolers use terms like boyfriend and girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah chuckled. \"She pulled the same shit with me.\" She nuzzled up against Monica and let out a deep sigh. \"It's funny...I'm kinda happy you and her were a thing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" Monica said, petting Sarah's hair. \"She hurt me in ways I can't really put into words. But you know exactly what it was like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're like puzzles missing pieces. And we fit right into each other,\" Sarah said back, kissing Monica on the belly. \"I want you to be my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica bit her bottom lip, making the freckles on her tan face bounce and dance. \"Say it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica, I want you to be my girlfriend,\" Sarah moaned. \"My beautiful, pregnant girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always,\" Monica said, leaning back into the bed so Sarah could crawl over her, moving her tongue and lips all over the model's naked body. \"Forever and ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to be pregnant forever and ever?\" Sarah said with a little laugh, kissing Monica on the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that would give us more time to buy cribs,\" Monica said, squealing as Sarah wrapped her lips around Monica's nipples.</span></div></div>",

But a few minutes later, he groaned and pinched his temples as he tried to wrap his head around his studies.  He would much rather play video games, but he knew that final exams were coming up in 8 days and it was crucial that he had to be ready for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!  You gotta see this!\"  Rick shouted as he entered the room, holding a drink can in each hand.  Rick is Jason's roommate.  Rick is much more sociable than Jason, always going to parties and trying to pick up girls while Jason just preferred playing games, but they got along well despite their differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell me what it is later, Rick?  I'm kinda busy right now.\"  Jason replied with a bit of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, man!  I just wanna show you somethin' real quick, please?\"  Rick asked.  Jason then gave out a sigh and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what is it?\"  Rick then gave Jason one of the cans which is colored pink and blue and has a label that says \"Xpect\" and below that are words that say: \"Fills you with life!  Product of Yaral Industries\"  Jason raised an eyebrow and said, \"Just what am I looking at here Rick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think it's some kind of energy drink.  But one of the guys at Alpha Beta Gamma got a whole bunch of these drinks and was just giving them away to everybody on campus so I had to get a couple of cans.  And besides, this'll probably help ya stay up so you can study more.\" Rick explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Rick.  I'm not a big fan of energy drinks.\"  Jason replied, unsure about the strange drink that Rick brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't know until try it, dude.  I also saw that girl you like so much with a can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Heather?\" Jason said surprisingly.  Heather was a sweet and beautiful girl who shared many of Jason's classes.  Jason had developed a crush on her since he first saw her, but he was just too nervous to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man.  It's gotta be good if your crush is trying it, right?\"  Rick replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'll try it.  But just this once.\"  Jason said as he and Rick cracked open their cans.  Jason then raised his can and said, \"Cheers, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\"  Rick smiled as the two of them chugged down their cans of Xpect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that stuff is nasty!  I can't believe I drank it all.\" Jason groaned as he was suddenly hit by nausea.  He covered his mouth with his hands as he rushed to the bathroom before dumping the contents of his stomach into the toilet bowl.  Rick chuckled at Jason's vomiting and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you are such a lightweight.\"  Even though he was starting to feel nauseous himself.</span></div></div>",

He tried to stand up so he could turn it in to his teacher, but he grunted as he quickly learned that he was stuck.  He looked down and was shocked to see that his stomach was impossibly huge and round and his belly was wedging him to his desk.  He looked around for help, but saw that all of his class mates also had huge, round bellies!  Although, most of them didn't have bellies as big as his, he saw a few that were wedged in their desks like he was.  He spotted one student in particular, Heather, and he saw that the two of them have the biggest bellies in the entire classroom. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gasped as he suddenly woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what a crazy dream!\" He said.  He shrugged that dream off as a side effect of that stupid Xpect Rick had him drink.  He looked at his digital clock, he saw that he had a little over half an hour to get to his first class, so he got up, brushed his teeth, combed his hair, put on some new clothes, and have some breakfast really quick before going to class.  He vaguely noticed that he had a bigger breakfast than usual, but he shrugged it off as he headed for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first class was Chemistry with Ms. Ella Smith.  At age 27, Ella Smith was one of the youngest professors on campus, but her youth belies her vast intellect on the subject she teaches,  Chemistry was one of Jason's favorite classes, not just because he's doing so well in that class, but also because he and Heather are lab partners.  When Heather showed up and sat next to Jason, he decided to start a conversation with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Heather, how are you today?\" He asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, not too good.  I've been feeling sick to my stomach lately and I lost sleep over this crazy dream I had last night.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Me too.\" He replied.</span></div></div>",

She was incredibly strict, and her negative demeanor led her to still being single.  In addition, most of the students disliked her.  The only redeeming factor of the class was that he sat next to Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs class ended, he decided to take a leap of faith.  \"Hey, Heather...\" Jason began.  \"Yeah?\" she asked.  \"Uh, I was just wondering if you were busy tonight?\" he asked, cringing at what her response would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused.  \"Well, I do have a paper due tomorrow, but tomorrow I'm free.

But since he had been getting good grades in his English class and that he hadn't skipped any of his classes this semester, he decided that skipping class to get something to eat would be worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making his way to the cafeteria, Jason picked up and filled it up with some of his favorite foods, like a hot dog with mustard, two slices of pepperoni pizza, a small bag of chips, and a cup filled with root beer.  While looking for a place to sit, he soon spots a very familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather!?  What are you doing here?\" Jason said as he approached her and then sat next to her on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason?  I should be asking you the same question.  Well I came down here because I just felt so hungry and I couldn't bear going through another class without eating something.  So I thought, \"screw it\" and I came down here.\" Heather explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Me too!\" Jason remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.  First, I threw up yesterday and now my stomach is growling like crazy!\" Heather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threw up yesterday, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I talked to one of my friends about it and she said that a lot of people on campus were feeling the same way.  She said that there might be some sort of stomach thing going around.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope it's not serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it is, it'll probably fade in a day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Jason said before the two of them started digging into their lunches.  When he looked at his hot dog though, a strange urge came over him.  Then without thinking, he took his mustard-laden frank off of its bun and sandwiched it between his two slices of pizza.  He then chowed down on the hot dog-pizza sandwich with reckless abandon.  After he finished eating the concoction, he saw Heather was giving him a strange look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man.  I'm so sorry Heather, I didn't know what came over me!\" Jason blurted out with his cheeks red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, really!  I just never seen someone eat something like that before.\" Heather replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it taste good?\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Well uh, it actually tasted pretty good.\" Jason answered with a startled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smiled upon hearing his answer, which helped Jason become more at ease.  Soon after the two college students finished eating, Jason stood up and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I gotta get going.  We're still up for tomorrow, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.  See you later!\" Heather replied as she waved him good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" Jason said, waving back at her as he left the cafeteria.  When he leaves, he wonders what he is going to do next since he doesn't have any more classes to go to today.</span></div></div>",

Besides, the way I'm feeling I probably wouldn't have gone anyway\" Rick replied.  Professor Luddington was a psychology teacher from England.  Because of her accent, the students playfully poked fun at her.  She was married and had three kids, and was in her early 40s, but looked ten years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's weird.  The legend goes that she's never been sick in her life, right?\" Jason asked.  \"Yup.\"  Rick responded.  \"Wanna play some Zombie Massacre Mania 2.5 Ultra Turbo Edition?\" Jason asked.  \"Not tonight, I think I'm gonna get some sleep.\"  he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jason decided to take a shower.  He removed his clothes, hopped in, and hopped out minutes later.  \"Record time.\" he noted.  As he dried off, he got a look at himself in the mirror.  To his bewilderment, his belly had a slight curve to it, well, more of a curve than usual.  \"Must be from eating so much earlier today...\"he said.  He felt the bulge, and noticed that it was tight.  In addition, he had grown what looked to be the beginning of manboobs.  \"I guess I gotta watch what I eat.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on his bed and grabbed his laptop, trying to study for exams.  Due to Rick's loud snoring, Jason decided to listen to some music.  He set it to shuffle, and let his iPhone do the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy don't turn away, you know that I'm so scared--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*skip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*skip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy won't let you weep--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, screw it.\" he said, turning the music off.

But luckily, he didn't have any classes today, so he made a mental note to himself to wake up earlier tomorrow.  But when he got up, he noticed that he felt heavier than usual.  He looked down and was surprised to see that his curved belly had grown into something of a pot belly, and that his new man-boobs looked noticeably puffier than they were last night.  He also felt an erection inside his boxers, which wasn't unusual for him because he woke up with one every morning since puberty, but now he could barely see it due to his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Jason said to himself before he tried to shake thoughts of his belly out of his head and focused on his date with Heather today.  He then became excited and a little nervous after remembering that he had a date with Heather.  He went over to his dresser and saw Rick still snoring in his bed.  Normally, Jason would've woken him up, But he remembered Rick say that he didn't have any classes today either.  So he decided to let him sleep as he got out a set of clean clothes and proceeded to go change in the bathroom.  As he put on his clothes, he noticed that his t-shirt was feeling pretty tight around his belly and he had a bit of trouble buttoning his jeans due to not only his belly, but also an slight,unexpected tightness in his hips.  After he managed to get fully clothed, Jason sighed as he had to accept the fact that he needed to get bigger clothes.</span></div></div>",

He walked to the nearest clothing store and grabbed a few roomy shirts and sweaters. After trying them on, he determined that they covered his pot belly well enough for the time being, but if it got bigger, he'd be in a bit of trouble.  Jason made his purchases and exited the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the building, his stomach let out a large rumble. Realizing that there was a restaurant nearby, he hurried towards it. Jason also noticed that his ankles were feeling a little sore, so it would be a good opportunity to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the building, Jason heard a familiar voice. \"Mr. White, funny running into you here.\"  Jason turned to see Professor Freeman, his English professor. He was a man in his mid 60s, as his grey hair helped display.  \"Professor Freeman! Sorry I missed class yesterday, I was feeling under the weather. I'll be there tomorrow there, for sure.\" Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you had that energy drink that's been going around campus. Energy drinks in general are terrible for you, Jason. I haven't had one in twenty years.\" the professor said. \"Yeah, I think I'll steer clear of it from now on.\" Jason said. \"Have you been preparing for the exam?\" he asked.  \"Every night.\" Jason replied. \"Good to hear.  You have tremendous potential, Jason. I'm expecting big things from you.\" Professor Freeman said, leaving the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason ordered a large lunch and devoured it. He also noticed a strange stirring sensation in his belly, but brushed it off, thinking that it was just his meal digesting. He returned to his dorm, and began to get ready for his date with Heather.</span></div></div>",

Jason agreed, and now he's standing outside said restaurant, waiting for Heather to show up while wearing some of the clothes he bought at the mall earlier today, including a plus-sized set of jeans and a large flannel shirt which did a good job at concealing his man-boobs.  He was about to check the time on his smart phone when he saw a car being parked that he quickly recognized being Heather's car.  As he saw her get out of her car, he noticed that she had grown a pot belly like he has and the jeans and t-shirt she was wearing seemed pretty tight on her, not that Jason minded that much as she approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jason.  Sorry for getting dressed up like this, today's laundry day and this is all I had to wear.\"  Heather said apologetically as she greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, really.  Now would you like to go inside so we can eat?\" Jason asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\" Heather replied as she grasped Jason's hand before they entered the restaurant together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon got to their table and quickly decided what they wanted to order.  Jason ordered some lasagna while Heather ordered the chicken parmesan, the restaurant was also offering all-you-can-eat spaghetti that night so they didn't hesitate in ordering that.  It seemed to take forever for their food to arrive, but when it came, they didn\u2019t hesitate to stuff themselves silly as they devoured their meals as well as a few extra bowlfuls of spaghetti which were doused in sauce and topped with delicious meatballs.  After they both paid for the bill and left a tip, they left the restaurant while cradling their full stomachs as they wondered where to take their date next.</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s go!\u201d  Jason said excitedly before they went back to their cars and drove back to campus.  Jason then led Heather to his dorm.  When they went inside, Jason looked around for Rick but he couldn't find him anywhere.  He then saw a note at the desk that Rick left saying he\u2019ll be hanging out with friends and he\u2019ll be out all night.

No, I think you look very pretty!  Besides, I\u2019m in the same boat as you, so I should be asking you the same thing.\u201d  Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you're ugly at all.

Me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let me prove it.\u201d Heather said before she leaned her head towards Jason and then kissed him square on the lips.  Soon, they both gasped for breath as they let go of their surprisingly passionate kiss.  Their libidos quickly took over as they took off their clothes and they made sweet, sweet love to one another.  They kept at it until they reached the peak of their pleasure around half an hour later, they then quickly felt exhausted and they ended up sleeping in each other\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He swore that he could make out kicks and punches rolling across his gargantuan middle. Mr Freeman stood at the front of the room with a stern look on his face. \"...big things from you, Mr. White.\" he kept repeating over and over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason woke up groggily. \"What the...another crazy dream...\"he grumbled. He tried to open his eyes, but was unable to due to the heavy layer of gunk that had formed on his eyelids as he slept. Jason felt much, much heavier as he slowly rose from his bed. He walked (or waddled, more like) to the bathroom to wash his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the sink on and let the water wash away the eye gunk.  Jason let out a gasp as he saw his reflection in the mirror. His belly had once again grown, making him look nearly full term with a single baby. In addition, his belly button was dangerously close to popping out, and his breasts had grown to a definite C cup. He quickly donned a pair of sweatpants and a sweater, but his large middle was barely covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of the commotion, Jason had almost forgotten about Heather. He looked over and saw that she was still asleep on his bed, her naked body turned away from him. He quietly waddled over to her, and caught a look at her own large belly, the same size as Jason's to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason lightly tapped her on the shoulder. \"Hey, Heather, please don't freak out...\" he mumbled. Heather opened her eyes, as they darted right to her belly. She let out an incredibly shrill scream. \"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?\" she yelled, gasping.  \"I don't know, it must have been that Xpect drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason...I...I think we're pregnant...\" she said, placing a hand on her rotund middle. \"That's impossible! I'm a guy, I can't get pregnant!\" he exclaimed. \"Well, we need to go to the hospital!\" Heather said. \"I know. It'll have to wait until after classes. I promised Mr. Freeman that I'd be in class today.\" Jason said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. So after class, we go straight to the hospital, and get things checked out.\" she said.

After filling their trays to the brim with food, the two of them waddled towards an empty table and then proceeded to stuff their faces.  As they did so however, they looked around and saw that all of the students are sporting big bellies of various sizes, although only a few had bellies as big as theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, why does everyone here have big bellies?\" Heather puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but once we're done with classes today, we can go to the hospital and get checked out.  Maybe then, we can get some answers.\" Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey immediately went to their classes after they ate.

After all of the professors were present, she stood up, straightening out her button down shirt that was straining to contain her oversized belly, which was just a bit smaller than Jason's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, staff.  As you may have realized, many of us have been experiencing some...growth in our stomach area over the last few days.  While we aren't sure of the cause of it, our doctors have determined that we have become pregnant.\" she said, as many of the staff members gasped.  \"So we have brought a few ultrasound machines in to have things confirmed.  Out of respect, they will be placed in the room next door, so it will be done privately.\" Dean Charles concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Luddington walked into the room first.  She wore a maternity blouse, though she was the smallest belly-wise in the room.  Considering that she had gone through three pregnancies before, she knew what it felt like.  She sat down as nurse ran the wand over her mid-sized belly.  \"Looks like it's triplets.\" the nurse said.  \"Three more babies?  Oh, bollocks!\" she said, letting her British heritage show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Ella Smith and her husband Elliot, who was the university's French professor, waddled into the room together.  Since there were two ultrasound machines in the room, they had theirs done at the same time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quintuplets for the both of you.  Mr. Smith, you're the first pregnant man we've ever seen.  Congratulations?\" the nurse trailed.  They both looked upset.  Considering they were both fairly young, they weren't remotely ready to start a family this soon, especially with ten new additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Ramona Vazquez walked into the examining room, wearing a shirt that was way to small for her large middle.  \"What is the meaning of this?  I'll have you know that I haven't had sex in twenty years!  There is absolutely no way that I am pregnant!\" she declared.  \"Miss, please, just make this easy for us.\" the nurse pleaded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she said heaving herself up on the table.  After a brief look, the nurse came to a conclusion.  \"Sextuplets, it looks like.\" she said.  \"WHAT?!?\" Ramona screamed.  She absolutely hated kids, and was even more worried about how big she was gonna get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the remaining round-bellied professor's examinations, it was Dean Charles's turn to be examined.  The nurse navigated the wand across her swollen dome.  \"You're having septuplets.  Seven babies, Ms. Charles.\" the nurse said.  Anna said nothing, but shed a tear instead.  She had always wanted to have a large family, but her career had always gotten in the way.  She looked down and began to rub her belly, feeling the faint kicks within.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Right down the hall to the left.\" she said, feeling that Jason would go into labor any minute now, though this was quite a ways off.  The three waddled into the examining room, where a woman who looked to be in her 50s was waiting, a mid-sized belly attached to her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.  I am Dr. Sophia Thomas, I'll be conducting the ultrasounds today.  It seems like there is an odd number, so who wants to go first?\"  she asked.  \"I'll go.\" said Rick, heaving himself up on the table.  Dr. Thomas examined the inside of his stomach, and came to a determination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my.  You're pregnant with twins!  Around four months along.  I thought I heard the other doctors talking about male pregnancy, but I never experienced it with a patient before.\" she said.  \"Oh, man!  My partying days are over!\" he pouted, sliding off of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Heather got on their respective tables, and held hands while they let the doctor work.  \"WHAT?  Surely this isn't possible!\" exclaimed the doctor.  \"What?\" the two big-bellied college students said in unison.  \"I--you're both around four months pregnant...with octuplets...\" the doctor trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\" they exclaimed again.  \"Take a look for yourselves!\" she said, turning the monitors towards them.  Sure enough, eight tiny fetuses were currently taking place inside their wombs.  \"But how is this possible?  Don't you have to be on some sort of fertility drug to have octuplets?\" Heather asked, looking down at her round belly.  \"And how can men get pregnant?\" Jason asked.  \"I have no idea.  I'll have to do some research.  I'm sorry, I need time to think.\" Dr. Thomas said, ushering them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the hospital and stood outside, wondering what to do next.  \"So what do we do now?\" Heather asked, a hand resting on her belly.  \"Well, we're gonna need bigger clothes.

I can't believe that we're actually pregnant!\" Jason shouted as the three of them walked through the mall towards the clothing stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jason.  It's not that bad.\" Heather said as she used one of her hands to rub her big, round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you say, a woman like you can get pregnant. But this... this is impossible!\" Jason exclaimed, putting his hands on his equally large belly for emphasis.  Rick stayed silent throughout the whole thing, shocked at this turn of events.  The three of them split up as they approached the clothing stores, with Heather entering the maternity clothing store, and Jason and Rick heading towards the big and tall men's store.  Sometime later, Jason and Rick left the store wearing sweaters and sweatpants that did a very good job at hiding their pregnant bellies and swollen breasts, even though they were baggy around the sleeves and pants legs.  Heather left the maternity store wearing a long floral-patterned skirt and a green maternity shirt which barely managed to cover her large belly.  Jason blushed as he looked at Heather's pregnant form, but was quickly interrupted by a loud growl from his stomach, a growl which had echoed in Heather's and Rick's stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food court?\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's go.\" Jason sighed in response as the three of them head off to find something to eat.  The three of them ordered food from stands all over the food court and quickly devoured it, Jason and Heather ate a good deal more food than Rick for obvious reasons.  As the three of them sat there with their bellies full, they suddenly two nearby pops, the source of said pops being Jason and Heather's bellies.  Jason and Heather lifted their shirts and they were surprised to see that their belly buttons have now popped into outies.  As soon as they tucked their shirts back down, they saw a familiar woman in front of them walking around in a skirt noticeable shorter than Heather's and a maternity blouse that looks too small to cover her belly which is almost as big as Jason's and Heather's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Dean Charles?  Is that you?\" Jason called out to the woman as he recognized her as the their college Dean.  The Dean answered to her name as she waddled towards the three students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there!  Jason, Heather, and Rick, right?  What are you all doing here?\"  Rebecca asked as she lovingly cradled her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Dean.  Um, you probably figured this out already, but we're... pregnant.  We just came from the hospital for an ultrasound.  Rick here is apparently having twins.  But Heather and I...  We're both having octuplets.\" Jason said with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octuplets!?  So you and Heather are both having one more than me.\" Dean Charles wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how we all got pregnant?\" Rick suddenly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, but the professors and I are working to figure out the cause of these spontaneous pregnancies.  Especially since it appears that college students and faculty aren't the only ones affected.\" Rebecca stated as they all noticed that almost all of the men and women in the mall have rounded bellies of all sizes.  But before anyone can say anything else, they all heard shouting from somewhere in the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on!  Why can't I stop eating!?  I wont be able to fit through my front door at this rate!!!\" The feminine voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that who I think it was?\" Jason wondered as he quickly recognized who the voice could belong to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded like Professor Vasquez.  She found out that she's pregnant with sextuplets, she's not taking it well.  Probably best to avoid her.\" Dean Charles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell us twice.\" Heather replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I have to get going.  See you all back on campus.\" Rebecca smiled and waved goodbye as she waddled out of the food court.  Jason, Heather, and Rick then hefted themselves up as they prepared to leave. </span></div></div>",

As the trio walked back to Jason and Rick's dorm, they saw hundreds of big-bellied students, but none as big as Jason's and Heather's.  \"So...pretty much everyone at the university is pregnant?\" Heather asked, rubbing her large stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason began to reply. \"Pretty much.  Everyone except--\"  \"Mr. White?\" a voice asked.  Jason turned, his belly carrying a load of momentum, and saw that Professor Freeman was standing before him, his mouth agape.  \"Professor Freeman!\" Jason yelled.  \"I--what---are you...pregnant?\" he asked, approaching Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three of us are.  Rick's having twins, and me and Heather are both having...octuplets.\" he said, as he felt a few kicks.  \"But...how?  I've heard a few rumors of male pregnancy going around the campus but...to you...one of my favorite students...is just unbelievable.\" the professor trailed.  \"I wish I knew.  The doctor said we were all four months along.\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll be able to take exams?  That's good, I guess.\" said Professor Freeman.  He bid the pregnant students farewell, and left.  After that, they returned to Jason and Rick's room.  \"So what now?\" Jason asked.  \"I'm actually pretty tired, I think I'm gonna get some sleep.\" Rick said.  \"Yeah, me too.\" replied Heather.  \"So do you want me to walk you back to your dorm?\" Jason asked.  \"Actually, I was hoping that I could stay with you guys.  I mean, these pregnancies aren't normal, and who knows how long it'll be until we give birth?  I...I want to be with you.\" she told Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are only two beds, so how is this going to work?\" Jason asked.  \"I could just share a bed with you.\" replied Heather.  \"I don't know, do you really think it's big enough?  What do you think, Rick?\" he asked, looking to his roommate to find that he was already fast asleep.  \"I guess that answers that.\" Jason said, climbing into bed with Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, or afternoon I guess.\" Jason laughed, their bellies touching.  \"Night.  Hopefully we won't wake up bigger tomorrow...\" Heather said.</span></div></div>",

She was talking to her three children, Brad, Brittney, and Bella.  Brad, 19, and Brittney, 18, were back from college for winter break, while Bella was just 15.  They all had brown hair and eyes, a trait they got from their mother.  Her husband, Brad Sr. was away on a business trip, one that he'd return from in nine days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire opened the door, but arrived to see a black van drive off into the night, quickly leaving suburbia.  She looked down at the doorstep, and saw a six-pack of what looked to be an energy drink.  Claire carefully picked it up, and looked at one of the cans, which was half-blue, half-pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect?  Drink more, Xpect more?  Product of Yaral Industries?  What is this?\" she asked her kids, who veered their heads from staring at the TV.  \"Oh, right!  That's a new energy drink that's been buzzing online.\" said Brad, approaching his mother, and more importantly, the drinks.  \"It's supposed to be the best energy drink on the market right now.  So Brad and I thought we should try it.\" said Brittney.  The children began to pester Claire so they could drink it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!  I don't know anything about this drink!\" Claire yelled.  \"Wait, Brittney and I used out own good money for this, at least try it, and then let us know if we could drink it?\" Brad asked, putting on a smile.  \"Alright.  <b>IF</b> I think it's okay for you to drink, then you guys can have it, but <b>ONLY ONE</b> a day, okay?  Except for you, Bella, you can't touch them.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Why?\" Bella asked, pouting.  \"Because you didn't pay for them.  Any you're underage.\"  Claire responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pulled one of the cans from the six-pack and opened it.  She slowly took a few sips of Xpect, and finished it a minute later.  \"It tastes alright, I guess.\" she said.  A warm, bubbling feeling was felt withing Claire's stomach, and spread out through her whole body.  This feeling was followed by sudden nausea, and she was lucky to make it to the bathroom in time.  After a few minutes of emptying her stomach, she returned to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Mom?\" Brittney asked.  \"No, I think it was those energy drinks.  Made me sick.  I think I'm gonna go to bed,\" Claire said, \"and don't touch those drinks.\"  The kids obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her bedroom, Claire changed into pajamas, and looked into the mirror.  In her mid-40s, age was starting to show, and the pale face that the illness added didn't help.  With a sigh, her head hit the pillow, and immediately fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Claire started towards the door to get Bella up but as she did her stomach jolted again and she clapped a hand over her mouth. Without losing any speed or urgency Claire swerve and barreled forth into her en suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes before Claire went down stairs still in her pajamas, she had lost some of her urgency by now, knowing that Bella was going to be late no matter what she did. She knew what was caused this, it was that drink, no doubt have to complain to someone about. When she entered the kitchen the remaining five cans of Xpect were still on the bench much to her surprise, she was sure that someone would try take one.

So deep in fact, she failed to hear her two older children, Brad and Brittany sneaking out of their rooms downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we really doing this?\" Brittany asked, semi-annoyed. \"Britt, we're not little kids anymore. We ordered those drinks fair and square, with our own money. We can do with them what we like\" Brad said, making his way into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in college now.

She's overprotective to a fault. Remember when she said you couldn't be a cheerleader? Or how about when you couldn't to go Junior Prom because\" Someone would spike the punch and something bad will happen\".\" Brad says, hovering the drink closer to his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I mean, she does want what's best for us..\" Brittany says, popping the top. \"But we are adults\" She finished.<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Brad says, putting the can to his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides.. What's the worst that can happen?\" Brad says, guzzling down the energy drink. \"Oh man, that's bitter.\" He says, smacking his lips. <br>\r\nBrittany followed next, downing her can not as fast as her brother, but faster still. <br>\r\n\"Wow, that IS bitter.\" She said. \"Where did you get this stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some weird joke novelty website. Magic coins, strange amulets, energy drinks, all sorts of weirdo stuff\" Brad says, popping the top of another can and drinking it down. \"You ordered energy drinks from a novellty website?\" Brittany asked, placing a hand on her stomach, feeling a little queazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just thought it would be plain energy drink in a cool can, I collect those. But this was sadly disappointing. \" Brad finished his second can, putting it down, as his stomach let out a low gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad, do you feel weird?\" Brittany asked. \"Not really. My stomach feels a bit warm, but that's because we're drinking this crap at room temperature. \" Brad says, putting the rest of the Xpect energy drink cans in the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm going to throw up!\" Brittany said, covering her mouth with her hand and running off towards the bathroom. <br>\r\n\"Pfft, some peopel don't know how to hold their energy drinks.

And worst of all, she still felt a sick gurgling in her stomach that didn't feel like it was letting up any time soon. Clair put her head back on the pillow and sighed, closing her eyes and lying still. A few deep breaths and Claire tried to relax, focusing on drifting off to sleep. Trying to get her mind off of that bizarre dream where she had an impossibly huge pregnant belly, not to mention the belly her kids both had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no good. Claire couldn't get comfortable, but at least she was close to resting. How much time had passed? 11:36. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Claire groaned, rolling out of bed and stretching out, slipping on some warm sweatpants and a thicker shirt, as well as a robe. There were only a few times in her life that Claire remembered feeling so restless and fraught with insomnia (the only moments that came to mind for her were during her last three pregnancies) and knew what she did back then: talk to Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth Dawson had been the Perkins' family neighbor ever since they moved in together and she had become one of Claire's closest friends. They talked all the time and whenever Claire was having a tough time, Elizabeth always seemed to be able to help her out. After putting on a pair of slippers, Claire creeped out the house and over to Elizabeth's, knocking quietly on the door. The lights were all of and Claire figured her friend had already gone to sleep. Maybe she should have called or texted her first. Just as Claire turned around, the door creaked and opened, Elizabeth's smiling face peeking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't sleep either, Claire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled and shook her head. \"Not quite. Mind if I come in?\" Elizabeth smiled and welcomed her friend inside. They were both roughly the same age. Elizabeth had dark Latin skin and short, straight black hair with dazzling brown eyes. They both sat down at Elizabeth's kitchen table. Just before Claire started to talk to her friend, she saw a familiar package on the countertop. \"Say...isn't that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect Energy Drink?\" Elizabeth said with a smile, rolling her eyes. \"I know. Roy saw it online and wanted to try it and insisted we all do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad too,\" Claire chuckled. \"Nasty stuff, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded. \"I've been throwing up ever since I drank it. Well, I suppose it's slowed down now, but I still feel lousy. Still, I'm managing.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nElizabeth had four children, two sets of twins. Her oldest two, Monica and Christine, were 20 and were tall, gorgeous girls with long flowing hair who spent half the day playing video games and watching movies and the other half jogging and socializing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other pair, Roy and Veronica, were fraternal 18-year-old twins. Roy was planning to go to college in business and was obsessed with weird foods and drinks, sometimes out of a belief that they'd have some big health boost, and other times out of pure curiosity. Veronica, on the other hand, was a complete music nerd who was content to just eat junk and did so with great gusto. Elizabeth warned them both that their metabolism would catch up with them eventually and they'd come to regret their strange eating habits, but for now, both were stunningly attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea why you can't sleep?\" Elizabeth said, putting her hands on the table and smiling compassionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be this nausea, like you said,\" Claire said, Elizabeth's glance not letting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it's not anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth, it's perfectly reasonable to have insomnia <u>not</u> be caused by some emotional distress,\" Claire sighed. \"When I was pregnant, I couldn't sleep either. You didn't think there was some issue back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as I recall, with Brad you were scared about being a first-time mother, with Brittany you were worried about the challenges of raising a girl, and with Bella, you were also going through your own mother's death.\" Elizabeth reached her hand over. \"It's okay, if you want to talk about something else, it's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed again. \"What is this power you have over me...maybe I've been feeling...old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see? Now that's something we can talk about,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"We're the same age. Do you think of me as old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Claire said quietly. \"But you're...look at you. You go out and do exciting things and for heaven's sake Elizabeth: you still look like you're in your 20s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckled and tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \"Even so, I still feel old sometimes Claire. And one day, we're not just going to think we're getting older. We really are going to be old.\" She took Claire's hand in hers. \"And that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just...it's hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's hard,\" Elizabeth said. \"But you're old because you've lived a long life. Is there anything about your life you're not happy about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shook her head. \"No, you're right. I've got three amazing children. Well...maybe I'd wish for a husband who was around more.\" Claire blushed and turned to Elizabeth quickly. \"Sorry, I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Elizabeth said with a small smile. While Elizabeth was pregnant with Roy and Veronica, her husband Charles Dawson divorced her and ran off with his secretary. Elizabeth made enough from her own job, plus the payments Charles made, to support raising four kids, but she hadn't remarried since. \"But, I hope I've made my point. We've had great lives and they're hardly over now. We can both still do all kinds of things. Besides, you wouldn't really want to relive your youth again, would you? Especially the three pregnancies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm glad those are behind me,\" Claire chuckled. \"Well that's not quite true. I miss being pregnant, but I wouldn't want to be pregnant again. Especially at this age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Elizabeth laughed. \"And going off of my last two, if I got pregnant again, I'd end up with two boys who are just as odd as Roy. Maybe even more than two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shuddered with a smile. \"Pregnant with triplets. I can't even imagine it.\" The two shared a laugh and Claire sighed with a smile. \"Well, thank you, Elizabeth. You always make me feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock struck midnight and both groaned softly, feeling their stomachs. \"I feel better too,\" Elizabeth grinned. \"You know...I don't feel nauseous anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Claire said, feeling her belly cautiously. \"Well, I'd better try and get some sleep. We'll talk more tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Elizabeth said, the two getting up and hugging. \"Good night, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Elizabeth,\" Claire said, walking back to her house.</span></div></div>",

She remembered the conversation clearly, even the whole portion about Elizabeth's family also trying Xpect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sometime after leaving, she didn't remember getting back into her safe warm bed and going to sleep. She vaguely remembered another pregnancy related dream, sometime about her family and Elizabeth's family all waddling around complaining about their pregnancies, but it was all a blur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire picked up the phone and smiled, seeing it was her husband, calling from his international business conference overseas. Answering the call, she smiled and perked up a little bit, all the worries washing away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya honey. How you  doing?\" Claire smiled. \"URK!\" Was the answer she heard back from the phone, causing her to hold the phone away from her head as the violent sounds of her husband throwing up came in clearly through the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" Claire asked, starting to get worried about her husband's health. \"Ugh, I'm fine.\" He said, spitting into whatever it was he was throwing up in. \"You know how it is with this multi-day conferences, one person gets sick, and then EVERYONE gets sick. How are you doing honey?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Just feeling a little queasy this morning\" Claire said, which was true. That strange nausea had returned, but not necessarily to the point that she was going to throw up. \"I know that feeling.\" Her husband said on the other end of the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what happened?\" Claire asked. \"Well, I arrived at the convention only to find out that parts of the presentation that our group was suppose to do wasn't finished or something. So me, Tom, Jenny, Anita, Brenda, and Mark decided to pull an all-nighter trying to finish it up before our group goes in a few days. After downing a few cans of some energy drink that Brenda found at some local street vendor around here, we all got really sick, but we powered threw it. That presentation is going to knock the socks off the investors and the board. It's going to be big, really big. I can finally get that raise, and I can work less hours and spend some more time with you and the kids.\" Her husband said, sounding a little sad about how much he was working all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Energy drink?\" Claire asked, wondering if... \"Yeah, something called Xpact or something. It tasted horrible and made everyone sick, but we got it done. Strange thing is though, my chest is killing me and I'm still throwing up, I mean it's night over here!  I'm pretty sure one of the people here are sick or something. You wouldn't believe how many hands I had to shake.\" Her husband said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the good news is, if the presentation goes as well as I think it well, I can be home early. We were scheduled for 9, but I think I can home a day early, six days from now. Dosen't that sound great? I could have an extra day at home.\" Her husband said over the phone, through bites and chews. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you eating something?\" Claire asked. \"Oh yeah, I got room-service. Cheeseburger, fries, chocolate milkshake, chicken wings. God, I feel like a fat pig eating all of this, but I'm starving for some reason. I had such a craving all-day.  I'll probably work it all off during these conferences, running from floor to floor and room to room, but you know what they say: Feed a cold, starve a fever. Mmm\" Her husband said, stuffing more food into his face, unaware that he was eating for three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just don't eat to much. I still you're lovely sexy lankiness\" Claire said, flirting with her husband over the phone. She missed him when he was gone so much. It was much tougher this time, because Claire found herself overflowing with...needs. She had no idea where it was coming from, but it was nice that somewhere deep inside of her, the passion still burned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it when you talk to me like that\" Her husband said through muffled words, his face full of food. <br>\r\n\"Well, I gotta get going. I gotta round up the group and start heading to boring meetings and stuff. I love you very much, and take care of the kids for me. \" Her husband said, burping loudly and hanging up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadness washed over her, like her emotions were on a roller-coaster. Shaking it off, she got up and un-dressed, stopping in shock as she saw what she saw in the mirror. Her breasts, her slightly sagging, older breasts... were huge! Well, huge to her. They were bigger, at least a cup-size and a half bigger. Her nipples were darkening into a deep shade of brown, and when she touched then.. Claire was almost knocked off her feet by such a sensation that hadn't felt since she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes went wide in realization. \"No..\" She said, turning to her side, her hand exploring her still flat-stomach. \"Get it out of your head Claire. You haven't had sex with him in months.\" Claire said, hammering reason into her head, in a situation where reason left town with reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in the shower, she washed every part of her, including her much bigger breasts, and dried off. Changing into a simple blue shirt that was oddly tight around her chest, hugging her every new curve, she puts on her favorite pants (which also seemed to be getting tight in the backside and on the hips), and walked down stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of vomiting greeted her ears. Looking over to the bathroom, she saw her son bowing to the porcelain god. \"Brad, sweetie, is everything okay?\" Claire asked, the sounds of the urking and splurking making her nearly to want to vomit herself. <br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. I'm just a little nauseous this morning, and my chest is killing me. Britney as well. I think it's something going around. The Dawsons were complaining about it yesterday night. I think it's some kind of bug\" Brad said, turning away from the toilet and resting his head against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys still going to the mall today?\" Claire asked, hunger gnawing at her. \"Yeah, I mean I think so. We were going to see a movie and then shop. \"Brad said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just be careful okay?\" Claire asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire left her son and went down to the kitchen for breakfast. Her middle daughter Britney was nowhere to be found, probably still sleeping in, but her daughter Bella as up, texting on her phone and scarfing down cereal. \"Morning Bella\" Claire said with a smile. \"Mmm\" Bella responded back, not taking her eyes off her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire frowned a little bit. Bella was her youngest child, and was quickly falling away from her. She was starting to get interested in all the things that girls her age were into, and most of that involved ignoring her parents. She wasn't a bad kid, quite the opposite. Bella was kind, sweet, smart, well behaved, a straight A student, but half of the time, she was barely seen, going from this social event to that friends house nearly everyday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gave up trying to talk to her youngest, opting instead to fry up some eggs. She had such a craving. She didn't even really like eggs, but an omelet called to her right now. Hell, she hadn't had an omelet since she was... Claire shook that train of thought of the rails of her brain, and went back to frying up a big omelet filled with peppers, vegetables, cheese, meat, the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quickly scarfing down the food with gusto, her phone buzzed with a text message. It was from Elizabeth. KIDS OUT OF THE HOUSE. WANT TO HANG OUT? TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe texted back: YES.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth texted back: SEE YOU SOON. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Britney and Brad came down the stairs..We.. </span></div></div>",

Bella remained silent, her fingers making rhythmic beats on her cell phone screen.  Claire's cell buzzed, as she had recieved a message from Bella.  YES. was the sole reply.  \"Alright, well I'm going over to Elizabeth's for a while, so don't make a fool of yourselves, okay?\" she pleaded.  As her children replied with a groan, she headed over to Elizabeth's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire knocked the front door, and waited for Elizabeth to answer.  Elizabeth opened the door, and appeared to be munching down on a sandwich.  \"Hey, Claire.\" she said in between bites.  \"Hey...whatcha got there?\" Claire asked, gesturing to the sandwich in question.  \"Peanut butter and pickle sandwich.  Got a weird craving for it.  I've been <i>STARVING</i> all day, you?\" she asked, as they entered the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much.  And...I think my boobs have gotten bigger...\"Claire said, somewhat shyly.  \"Me too!\" Elizabeth exclaimed.  As the two were standing there, Claire could tell that Elizabeth's breasts had indeed grown, and she could have sworn that her normally toned tummy had the slightest curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire responded \"You know, it's almost like I'm--\"  \"Pregnant?  Yeah!  But that's just silly, right?  I mean, I've been single for a while and I guess you and Brad haven't...\" Elizabeth trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.  It's probably that crappy energy drink.\" said Claire.  \"Anyways, the video store had an 'everything must go' sale last night, and I ended up buying this movie.  Wanna watch it?\" Elizabeth asked.  \"Sure.  What is it?\" Claire asked.  \"Heads or Tails 2...some straight-to-DVD sequel.  Made by some company called Yaral Industries...\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral Industries?\"  Claire paused, trying to place that name.  \"Wait!  They're the people who made that Xpect drink!\" she said.  \"Oh, they must to a bunch of stuff.  Want some popcorn?\" Elizabeth asked.  \"Sure.\"  Claire responded, as her stomach gave a growl.  \"Actually, make two bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads or Tails 2, not surprisingly, turned out to be a pregnancy movie.  Samantha, a recently divorced teacher in her 50s mysteriously found herself pregnant with twins due to a magical coin.  She fell in love with a much younger teacher at the school,Dylan, who also got pregnant from the coin.  The movie ended with Samantha in Dylan's arms, as the audience learned that Samantha was pregnant again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  A magical pregnancy?  Like that's possible!\" Elizabeth scoffed.  \"Alright, I think I'm gonna head out.  This was great!\" Claire said, getting up from the couch, as Elizabeth followed suit.  \"See ya, Claire!  I'll call you later!\" she said, resting a hand on her belly.  Elizabeth left the house and returned back home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire looked over at the clock. Only noon. She could spend the whole day with Elizabeth but they both had their chores and Claire had already told herself she'd put off shopping until her husband was out of town. He'd been away for a few days already and was coming back early now. Claire couldn't put it off much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off I go,\" Claire said, hand mysteriously glued to her belly, content on rubbing in small circles. It wasn't until she reached for her purse that she noticed the motion. \"Feeling my own bloated gut? What am I doing?\" Claire said, shaking her head and removing her hand, the warmth of her middle lingering on the palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her car, Claire struggled with the seatbelt, her breasts now sore and sensitive. The strap had to be placed just right to cause minimal distress. \"Guess that's one thing I need to add to the shopping list: new bras,\" Claire scoffed. She'd never thought she'd become increasingly endowed in the middle of her 40s. She'd given up on those prospects in high school. <i>Maybe I should schedule a doctor's appointment too</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove, Claire flipped around on the radio. One station had two obnoxious DJs and an overly sexualized female sidekick advertising some sort of bikini contest, which drove Claire to change the channel quickly. The other stations weren't much better. All Claire got was a sea of classic rock that all seemed to have suspiciously similar themes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u266b Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move! \u266b\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u266b Mama...just killed a man... \u266b\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u266b Mama told me not to come! \u266b\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Claire just flipped the radio off, scratching her head nervously. Maybe Elizabeth's little comment about feeling pregnant, plus the movie made Claire see patterns that weren't there. It got her mind focused on pregnancy. And as Claire got older, it was definitely something she was thinking about more. She would never have another chance to feel one of her children grow and move inside of her. Instead, Claire was wondering about when her own daughters would take on the same burden and have their own kids. Well, she wondered about it with Brittany in a slightly more idyllic way. The idea of Bella getting pregnant at 16 was a constant source of fear for Claire and her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, the choice to complete the drive without the radio on created a nice moment for Claire. Left alone to her thoughts, she got to think about her life as a mom and what the future had in store. Now if she could just get rid of this light nausea, she could start on the path to enjoying that new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked in the mall's lot and walked in, surrounded by other bustling shoppers. One of Claire's friends, Susan, was having her baby shower in four days on Saturday and Claire knew the baby stuff she had back home was way too old to pass off to her friends. Claire was surprised by the amount of foot traffic there today, but more than that, there were a lot of wide-stomached people. Men and women. Claire didn't think too much of it. After all, she wasn't in great shape, but she didn't know there were that many overweight or paunchy people in town. She'd always thought the city was pretty attractive on the whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free samples. Free samples here,\" a dull-voiced man and woman parroted in front of one of the mall's larger stores. \"Super Nutrient Health Center Max,\" not to be confused with the smaller chain, \"Super Nutrient Health Center,\" was a store for athletic gear and lots of hokey supplements, powders, that sort of thing. Both of the employees standing in front of the ol' \"SNHCM\" were holding a serving tray with lots of little dixie cups, filled with a strange black liquid. And to Claire's surprise, nearly every passerby was taking a cup and drinking it. None of them seemed too pleased with the result however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire walked by, the woman, a short, college-age girl with long brown hair, a nose ring, and glazed over eyes, reached her arms out slightly. \"Ma'am, free sample? It's a new energy drink, Xpect.\" Like most everyone else in the mall, she had a bit of a bloated look to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect?\" Claire said with a raised eyebrow. \"No thanks, I've had it before. It's...pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's nasty,\" the man, also a college-aged kid with short spiky hair and obnoxious gauge earrings and similarly dead eyes said. \"But the store's selling a lot now so...that's cool, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's whatever,\" the woman said. \"We're not making any more money off of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled politely. \"Well, good luck. I hope other passersby are nice to you.\" As she left, she saw the guy had a rounded stomach too. <i>Geez, you'd think a health store could hire some employees who were actually in shape. Or at least not put them in front of the place</i>, Claire thought, one hand moving to her own belly. <i>But who am I to judge</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this sucks,\" the woman said. \"It sucks that we can't get stoned after work anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's been two days now, ever since the new boss started doing those drug tests more regularly,\" the man said, letting more strangers take samples and contort their faces at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire continued around the mall, eventually finding what she was looking for: Baby Universe, the biggest baby and maternity product store in the state. Walking around inside, Claire was immediately greeted by the smiling clerk, her dark black dress doing little to conceal her own bloating. \"Hello, welcome to Baby Universe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Claire smiled, looking around. \"I'm looking to get my friend something for a baby shower. This will be Baby Number One for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exciting!\" the clerk said, putting her hands together. \"Well, you can't go wrong with a crib.\" In all honesty, a crib seemed like far too big of a gift for a baby shower, but the clerk wanted to move merchandise. The rate of births in the city had dropped off dramatically and if there wasn't a big string of pregnancies soon, she might go out of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crib, huh?\" Claire said, looking around the section, feeling nostalgic as she ran her hands over the bars. \"That's a good idea. I'll pick something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" the clerk grinned, hurrying back to her desk, her new-found weight impeding her speed some and causing her to take some deep breaths. As Claire looked around, she passed by the maternity clothes, specifically the maternity bras. They were bigger than what she was used to and they also looked...soft and gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Claire said, taking one particularly good-looking bra and bringing it to the clerk. \"Does this...feel as good as it looks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk giggled softly. \"We found a company that managed to make maternity underwear that had the whole package: support, comfort, and a touch of sex appeal. Think your friend would want something like this too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed, not wanting to reveal the state of her own increased bosom. \"M-maybe. I'll...look into it.\" Claire snuck back to the bras and picked out a number of pairs, trying them on in secret in the changing room. To her delight and slight surprise, they went well with her new cleavage. She certainly couldn't go around wearing her old bra. It would leave her chest deformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire put the pile of bras on the counter and gave the clerk the order number for the crib she liked the best as well. \"That can be delivered to your house tomorrow,\" the clerk said, typing everything up. \"And here's a coupon, if you ever need another crib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire laughed. \"Thanks, but unless another friend of mine has a baby shower, I don't think I'll be needing a crib any time soon.\"</span></div></div>",

Walking passed the SNHMC, they were stopped by the two bloated workers, or one of them, as the male employee was scarfing down his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free energy drink samples.  Xpect Energy Drink, fills you with life...\"they droned.  The two noticed the three kids, and stopped them.  \"Hey, kids.  Want a free sample?\" said the female employee, a hand on her belly.  \"No, thanks.  We've tried it already.  It sucks.\" said Brad.  \"Wait, I haven't tried it!\" said Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you won't.  Mom said you shouldn't be drinking this stuff, and what Mom says goes.  Got it?\" Britney said strictly.  \"Fine...\" said Bella with a pout.  \"Alright then.\" said the female worker, finally removing her hand from her belly.  The three kids walked away, heading deeper into the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brad, I think that girl used to go to our school!\" said Britney.  \"Oh, yeah...her name was Shirley or something...I always wondered what happened to her...\" he replied.  \"Looks like she got fat--or pregnant.\" Britney responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Perkins kids continued to wander the mall as the time passed.  Britney stopped at Victoria's Secret.  \"Alright, I'm going to get some new bras, okay?\" she asked.  \"I figured.

Brad shut up, shaking his head as Bella laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, Britney returned from the store, and the children headed back to the Perkins home.</span></div></div>",

Her kids were out, and she had a day off from working at The Olive Branch, the local \"fancy\" restaurant, so she had the day to herself.  Elizabeth sat on the couch, surrounded by empty chip bags and other various foods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was watching one of those pregnancy TV shows, the type that followed expectant mothers up until birth.  Elizabeth normally wouldn't be the type to watch reality TV, but she was oddly hypnotized by the growing bellies on screen.  She was interrupted by a beeping noise coming from her oven.  \"Oh!  That must be the pizzas!\" she said with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, pizzas, plural.  Her body was quickly preparing for the growth that she would experience over the next seven days.  And she would grow, a lot.  Elizabeth was going to become the proud mother of newborn octuplets.  Of course, she was completely oblivious to this, even though a slight paunch protruded from her once-flat torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth retrieved the two pizzas from the oven, and chowed down as fast as she could.  Her stomach let out a slight gurgle.  As she had a sudden craving.  She made her way to the fridge and pulled out a carton of ice cream.  Walking back to the pizza, she applied a scoop to each slice.  Normally, she would hate such a combination, but the sweet taste hit the spot.  \"These cravings are so...weird.  I haven't had them like this since I was...pregnant...\" she trailed off.  Elizabeth threw these thoughts out, as it was impossible, since she hadn't had sex in about a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her meal, she put her plates in the dishwasher and returned to her couch.  Elizabeth picked up her phone, wanting to check up on Claire.  After a few rings, Claire picked up.  \"Hello?\" she asked on the other end.  \"Hey, Claire. It's me, Elizabeth.  Do you wanna hang out tomorrow after I get off from work?  Maybe go shopping or something like that?\" Elizabeth asked, staring intently at the TV.  \"Sure.  Sounds like fun.\" Claire responded.  With that, they hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours, Elizabeth continued to watch the pregnancy show.  Drifting into a light nap.  She woke up, and glanced at the clock.  <i>Thirty minutes to midnight, I should get some rest.</i> she thought.  Walking into her bedroom, she removed her clothing to put on her pajamas.  She glanced at her reflection in the mirror.  She noticed her slight paunch, and gave it a poke, noting its tightness.  \"That needs to go away.\" she noted.  Elizabeth then looked at her slightly larger breast.  \"<b>THESE</b>, however, can stay.\" she added, cupping them in her hands.  A wave of pleasure ran over her, and she jolted.  \"Damned things are sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth put on her pajamas, which was basically a t-shirt and sweatpants.  She noticed that a sliver of her belly was showing.  \"Hmph.\" she grunted, laying down in bed.  She drifted off to sleep as soon as she hit the pillow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire got home, putting down her bags of baby supplies for Susan's baby shower and groaning. Her body was so tired and sore and she was simultaneously fraught with terribly strong hunger and a craving for junk food. Whatever fast food could deliver on its name the best, that's what she wanted. Claire dialed up the only burger place she knew would deliver and fell down on the couch, looking around to see if anyone was home, and undid the button on her pants, letting her bloating stomach breathe a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels nice,\" she cooed, switching on the TV and flipping through the channels until she came across the beginnings of a pregnancy show on the \"Health\" channel. It followed a number of pregnant women throughout the last few months of their pre-motherhood, asking them about what it feels like to be pregnant and so on. On top of that, the women were all \"pregnant models,\" so there was plenty of footage of these women in skimpy outfits, showing off their bare belly. Claire blushed and watched along, oddly intrigued by the sights of the smooth, slovenly bellies and the gleeful, gorgeous women they were attached to. All of the women loved being pregnant and took care of their skin to make their roundness shimmer and glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire might have been unnerved by all the mentions and constant reminders of pregnancy from Elizabeth and the rest of the world around her, but it was nice to quietly meditate on pregnancy in the privacy of her home, with these angelic expectant women smiling and bouncing around on TV. Claire had her share of pregnancy with her three children in the past, but occasionally wondered what it would be like to be pregnant again, especially in the past few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Claire didn't know is that she didn't have to wonder what another pregnancy would feel like. Just like her good friend and neighbor Elizabeth, Claire was currently pregnant with eight little Perkins'. \"Little\" would soon be a relative term, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire sighed and started to absent-mindedly stroke her small but very occupied stomach, the door opened and in walked Brad, Britney, and Bella. Claire quickly did her pants up again and turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay to try and relax and veg out, Mom,\" Britney said with a laugh. \"We all do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled and nodded. \"Where were you three all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mall and school, usual stuff,\" Bella said, putting away her bags. \"We ate at the mall too, hope that's okay. You don't look like you made anything for dinner.\" The youngest Richardson child walked toward the couch and at the TV. \"What are you watching?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little late night program,\" Claire said, her blush not going away. \"It's...interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant ladies?\" Bella said with a raised eyebrow as one Swedish model smiled at the camera, one arm covering her exposed breasts as the other cradled her nine-month bare belly, cameras taking pictures all around the naked pregnant model. \"Well, you have fun with that. I don't even want to think about being pregnant one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire chuckled as her daughter walked up the stairs to her own room. As her only child who wasn't around when Claire was pregnant, it made sense that she had a different feeling about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, this is a little weird, Mom,\" Brad said, looking at the TV as he moved toward the stairs. \"If you're not going to change it, I'm just going to go to bed. I'm pretty exhausted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, goodnight sweetie,\" Claire said. Brad got one last eye-full of the TV before he headed to his room. Unlike Bella, who left because she had no interest in pregnancy, Brad left because he had one. A pretty robust interest and attraction to pregnancy and pregnant women, actually. And ordinarily, he'd love to watch something like that, but around his mom and sisters, he'd feel way too awkward. Brad's only solution was the see if someone had been kind enough to put the same broadcast online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney, on the other hand, was just as hypnotized by the show as her mother and joined Claire on the couch. \"For being pregnant, these women look really...really good,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled. \"I know, it's impressive. I know I didn't look like that when I carried any of you. But then again, these women are professionals and probably have personal trainers and tons of make-up.\" The doorbell rang and Claire smiled. \"While I, on the other hand, ordered burgers for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney's mouth started to salivate as she turned toward the door and saw Claire pay the delivery guy and get a few bags of burgers. \"Um, that looks like a lot of food and...I still feel pretty hungry after eating at the mall. Mind if I share the food with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Claire beamed, glad to have more time with her daughter. \"I might have gone overboard with the food anyway.\" The two cracked open the bags and stuffed themselves with gooey grilled meat as the expectant women on the screen did their gentle exercises to stay in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show went on for an hour and a half, following each woman meticulously, letting the audience into every moment of their blissful, pregnant lives, making them feel each inch the women put on to their rounding bellies. As it went on, Claire and Britney found themselves unconsciously nestling together. The show culminated with the women giving birth, agonizing as they pushed out their babies, and when the first cries were heard, Claire felt Britney slowly sobbing against her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Britney nodded, biting her lip. \"It's just so...beautiful. And to think you went through that for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire didn't need Britney to say anymore, taking her daughter up in an embrace, hugging her tightly. \"Of course, Britney. And I'd do it a million times again. You've grown into such a wonderful woman and I'm so proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney nodded and wiped her eyes. \"And you've always been a great mom, even if I don't always tell you.\" The two exchanged one last hug and Britney headed upstairs to get some sleep. As she walked, Britney stroked her own stomach, wondering if this bloated feeling would go away in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire threw away the burger wrappings and locked up and turned off the lights, heading to her room and taking her baby shower things, as well as the  maternity bras she'd bought for herself. She mulled over whether to wear one to sleep, but decided to take a note from last night and sleep in the nude. After all, what if she had another unexpected swelling tomorrow too? A remote possibility, but her initial cup upgrade came as a shock too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire snuggled into her covers and took a deep breath, closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep, the bellies of the pregnant models dancing through her mind as she faded out of consciousness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmm,\" Claire cooed, rolling around in bed, feeling her eight overdue children kicking inside her gargantuan belly. Her body was wrapped in silk cloth that just barely covered the huge, dark nipples of her swollen breasts and the soft opening that was already concealed by a curtain of dark pubic hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kicking again?\" Elizabeth said, turning to Claire as they lay in their gigantic, cushioned bed together. Elizabeth was draped in the same elegant but sparing clothing. Just the slight adjustment of her hip brought her equally enormous belly to crash against Claire's. The two gasped and giggled at the now regular event of their pregnant bulges hitting one another. \"Mine too. We must be synched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always felt intimately connected to you,\" Claire smiled, rubbing Elizabeth's belly slowly. \"And they must be able to sense their brothers and sister in our wombs kicking too. They want to meet one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they want to meet so badly, they could be born already,\" Elizabeth laughed, stroking Claire's belly now. \"But I'm not in any hurry to lose the feeling of them inside me. It's a sensation I never want to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Claire said, her hand gently going under Elizabeth's sash when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" The two looked down from their bed, which was on a set of gleaming marble stairs, as if they were Greek goddesses, to see Monica, Christine, and Britney all looking up at their mothers, hands on their own enormous bellies. All three of them had bellies that far outclassed any \"typical\" pregnancy but were still nothing compared to Claire and Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\" Claire said, recognizing Britney's voice as the one that posed the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have our babies soon. All of them.\" Claire smiled and nodded, gripping Elizabeth's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful, sweetie. You've done it plenty of times before, so you can all help each other out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we'll be as big as you next time?\" Christine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'll get this big some day,\" Elizabeth smiled, rubbing her own belly with one hand, jutting her hips out to accentuate her size. \"Claire and I even hope we'll get more than eight next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica blushed and giggled, rubbing her own belly. \"That just makes me want to get even bigger even faster to catch up with you!\" All three of the daughters winced and held their smiles. \"Hoo, there goes my water. Time to get these babies out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send one of your siblings to get us when you're done. We want to meet our newest grandkids,\" Claire said as the three waddled away, turning back to Elizabeth, the two looking each other over, their smiles deepening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Elizabeth said, running one finger down Claire's entire breast. \"Where. Were. We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nqwha?\" Claire snorted, waking up in her bed, very much alone and very much tired. She blinked, feeling that she was lying in bed. As she moved her body, she noticed something that made her blush. Brightly. Claire's hand was...under her underwear. Reaching inside. Claire pulled her hand back quickly. It was definitely in the realm of possibility to masturbate during a dream, but Claire had had plenty of sex dreams even in her 40s and didn't remember that ever happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she certainly never had a sex dream like <b>that</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I shouldn't tell Elizabeth about this one,\" Claire mumbled, stopping her hand again. As she moved her hand up, Claire saw something else that was out of the norm for her: Claire's stomach had swelled massively again. It was now impossible to disguise the potbelly she'd developed. Claire threw her legs off of the bed and looked down at herself. Looking down was made difficult thanks to her breasts, which grew another cup and a half over the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Claire said, rubbing her wide belly, feeling its tightness. \"That stupid energy drink must be causing bloating and indigestion. Or maybe it's made me constipated and that's why I feel so big. It would explain the barfing.\" She looked at the clock and groaned, annoyed that she woke up a minute before her alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, Claire got into the shower and washed her body, which now had more surface area to clean. As she washed, Claire noticed that, despite the \"full\" feeling, she felt much better compared to yesterday. There was no nausea, much less physical exhaustion, and sleeping without a bra seemed to make her breasts less sore (but not less sensitive). And even if her new belly was caused by indigestion or some kind of GI problem, she definitely still had her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce changed and snug in one of the new bras she bought, Claire joined the rest of her family in the living room. She was surprised and a little annoyed by how comfortable the maternity bra was. It only added to the ridiculous voices in her head that kept repeating, over and over again, \"...pregnant? Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Mom?\" Brad said, eating a spoonful of Cheerios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine. Pretty good, actually, compared to the past few days,\" Claire smiled, putting some bread in the toaster. \"I think those energy drinks you bought were a waste of money, though. Making us nauseous, now I think it's giving me bloating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Brad said, looking down quickly before looking back up at his mother, his ears burning. \"We'll see. I still have lots of energy so it worked in that respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I feel a little funny,\" Britney said. She had on a thick vest, attempting to cover her breast and belly growth. Her behind had plumped and toned out as well, but there wasn't much she could do to conceal that. The same effects were being felt by Claire and Brad too. As they ate, each Richardson over 18 looked at one another curiously, trying to see if the growth they'd noticed in themselves in the morning could be seen in them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella, however, just passed odd looks between her siblings and mother. \"I had a normal night. I feel fine. Just, if anyone's interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Bella. I'm glad to hear that,\" Claire said, getting her toast and loading in another round. Bella didn't say anything, but she couldn't help but notice that this was the third set of toast Claire had eaten in the short span of breakfast. She was eating at an alarming pace. Same with Brad and Britney. Brad was on his second bowl of cereal and he was eating out of a massive salad bowl. Britney was on her fifth piece of fruit. All of them just ate as if it was the most normal thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'd better go,\" Bella said. \"Getting a car pool with a friend today. Grade field trip.\" With that, Bella slung her backpack on and headed out the door, staring at her family, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should leave too,\" Brad said, patting Britney on the back. \"Have a nice day, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us know if you find any foods or drinks that make this weird feeling go away,\" Britney said. \"Who knows, maybe more Xpect is the cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's one cure I won't try,\" Claire laughed. \"Have a good day, kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Mom,\" both said in unison, closing the door behind them as Claire looked down, rubbing her belly curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Claire sighed. \"What do I have to do today?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmm~\" Elizabeth purred as she woke from her sleep, her fingertips brushing up against her exposed lap, causing her to open her eyes and look down. Her face was red hot and she was panting slightly. She'd had the strangest, most intense sex dream she could remember. Elizabeth had had sex dreams of course, even some where she'd woken up to find her hand drifting downstairs, and even some where she was with other women. But she'd never had a sex dream involving Claire before! And she'd certainly never had a sex dream where she was <u>that</u> pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Elizabeth couldn't help but notice that her abdomen had swelled once again over the night. Yesterday she looked a little heavier but now, Elizabeth had a true potbelly developing. Hell, it had already developed. Elizabeth pushed against the bulge, expecting the unpleasant feeling of squishy fat, but instead found it surprisingly firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be bloating from that terrible energy drink,\" Elizabeth sighed, rolling out of bed and stretching. She looked at the clock and groaned. The grogginess, aching, and nausea of yesterday made her forget to set her alarm. Elizabeth normally gave herself enough time to get ready at a pleasant pace, but not today. She slipped out of her underwear and made it to the shower, running soap and hot water all over her engorging body, not knowing that her body would grow even faster over the next six days as her eight unborn children quickly grew up inside her enchanted womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she showered and struggled with her new breasts impeding some of the process, Elizabeth couldn't shake the images or sensations of her dream from her mind. Typically, dreams, even sex dreams, were gone moments after awaking, but not this time. Going with the flow, Elizabeth slowly teased her clitoris as she showered. Frustrated that it was taking too long to get any kind of release, Elizabeth closed her eyes and focused as she stuck her head under the shower's stream to wash the soap and shampoo from her body. Images and faces flashed through her mind until she returned to a massively pregnant, naked Claire, and she came hard, letting out a silent shriek, her mouth filling with the shower's water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off, Elizabeth tried her best to squeeze into her work outfit. The Olive Branch required all servers to wear typical \"proper\" attire: a white, button-up shirt, cleanly pressed black pants, and thin suspenders. Elizabeth found that her new weight gain, in her belly, breasts, and butt, made her outfit a much tighter fit than before. Still, Elizabeth managed to keep it all on and went out to the kitchen, embarrassed by how hungry she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other children seemed to have the same idea. Monica and Christine were eating eggs and sausage with one hand and texting with the other, both seemingly in perfect synch. Roy and Veronica were fighting over a box of cereal, both wanting to fill up their bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one bowl left! Just get another box!\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could do that too,\" Roy replied with equal vigor. \"Besides, you're looking kind of big. I don't think you need to eat more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk,\" Veronica scoffed. \"Eating all that weird junk and drinking those weird energy drinks has finally caught up with you and given you a gross gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough kids,\" Elizabeth said, her usual motherly smile not leaving her face as she entered the room. \"Why don't you both have some fruit or toast? I'll take the cereal, please. I need to leave soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer kids complied as Monica and Christine both put their plates in the dishwasher and headed out the door. \"Out to see friends,\" Christine said. \"We'll be home for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth waved goodbye as she checked her own phone for the time. \"Damn,\" Elizabeth said quietly. \"Roy, Veronica: you can drive yourselves to school, can't you? I've got to get to my shift soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Mom,\" Veronica smiled, biting into a pear. Elizabeth smiled in response as she started to wolf down the bowl of cereal and head out the door, sighing as she left. Being a single mother was tough and as much as she hated it, sometimes she had to trust the kids to get things done themselves. Absent-mindedly, Elizabeth patted her own belly. <i>If I ever had kids again, I'd end up seeing them even less,</i> she thought. <i>Or I'd have to change everything around for them...it would be a challenge, for sure</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth managed to get to work on time, but still got the typical, irritated and smug look from the manager, Carol Phillips. Carol's brother owned the Olive Branch and she'd worked there for years. She was a wiry, sneering woman in her 50s, with her brown hair tied back tight and her hands always together, her fingers taping back and forth evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You decided to show up,\" Carol smiled, looking Elizabeth over. \"What's the matter? Did your clothes shrink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked down at herself, face red. She knew she was just barely fitting into this outfit thanks to Xpect's added pounds, but she didn't like hearing that observation from other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put on a little weight, Mrs. Phillips,\" Elizabeth said, checking in and getting some of her waitressing materials together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can see that. Weight in a few convenient places,\" Carol said, eyes squarely on Elizabeth's chest. \"Angling for another baby daddy, are we? How many will he knock you up with this time? Four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed and hurried to one of the tables as the hostess sat Elizabeth's first customers for the day. One of the reasons Carol treated Elizabeth with such derision was that, in Carol's mind, Elizabeth was nothing but a \"slut\" who got loaded up with kids and now had to work to support them. She never stood up to Carol, fearing being fired, so she had to take it. Elizabeth was particularly nervous today, because she was not wearing a bra. It hurt too much as it constricted her chest, but she could get by in her current attire and she managed to position her suspenders to conceal her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Carol's occasional harping, Elizabeth's day went fairly well. Her belly rubbed against her shirt and her breasts would shake more than usual, but she didn't feel nearly as tired as yesterday and she wasn't nauseous at all. In fact, the smell of the restaurant's food only set off the strange cravings that were developing inside her, making Elizabeth hungrier and hungrier. What Elizabeth did notice is that her increased chest got more sultry looks from customers, which she was forced to respond with her own smiles. At one table with mid-20s men as her customers, one of her buttons actually popped open, showing off some of her cleavage. The guys obviously noticed and Elizabeth did her usual little grin, hoping she might at least get a bigger tip out of it. She was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you,\" Carol eventually said, shaking her head as Elizabeth filled out a customer's order. \"You look so big now, you might already be pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol, please,\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm trying to focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. You've got more of a belly, your hair is a little shinier, and unless you spent your child support on plastic surgery, your breasts have grown too. Another pair of bastards inside your tummy, imagine it. I never knew you when you were pregnant with the first four. I can't imagine it makes you any better at your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol!\" Joann, the hostess said, putting her hands on her hips. \"Now that is enough! Elizabeth's a nice lady and you shouldn't talk to her like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol scoffed and went into the back of the restaurant. Joann turned around and smiled. \"Sorry about that, hon. Sometimes you need to just stand up to her. Well, maybe it helps because I'm the one who got us our big wine contracts,\" she added with a wink. Joann was much younger than Elizabeth, but her southern upbringing made her call nearly anyone she liked \"hon.\" She was a short woman with wavy, fake blond hair and big rosy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Joann,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you really <u>are</u> pregnant, you'll be in good company,\" Joann smiled, moving her hands to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Joann! Congratulations!\" Elizabeth said, her hands together in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first I thought it was just this gross energy drink they had at the mall, but I took the pee test this morning and...I'm gonna be a momma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth and Joann shared a quick hug before Carol came back to the front, looking at them both skeptically as they bit their lips trying not to smile or giggle. \"Elizabeth...you've worked a long enough shift. You're cut for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Elizabeth said, signing out on the computer and collecting her tips for the day. Working for six hours straight still managed to make Elizabeth sore, even if it wasn't a side-effect of the nausea this time. As she stretched out, Elizabeth checked her phone, seeing a message from Claire asking if she wanted to go shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Elizabeth said to herself. \"I'm going to need some better fitting clothes...especially some new bras...I wonder if I should tell Claire about my dream...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire sighed as she stood by the fountain by the mall's entrance. She knew work sometimes kept Elizabeth long but that knowledge didn't help her feel any less impatient. Bending back and stretching her hips helped Claire feel a little less sore, but not much. Her feet still felt like they were restrained by her shoes, like her feet and ankles had swollen or something. And the rest of her didn't feel much better. Getting a new bra certainly made her breasts feel better, but their increasing size created problems for her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the growing in her belly hadn't stopped. Every now and then, Claire had to stop herself as her hand rubbed over the bulge, which was impossible to hide now. Anyone who walked by and saw her could see that she was a woman in her 40s, putting on weight with age. Claire sighed and patted her bump. It had to happen sometime. Can't be the hip Mom in her 20s forever. At least it didn't seem to spread to her thighs and sides yet, although her ass seemed to have gotten a dose of whatever her belly and breasts had. It wouldn't be so bad if her husband was there to enjoy her new body, but otherwise it was just extra weight that got in the way and got her wayward looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's sad sighs turned to a smile when Elizabeth's car pulled into the mall parking lot, looking for a spot. As soon as Claire got her kids out of the house, she texted Elizabeth about meeting up at the mall. There was an unspoken message that it was to get some new clothes, as Claire suspected the same unfortunate (and very specifically targeted) weight gain was affecting Elizabeth too. Just a hunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth walked over to Claire as quickly as she could, waving and smiling. Claire waved back, surprised when she started to blush softly. Elizabeth looked...well, she always looked beautiful, but it was different this time. She was truly gorgeous and Claire felt feelings well up inside her that she didn't know were there before. A flash of her last dream came into Claire's mind and her ears really started to burn, but tried to clear her head. Of course, it didn't help that Elizabeth's work outfit looked very mature and sexy on her and Elizabeth's suspenders only accentuated her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Claire,\" Elizabeth said, moving in for a hug as she got close to Claire. Claire reciprocated with an eagerness neither was expecting. As Claire's hand reached Elizabeth's back, Elizabeth bit her lip to prevent letting out a little squeak. She didn't get an undershirt on because of her problems with \"size changes\" and Claire's hand on her skin, even if it was through her thin work shirt, was surprising electric. Elizabeth had her dream, the same as Claire's, in her mind and tried not to rub her knees and thighs together as they broke the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we could finally get together like this,\" Claire said, running her hand through her hair. \"We have little talks every now and then, but it's been so long since we had a day to ourselves like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly a day to ourselves,\" Elizabeth chuckled. \"Work was rough and I'm sure one of my kids will call at some point, hollering about some sort of dilemma.\" She smiled and sighed. \"They're great kids but sometimes they lose their heads when I'm not around. I don't know how Roy and Veronica can fight so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of mine get along pretty well,\" Claire said as the two friends entered the mall. \"But today isn't about them! Let's just talk and enjoy ourselves. How are things going for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth shrugged. \"Work is always awful but I make enough money to support the family and have time for my own hobbies. I'm going to start going to a book club tomorrow. It's supposed to just be for 'classy' women so hopefully it's not too aggravating,\" she added with an eyeroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you class up any event,\" Claire laughed. \"Mind if I...tag along? I've been a bit bored lately.\" They passed by the mall's health store, where two dead-eyed employees, a guy and a girl, held out a tray of some sports drink, both looking a little too heavy to work at a health and fitness store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled. \"Still thinking about empty nesting?\" Claire was about to open her mouth but Elizabeth stopped her. \"Hey, we don't have to talk about that. What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed. \"Nothing...really, truly nothing. I'm just a boring, aging housewife and I hate it.\" She turned to her friend. \"You've always been so inspirational. Working, bettering yourself, taking care of more kids than me, staying fabulous the entire time.\" Elizabeth chuckled and tossed her hair as Claire kept going. \"I mean it! How...how do you keep it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of marijuana,\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...really?\" Claire said in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Claire,\" Elizabeth laughed while rolling her eyes. \"I don't know, I just...do it? I decided that this is the type of person I want to be. Now come on, you have plenty of skills and talents and you have plenty of personality. You can find something to do. I'll even help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always help me,\" Claire said sheepishly. As they neared the bigger clothing retailer, Elizabeth fidgeted with her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, well if you want to repay the favor, you can tell me how you keep from getting your chest so uncomfortable. We're at about the same cup size now, it looks like,\" Elizabeth said. Claire turned red and opened her mouth, not selecting any words to say yet. \"Don't worry, I...noticed that we're both growing somehow. Must be that stupid Xpect energy drink. So, what's your secret? What bra are you using?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly?\" Claire said. \"It's a maternity bra. And it's amazing. It's soft, it fits, it wasn't as expensive as some of the other custom bras I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's get me some,\" Elizabeth said, looking at the directory and hurrying off with Claire. \"I don't want the girls to get deformed by stuffing them into underwear that doesn't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire went after her newfound crush, panting to catch her breath when they made it to Baby Universe. \"I've...been...getting tired more...lately,\" Claire said, hands on her knees. \"Weight gain...I guess...um, Elizabeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Elizabeth said, panting softly as Claire pointed to her chest. The hurried walk over moved Elizabeth's suspenders, which were the only thing covering up her nipples, given how thin her shirt was and how dark her areolas had gotten. Elizabeth blushed and smiled softly as she moved her straps back in place. \"Now you know how I'm getting by without a bra. C'mon, let's shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire followed her friend, not realizing how Elizabeth's head was swimming now. Claire had practically seen her naked breasts! What did she think about them? Is she disgusted now? Would she be as open to the ridiculous ideas Elizabeth's dream had helped cook up? She yelped a little when Claire tapped her on the shoulder, handing her a bra. \"Here, this is what I'm using. See how it feels on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded and went to the change room, finding this and many other bras she tried on be exceedingly comfortable. \"I feel a little weird wearing clothes meant for pregnant women but...it just feels so good,\" Elizabeth giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Claire said. \"It feels like some kind of strange dress-up, especially given...well, I told you how I feel about my kids moving on.\" Elizabeth smiled and nodding, saying nothing, as Claire looked at some of the other outfits. \"You know, these are pretty good outfits for maternity clothing. And these prices are better than what you'd see for designer clothes...and these would probably fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, are you proposing what I think you're proposing?\" Elizabeth said with a raised eyebrow. \"Look, I know we've both put on weight, but...maternity clothes?\" Elizabeth looked down at her own belly and sighed. \"Then again, we do look like we're starting to get pregnant anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded. \"And, to be honest, I had a dream last night that we were...pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed and smiled. \"I had a similar dream too,\" she said, taking one dress off the rack and holding it against herself. \"Anything else...happen in the dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not that I can remember,\" Claire lied, picking out some outfits too. \"So, we're buying maternity clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckled. \"I guess we are.\" She patted her growing bulge. \"Something to look good in for the little ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire rolled her eyes. \"Don't even joke. The store owner will think we're really pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Britney groaned with boredom in class as the teacher went on and on at the front of the classroom. Health class was supposed to be the \"fun\" class where the teacher blushes as he or she explains how to put on a condom or shows videos from Discovery Health of pregnant women waddling around. But no, this oh-so-stuffy high school had to teach real health. Bones, muscles, diseases, protein. She might as well add another science lab to her schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these two, the radius and the...anyone? Anyone? Mr. Dawson?\" Mr. Franklin, the school's gym teacher and Britney's health teacher, asked, turning to the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took a deep sigh. \"And the ulna, Mr. Franklin.\" Veronica, on the other side of the classroom, rolled her eyes. Of course her health-nut brother knew the answer. He only knew weird, pointless stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, the radius and the ulna, work together to keep the arm upright but light,\" Mr. Franklin said, turning back to the diagram of the human body. Britney rested her head in her hands and couldn't help but notice that her teacher was getting a bit full around the waist. Aren't gym teachers supposed to be fit? \"Compare that to the femur, which is sturdier and stronger, but heavier.\" His voice trailed off in Britney's mind as she yawned, scratching her stomach absent-mindedly, forgetting about the increase in size there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid Brad</i>, she thought to herself. He'd acted like they would hang out while he was home from college and help her cut class, but no, he still dropped her off at this boring high school and promised they would go to the mall and all other parts of town afterward. Brad was probably going to the mall and trying to pick up girls while Britney sat here, stewing in her senioritis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't any more interesting for Roy and Veronica. Roy knew all of this health stuff when he shopped for curry at the Asian market or uncommon meats at the Italian bistro. He wanted as much of a buffet of nutrients as he did flavors. Veronica, on the other hand, was happy to eat whatever with the knowledge that she would still look like a bombshell and couldn't be more bored by Mr. Franklin's droning. Monica and Christine were probably playing some post-5k Dead Souls at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Franklin?\" Kat, one of their classmates, said when the fascinating bone lecture hit a lull. \"When are we going to have some real sex education in this class? This school beats us over the head with these vapid 'avoid teen pregnancy' messages to shame us and scare us, but why is the only health class we get totally devoid of comprehensive methods of prevention? Not just pregnancy too. Sexually transmitted infections and a general improvement in students' understanding of their own sexuality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Franklin let out a long sigh. \"Well Kat...it's just not in the lesson plan. Now, if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat shook her head and stood up slightly. She wasn't very tall but had a very definitive way of dressing in the most flamboyant clothes Goodwill had to offer and her long black hair had spots of blue dying at the tips. Kat adjusted her glasses before continuing. \"Look, teen pregnancy and STIs are real problems and it's the school's duty to teach these kinds of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the syllabus on his desk, hoping a lot of the class wouldn't join in on Kat's side. She was quiet most of the time, but when she got passionate, she had a charisma far beyond her years. \"Alright, here's what I can do for now: I can move the pregnancy part of class up a few days and give some time to methods of prevention. But the school cannot know about this or we'll have the PTA on my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat nodded and sat down, smoothing her black wool dress out to try and conceal her growing belly. \"That's fine. I can use the class to present a better argument to the school board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney watched the whole interaction with a little smile, glad to have something actually happen in class. And some sex ed wouldn't be so bad. It would at least make school more like the high school comedies from the 90s she loved to watch. Veronica had fallen asleep on her desk and Roy was giving his left bicep a tentative touch, wondering if it felt larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the bell rang and the class spilled out. \"Don't forget: we have a test on the skeletal system tomorrow, so study up,\" Mr. Franklin said, no one really paying attention. \"Ah, whatever. When this year is up, I can go back to coaching and not have to do these obnoxious health classes ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney tightened her grip on her backpack as she walked to her locker, past recycling bins full of empty Xpect cans. The drink seemed to have taken off around here. The intercom played a message from the principal, telling students to remember to wash their hands, as some sort of \"stomach flu\" was going around that made students and teachers vomit and included days for make-up tests for everyone who was out due to nausea. As she opened her locker, Roy and Veronica walked over. \"Hey, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad's got a car, right?\" Veronica said. \"Can he take us with the mall later today? We really need to go shopping today. He can just drop us off. There's a bus there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, he's supposed to pick me up right now to go there. You come along with us, it's fine,\" Britney said, looking between her twin neighbors. \"What do you need to buy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Monica and Christine's birthday soon and Mom gets pissed when we don't get them anything,\" Roy said. \"Which is...most of the time. It's bullshit because I got them both great presents last year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Authentic chai' doesn't count as a good gift if they don't want it,\" Veronica scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's delicious, it's good for you, and it was expensive!\" Roy said as Britney started to wave her hands to calm them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, that's fine, just curious. Here, just follow me and we can go to the mall,\" she said, getting out her phone to text Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;here yet&gt; Brad read as he sat in his car outside the high school. He sent an affirmative text and looked out his window, looking at the students of his former high school. They were all a little heftier than he remembered kids being when he went there, but lately, he wasn't one to talk. One girl in a particularly tight \"Seniors!\" shirt walked by. She was gorgeous all over, but the tightness of the shirt accentuated her potbelly. <i>Maybe she's pregnant</i>, Brad thought, his face turning red as he tried to suppress his sudden outpouring of arousal. Brad had managed to hide his pregnancy fetish from his family and friends for decades and once he graduated and had his own place, he would be truly home free. <i>Just keep it together until then</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Britney, Roy, and Veronica walked over and opened the doors. \"They're coming with us to the mall,\" Britney said. \"That's fine, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Brad shrugged, driving slowly out of the parking lot. As he did, he passed by a student, obviously a freshman, about to crack open an Xpect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that,\" Veronica said out the window. \"It's gross and it just makes you want to puke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student shrugged and threw it into her bag and got into her parent's car. \"Want a free drink, Mom?\" she said as the Richardson/Dawson car headed for the mall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire and Elizabeth walked out of the mall together, leaving from a different set of doors than their kids, each with two bags of maternity clothes in each hand. As they looked around the parking lot, Elizabeth spied a handsome young guy giving them nervous glances. Elizabeth grinned and took a few steps toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-loo~,\" Elizabeth purred with a little wave. \"Would you mind helping us with our bags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the guy said, hurrying over and taking both of Elizabeth's bags. \"Ma'am, can I take yours too?\" He said, motioning for Claire's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire started to say no but Elizabeth cut her off. \"Yes please. It's nice to have someone treat two pregnant women so nicely,\" she said, giving him a loving look and rubbing her hands over her modest bulge. The guy blushed brightly as he took Claire's bags and walked out into the parking lot. \"That's it, just walk ahead and I'll tell you when you get to our cars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth!\" Claire whispered angrily. \"What are you doing? Besides, why are you telling people we're pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon Claire, have some fun,\" Elizabeth whispered back. \"If we've got these pregnant-looking bloating bulges, we might as well get something out of it. People treat pregnant women better and some people even find it <u>sexy</u>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed. \"Don't be silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I've always found pregnancy pretty hot, but I think I'm an outlier,\" Elizabeth chuckled, waving her hand and calling out to the guy, her voice raising. \"Yoo-hoo! This is my friend's car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" the guy said, obviously straining to carry the eight bags of maternity clothes. \"Which ones were yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that,\" Claire said, taking four of the bags and opening the back of her car. \"My friend and I can sort that out when we get home. You've done enough already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice, this one,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"A natural mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shot Elizabeth a nasty look as Elizabeth walked with the helpful boy to her own car, prancing and smiling. \"Elizabeth, sometimes you can be so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Elizabeth got her own car loaded up and tipped the guy $3 and a peck on the cheek, she sat back in her car and texted Claire. &lt;so what now?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire adjusted her own seat and found herself adjusting her shirt to accommodate her belly and breasts. Getting a new bra helped a lot but what Claire really needed was a fitting outfit. &lt;home to try on these clothes&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth laughed to herself and turned on her car, rubbing her sensitive nipples quickly, her suspender straps from work still causing discomfort. She looked around to make sure no one was watching first though. Flirting with some random cute teenager to get her bags carried was one thing, but a guy rubbing one out in his car while she felt her breasts was another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Elizabeth's house, they both laid their spoils from the mall over Elizabeth's big bed, a left-over from her married days. \"So, what belongs to who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These bras are yours,\" Claire said, taking a fistful and handing them to her friend. \"Maybe you should try them on sooner rather than later. What you're doing to improvise can't be comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Elizabeth said, removing the straps and massaging her chest. \"Are you going to...turn around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed. \"I-I guess so. If you want.\" Claire turned around, their dreams still weighing heavily on both of their minds. Elizabeth unbuttoned her shirt and slipped one of the maternity bras on, closing it up and feeling it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about that? Fits like a glove,\" Elizabeth said. Claire turned around and saw her very attractive friend shirtless with a bra on to hold her abundant bosom, which only intensified Claire's flustered feelings. \"...you don't have to just stare if you don't like it,\" Elizabeth said quietly, holding her hands over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it looks great!\" Claire said nervously. \"I just, um, didn't realize your belly was just as big as mine. You looked smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Elizabeth said, looking down at her bulge. \"Yeah. Well, you don't look too big either. You look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please,\" Claire said, rolling her eyes. \"Well, let's try on these clothes, okay? Hopefully they let us return them. I don't know how you talked me into buying maternity clothes. I guess there's always my friend's baby shower so I could give them away there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me these will fit more than we want,\" Elizabeth laughed, taking a blouse and slipping it on, putting her hand over her bloated belly to see if it felt any roomier. \"Well, obviously there's some give,\" she said, turning to Claire, \"but I think it's a winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claire said, looking at herself in the mirror, astonished at how good she looked in maternity clothes when she wasn't pregnant. Unless... \"No, I'm not pregnant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire?\" Elizabeth said cautiously, walking over to her friend. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Claire said, her hand in her head, a few tears starting to spread. \"Sorry, mood swing or something. I guess getting older and having my kids growing up and my husband being gone. All together it's...I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth gulped, not sure if she should offer Claire a hug or not. But as she saw her friend rubbing her red, puffy eyes, she decided she could get away with it and embraced Claire, their big breasts pressing together erotically, which didn't make Elizabeth feel any better about her decision. \"Hey, hey, you're going to be fine.\" She looked into Claire's eyes. \"We're both going through this so we can rely on one another, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Claire sniffed, rubbing her eyes. \"Sorry, weird hormones I guess. And you're right, we can work on this together. But I wish I had the same strength you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do,\" Elizabeth smiled, her smile slowly fading. \"I know that Brad is gone from home a lot, so that gives you a lot of excuses to come and chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Claire said, starting to smile. \"Ugh, can you imagine what he'd say if he got home and found out that I was pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth and Claire laughed a little before Elizabeth turned her friend so they could both look in the mirror. \"He'd still have to count his lucky stars he ended up with a woman as great as you. And I'm happy to call you a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha-\" Claire started to say before Elizabeth planted a kiss on her cheek. \"...Elizabeth...what was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to get her whole sentence out when the sound of the front door closing resounded through the house. Elizabeth hurried out the door, finding a convenient excuse to not have to explain the stupid thing her own hormones made her do. \"Monica, Christine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom,\" they panted in unison. Elizabeth went down the stairs and saw them both in running tops and tight shorts, the whole outfit revealing their own rounding bellies. \"Just finished a 5K,\" Christine said, walking slowly toward the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a 5K?\" Elizabeth said with a raised eyebrow. \"You both seem a little too...out of breath for that.\" Monica and Christine were pretty avid athletes, but they were both bright red and dripping with sweat, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This extra weight makes things harder,\" Monica said, patting her stomach. \"Thanks to Roy's dumb drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra weight on the lungs too,\" Christine said, prodding her chest. \"Our sports bras don't really fit anymore either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might have something that'll fit better,\" Elizabeth said, walking to the fridge and handing her daughters water bottles. \"For now, just relax until we go to the doctor and find out how that Xpect garbage affected us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower then Dark Souls?\" Monica shrugged to Christine as they headed to their ground-level room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire made it downstairs and watched her friend's oldest twins walk away. \"So, want to finish sorting out these clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but we need to make plans for the rest of the day,\" Elizabeth said, trying to think of some activity to get her mind off of her dream of Claire. \"How about one of those 70s style clubs in the city. It lets us eat but also gives us a good chance to let handsome guys check us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire chuckled. \"Well that doesn't sound so bad. It might make me feel younger.\" Claire also thought it would give Elizabeth a chance to change into a more...attractive outfit but tried to block out that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Let's find the perfect ensemble and head out,\" Elizabeth smiled, her cravings already forcing her to imagine the meal she and Claire would be sharing tonight</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Elizabeth, I don't know about these,\" Claire blushed, looking down at her tight red dress. \"Couldn't we have tried on our maternity dresses instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, these are better for tonight,\" Elizabeth grinned, turning and looking at herself in the mirror next to Claire, sporting a black ensemble that showed off hints of her new, ample cleavage. \"And we don't really need maternity dresses. Those are just to make us more comfortable down the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expecting us to start growing bellies?\" Claire chuckled, feeling her own swollen middle nervously. \"Might I remind you: we are not actually pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm not,\" Elizabeth said, winking at Claire. \"Not to pry into your private life with your husband.\" She walked over to Claire, tucking her tag back under her shoulder straps. \"But look: we both look great in these dresses, don't we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked down, holding back a shudder as Elizabeth let her touch linger on Claire's bare shoulders longer than she expected. \"I-I guess so. You look good in yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth withdrew her hand, grinning bashfully. \"Thank you, Claire. I suppose we should go, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded, biting her lip as she followed her friend down the stairs. As they got ready to leave, Christine and Monica were slumped on the couch in tank tops, playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, Claire and I are going out to dinner tonight, so you and your brother and sister and in charge of dinner yourselves. Want me to leave money for pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one?\" Christine asked, not keeping her eyes off the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it would be one per person,\" Elizabeth said, reaching into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Monica said. \"We've got a huge appetite. We'll need more than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth wanted to complain, but with her own monstrous hunger, there wasn't much she could say. \"Why don't I just leave my credit card and you can order it online? Don't get anything else. I'll check with the bank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom,\" Christine and Monica said in unison sarcastically, eyes still glued to the Halo 4 battlefield they were traversing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Elizabeth headed out the door to the car, Claire wrapping her arm around Elizabeth's. \"Guess I'm treating, huh?\" she smiled. Elizabeth beamed back, her breasts brushing against her friend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, but if we're lucky, maybe we can get some guys to pitch in to our evening,\" Elizabeth replied. Although, as much as she tried to fantasize about guys flirting with her at the club, all she could think about the Claire from her dreams seducing her at the table, leaning on the club piano as she sang a Spanish love song, one hand on her enormous belly, the other on Elizabeth's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth?\" Claire said, snapping Elizabeth back into the moment. \"Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth saw that she was sitting behind the car's wheel. \"Yeah, yeah, just hungry and dazed,\" she giggled, turning the car on and heading for the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio was tuned to the local rap station, thanks to Roy no doubt. Elizabeth turned it off and looked around the street as she drove, but soon, a lull of awkwardness drifted over the car. Claire and Elizabeth couldn't stop thinking about the dream they shared and how it made them feel. They both reached for the radio to find something to stop the silence, accidentally touching hands and retracting them immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Claire mumbled. Elizabeth was about the say the same, instead just getting a sympathetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. We just had the same idea,\" Elizabeth said, switching the radio back to rap as she pulled in front of the club. Everyone walking in turned their head as two middle-aged women in tight dresses walked out, hip-hop playing as Elizabeth shook out her long black hair and strolled in. Claire blushed and hung her head a bit as she saw all of the eyes on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're all looking at Elizabeth</i>, Claire thought. <i>She's so beautiful and I'm just...tagging along</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair entered the club, which was exactly as Elizabeth described it: dark brown carpet, a nice long bar in the center, intimate tables all around. It looked exactly like the kinds of restaurants and nightclubs Claire and Elizabeth saw when they were small children. But the 70s were a long time ago and their age proved it. Still, whether it was being here or the \"affects\" of the Xpect, neither felt old or out of place, even amidst all the young men and women in attendance. They felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found a stand-up table, not too far from the bandstand, and relaxed, eyeing the people gathered. A waiter in a old-style suit came up to them, asking for orders. It turned out that the menu here was not nearly as extravagant as the interior, so they settled with a plate of boneless chicken wings for now. Without having to say anything, Claire and Elizabeth both knew that they'd both need a lot more to eat that that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there on, they listened to the light jazz band and eyed people who looked attractive, which mostly led to Claire and Elizabeth laughing at one another. Elizabeth chewed on the last bite of their second plate of wings, turning to Claire. \"Feeling good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is fun,\" Claire smiled. \"It's nice to laugh and goof off a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to goof off. You look great. You could pick up any guy here,\" Elizabeth said. \"It's not cheating to do a little playful flirting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire rolled her eyes. She'd suggest that Elizabeth try to do some flirting, but she figured that as good as her friend looked, the prank might be too successful. As she turned around, a guy who looked to be in his mid-30s walked by. \"Hey handsome,\" Claire smiled, bending down to try and utilize her new chest. \"Want to buy me another round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy turned from Claire to her plate to her budging belly. \"Looks like you've had enough already,\" he smirked, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey asshole!\" Elizabeth said, kicking him hard in the back of the leg. He fell, bending his knees before turning around angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fat bitch!\" he said, as the waiter came up and put his hand on the man's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem here?\" the waiter said, looking between them. Elizabeth gave the guy a mocking look, pursing her lips and raising one eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no problem,\" the guy said, relaxing his shoulders and storming away. The waiter nodded and left too, leaving Elizabeth and Claire to turn back to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that went about as well as I thought,\" Claire sighed with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let him get to you. He's just a jerk. You look great,\" Elizabeth said, reaching a hand over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Claire said with a little smile that vanished quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Elizabeth said, moving over a few steps. \"Honestly.\" She gave her friend and neighbor a quick peck on the cheek and returned to her side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked up slowly, her blushing now far more obvious. \"Now we're really going to get lots of looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth giggled, covering her lips as she envisioned the kind of intimate relationship the more lewd patrons might be imagining her and Claire sharing. They weren't images Elizabeth was particularly bothered by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just leave and get some burgers,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"No one will gawk at us there. Although we are a bit over-dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Claire said, following her friend out, hesitating before giving her a kiss on the cheek too. Elizabeth looked back at Claire with a shocked, smiling face as Claire bit her lip. \"To keep them guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really starting to open up tonight,\" Elizabeth laughed. \"You're better at teasing than you think.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone seemed impatient and complained constantly, some stroking their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to have something now,\" the woman in front of them complained to the guy standing next to her, running her hands against her puffy midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we just ate,\" the guy with her replied in a hushed voice. \"You've been having these weird cravings ever since you took that drink from the mall health store. It even made you throw up. I think you've got some sort of stomach bug or weird nutrition imbalance from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I need to eat some triple cheeseburgers to balance things out again,\" she replied as they made it to the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it,\" Claire said, looking up at the \"menu\" on plastic behind fluorescent lights above the counter, \"but I feel like eating a whole second dinner...I'd look pretty silly doing it in this dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll do it with you so you don't feel as silly,\" Elizabeth smiled, feeling gurgling hunger inside her own stomach. \"And don't worry. There's nothing weird about us classing this place up with our hot new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next,\" the cashier said in a monotone. Claire and Elizabeth approached her and each bit their lips, embarrassed by the huge amount of food they were about to order. Then again, looking around the place, they weren't the only ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ordered, the two bored burn-outs who handed out Xpect samples in front of the mall's health store walked in, standing behind Claire and Elizabeth. \"This is as bad as having munchies,\" the girl in the pair, Kenna, complained, rubbing her belly, which had gotten even bigger since Claire last passed her by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, after working in a store with all of those gross drinks and supplements, I think my body just remembered how good burgers taste,\" the boy, Ethan, said, scratching the side of his face. Before, he and Kenna had moderate pimples and greasy hair, but lately their skin and hair was looking much better. The dull look in their eyes hadn't gone away yet. \"You'd think working at a health store would put us in better health, though,\" Ethan said, prodding his own growing middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels kind of tight,\" Kenna said, her hands never leaving her belly. \"Like it's not fat. But I dunno, <i>Barbara</i> eats that shit all the time and she's getting chunky just like us.\" Barbara, who Kenna was sure to say with derision, was their tough, near-militant boss at Super Nutrient Health Center Max. She and Carol, Elizabeth's boss, could exchange tips. But unlike Carol, Barbara was a young, attractive, and athletic woman, almost always wearing grey spandex over her torso to show off her tight abs and full breasts. Even as her belly was beginning to grow after trying some of the store's supply of Xpect, she kept her outfit the way it had always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Elizabeth sat down with their heaving trays of burgers and fries, eating with gusto. Elizabeth had drops of sauce falls between her exposed cleavage, which Claire just looked with a stunned gaze, unsure of whether to tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something down there?\" Elizabeth said, smiling with a mouthful of sandwich. Claire blushed, not realizing just how obvious it was where she was...staring. \"I can't exactly see much past them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-ketchup,\" Claire said, taking a napkin and moving it toward her friend. \"May I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do,\" Elizabeth replied, the hairs on the back of her neck standing up with anticipation as Claire reached out to touch her chest. Sure, there was a napkin in between, but flashes of last night's dream ran through both of their minds. \"I-I think you got it,\" Elizabeth said after a while, feeling her ears turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Claire said, retreating and starting to finish her meal in silence. The two looked around the rest of the place and saw lots of bulging bellies, though none like theirs. All of the women also seemed very...well endowed. \"Well, I think I need to be getting back home. Brad and Britney probably burned the house down trying to make a pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth laughed, covering her face. \"C'mon, your kids are great. I need to make sure Roy didn't, oh I don't know, try and cook poison puffer fish, or make sure Veronica didn't just eat potato chips for dinner. Or see if Christine and Monica actually ate dinner or just sat on the couch playing video games all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you do it with four kids,\" Claire said, standing up. \"Three is a struggle for me and I have their father's help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know,\" Elizabeth giggled, patting Claire's bloated belly. \"Perkins Baby #4 might still be in the works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh hush,\" Claire blushed, trying to stifle an exclamation. She didn't realize how sensitive her belly felt now. They left the burger place, passing Kenna and Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep getting texts from Joey now,\" Kenna scoffed, putting her phone now. \"Why is he trying to ask me out suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, your tits have been looking pretty hot lately,\" Ethan replied, chewing on a burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth let Claire out in front of her house, right next to Elizabeth's. \"That was one of the best nights I've had in a while,\" Claire smiled. \"And we're going to your book club tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Elizabeth smiled, biting her lip as she looked Claire over. She had a strange feeling inside. Like this was a...date. And if it was a date, now would be the best time to exchange a goodnight kiss. Claire didn't saying anything, but she felt the same way. \"W-well, goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight,\" Claire smiled. \"Sweet dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was happy to find that the house was fire-free and all three of her children were getting ready to go to sleep. \"Brad?\" Claire said, knocking on her son's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom?\" Brad said, worried his mother would come in and see the videos of pregnant women he was indulging himself in before bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking to see if you're okay. Don't have a heart attack,\" Claire laughed. \"Have a good night's sleep, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Brad said, the mood ruined for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire crawled into bed herself, unaware how true her words \"sweet dreams\" were about to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire rolled over in her bed, and found Elizabeth's belly waiting for her on the other side.  Their larger-than-life bellies clashed, bouncing off each other.  \"Oof!  We REALLY need to stop doing that...\" Elizabeth joked, as her belly shook with each laugh.  \"Jeez, we have what, sixteen babies between us?  That's gotta be a record, right?\" Claire asked, rubbing her monstrous belly as she did so.  \"Yep, we're two big, fat Octomoms.\" Elizabeth said, before leaning in to kiss Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two wildly pregnant women could kiss, the door was suddenly opened.  Brad Sr. entered the room, with a large belly of his own, but definitely didn't nearly rival Claire and Elizabeth's bellies.  \"Claire?  Elizabeth?  What the hell is going on?\" he asked, shocked at what was happening.  \"Brad, please let me expla--*THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire awoke with a start, shocked how real that dream felt.  To her surprise, her bedroom was pitch black.  She glanced at the clock, and saw that it was four in the morning.  She was just about to go back to sleep, when she felt the movement in her belly again.  Realizing that a mirror was in her bathroom, she attempted to go to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempt would be the right word.  Not accustomed to her new weight, she struggled immensely to get out from her bed, and waddled (yes, she had developed a full-on waddle) to the bathroom.  <i>How much did I eat last night?</i> she thought to herself.  Finally reaching her destination, Claire turned on the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned.  That was the only word to describe how she felt.  Her belly was massive, not nearly as big as in her dreams, but she could easily pass for a woman eight months pregnant.  Her belly button had popped out, and to her surprise, there were no stretchmarks.  As she was wearing only a bra and panties, she ran her hand over her bare belly, and felt a fairly firm kick in response, which elicited a gasp from Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant,\" she thought out loud, \"I'm over 40, and I'm pregnant.\" she said, as another kick confirmed her thoughts.  She briefly rubbed her belly, before deciding what to do next.  \"I need to go to the hospital.  Get this checked out...\" she said.  Claire decided that she should check on her kids to make sure they were okay.  Bella was sleeping over at a friend's house, but Brittany and Brad were in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled towards Brad's bedroom, and saw that he was fast asleep.  Claire also noticed that he had developed a slight belly, similar to Ethan's, the worker at the health store at the mall.  <i>Could Brad be...no...</i>she thought.  After all, men couldn't get pregnant, as far as she knew.  She tapped Brad's shoulder a few times.  \"Brad.  Brad, sweetie, wake up.\" she said, in a loving tone.  Brad slowly woke up, and his eyes were drawn to his mother's round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped up, covering his crotch, as he had gotten a little \"excited\".  \"Mom?  What...what happened to you?\" he asked.  \"Honey, I...think I'm pregnant.  I'm about to go to the hospital to get things sorted out.\" she said, nervous about the hospital visit.  \"You know what?  I'll go with you, just so you won't have to go trough it alone.  Hey, I'll even get an ultrasound done just so you won't be the only one doing it.\"  Brad Jr. joked, trying to make his mother feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Brittany asked, standing in Brad's doorway.  She too was sporting a belly, which was around the size of a six-month pregnant belly, as it peeked through her pajamas.  \"Brittany...you too?\" Claire asked, shocked that her daughter appeared to be pregnant as well.  \"I think so, mom.  I don't know how it happened, though!  I swear I haven't had sex!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I believe you.  Something's happening to us.\" Claire replied, as she felt a few kicks.  Randomly, she thought to call Elizabeth.  She had helped her through her previous pregnancies, and she knew that she would be able to help this time around, mysterious circumstances or not.  Claire dialed her number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings, Elizabeth picked up.  \"Elizabeth?\" Claire asked.  \"Let me guess.  It's happening to you too?\" she replied.  \"What you mean?\" Claire asked, trying to play dumb, because she was fairly afraid of being a mother again, especially at her age.  \"You know what I mean, Claire.  We're pregnant.\" she said bluntly.  \"I...yes.  We are.  I'm going to the hospital, do you want me to pick you up?\" she asked.  \"That'd probably be smart.  And make sure you bring the van.  The kids are coming along, too.\" Elizabeth said, hanging up.  Without further ado, Claire donned a bathrobe, which revealed the entirety of her large belly, and left with Brad and Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to Elizabeth's house, Claire thought about the dream.  She knew that in reality, she and Elizabeth had been getting closer, and if she continued down this slippery slope, she might end up hurting Brad Sr., Elizabeth, or both.  She didn't know what to do, as she had felt attraction to Elizabeth that she hadn't felt in years.  Claire continued to rub her bared belly, as she felt more kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very brief drive, they pulled up at Elizabeth's house.  Elizabeth waddled out, as Roy, Veronica, Christine, and Monica followed after.  Elizabeth's belly size was identical to Claire's, easily shown by the large sliver of skin that her t-shirt displayed.  Her kids also sported bellies, similar in size to Brad's own belly.  Elizabeth heaved herself into the passenger seat, and looked at Claire.  \"Ready?\" she asked.  \"Ready.\" Claire responded, although she wasn't so sure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even in Claire's minivan, there was barely enough room for all of the Perkins and Dawson family members. Claire and Elizabeth both had to move their seats back, now that they both looked full-term pregnant with one baby each. This gave their collective seven children even less room. Brad and Brittany were squeezed together, Brad looking away as best he could and trying not to think about his sister's own pregnant belly pressing against him. One useful tactic to get his mind off of his own pregnant fetish was the idea that he, too, could be pregnant somehow. He also woke up more bloated than last night and had been getting steadily bigger. And if his mother and sister could suddenly wake up pregnant, why couldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was mixed with fear and excitement. It wasn't a lifelong interest like it was for Brad, but in the past year or so, Brittany became enamored with the idea of, one day, becoming pregnant. And it went deeper than that: she looked at pictures of pregnant models, listened to the stories of women about their own pregnancies. Thinking about being pregnant \u2014 truly being pregnant right now \u2014 was an alluring thought, even if the idea of taking care of a baby was daunting. Little did she know she was carrying three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veronica, scoot over!\" Roy protested, nudging his hips against his twin sister in the seat across from Brad and Brittany. \"Your ass is so fat from eating so much junk food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not the one here who's getting fat,\" Veronica said, prodding Roy's belly, which had gotten larger over the night like everyone else's, although not to the degree of his mother and some of his sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose sisters, Christine and Monica, were sitting in the back of the minivan, one hand on both of their swollen bellies, clearly pregnant. \"Can you...feel moving?\" Christine asked, turning to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica nodded. \"I always thought feeling kicking while pregnant would feel like an alien or a monster inside my womb, but this feels sort of nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine looked back at her own growing stomach, not well concealed by the flimsy t-shirt she threw on when Elizabeth gathered the family together to go to the hospital. \"Yeah, it does feel nice. I wonder if we can still go running if we're pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kids, don't assume you're pregnant just...just because Mrs. Perkins and I are,\" Elizabeth said, turning around slightly to Christine and Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Dawson, we're pregnant,\" Brittany said, rolling up her pajama top to reveal her sloped skin. \"I can feel movement and...just look at me. Somehow, we're all pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone should call Bella,\" Claire worried, looking at the roadsigns to find the way to the hospital. \"See if the same thing's happened to her. Although she hasn't been gaining any weight the past few days, so she's thankfully safe.\" A big sign for a 24-hour Chinese buffet passed by the car and the stomachs of all the passengers collectively rumbled, making them all blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we could just stop for a little bit,\" Veronica said bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get to the hospital and find out what's happening!\" Roy protested, despite his own monumental cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mijo, if we really are pregnant, getting to the hospital faster isn't going to change much,\" Elizabeth smiled sympathetically at her son, rubbing her belly. \"Claire, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have expected all eyes to be on the eight people coming to a buffet at four in the morning, two of which were massively pregnant, with one wearing a bathrobe and letting her bare belly hang out. But surprisingly, people paid little attention to Claire and Elizabeth's families. Even more surprising, the place was packed. Men and women with bellies of varying, but large, sizes walked back and forth between their tables and the food, some talking quietly with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never thought we could have a family. It's like a miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I'm going to do. We just got engaged and we haven't had sex yet. How do I tell him I'm four months pregnant with quadruplets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of us was going to go to a sperm bank at some point. Now we're both pregnant and we should embrace it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same thing must be happening all over town,\" Monica said quietly, one hand rubbing her belly. While they may not have been getting attention for their pregnancies, quite a few people were checking out the attractive company that walked in. Not only had their bellies grown overnight, but their chests were now pushing E cups, or more in the case of Claire and Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all piled up their plates with noodles, sweet and sour chicken and pork, big scoops of cooked vegetables, Sichuan beef, dumplings, and bowls of rice and squeezed together at the few available tables. Brad found himself face to face with Elizabeth, half of her belly visible under the table. He'd always thought Elizabeth was an attractive older woman but until he saw her pregnant belly, he didn't think much else about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I spill something on my shirt?\" Elizabeth asked Brad, who didn't realized he'd been staring directly at her for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, sorry. I just drifted off,\" he said, blushing brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe families packed away plates and plates of food, any drowsiness they felt after waking up at four in the morning absorbed by their monstrous hunger. Claire and Elizabeth alone finished off eight big plates, one for each baby they were pregnant with. Claire looked at her phone, a text back from Bella telling her she was fine and understood that they were all at the hospital. \"Wow, we've been eating here for nearly two hours,\" Claire said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the hospital's probably open for walk-ins,\" Elizabeth smiled, looking over at Claire. Like her neighbor, her dream last night involved the two in bed together, massively pregnant, until Brad Sr. walked in. \"But if we're all ready, let's go!\" Elizabeth stood up, the meal widening her belly and making her shirt, already too small for her pregnant frame, roll up, revealing her smooth, brown belly to Brad, who stiffened up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let's go!\" Brad said, hurrying toward the car as Claire gave the buffet manager her credit card, making a conscious decision not to look at the receipt. She couldn't imagine how much she spent at this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line at the hospital was thankfully much smaller than it was at the Chinese buffet. \"E-excuse me, we need to see an OB/GYN,\" Claire said, looking back at the group with her. \"All of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist looked a bit confused but typed a few strokes on his computer. \"Alright, Dr. Stevens can see you now. I don't know if you want to go in one at a time or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll all go in together,\" Elizabeth said, smiling at her children. \"If this is what we think it is...we should all be there to support one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Stevens was an attractive young man, brushing his shining golden hair as his office filled up. \"My, the receptionist said this was going to be an unusual appointment, but this is...quite the turn-out. So, who first? I have two examining tables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you go first,\" Brittany said, smiling sweetly at her own pregnant mother. On top of being pregnant herself, Brittany was looking forward to seeing Claire's pregnancy develop right before her eyes. She couldn't remember Claire when she was pregnant with Bella very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled. \"I think...Brad should go first,\" she said, turning to her son. \"And Roy. Elizabeth and I know we're pregnant, but I'm most worried about you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shrugged and got on the examining table, assuming he wasn't pregnant at all. Brad was more nervous, especially because when leaning back, his erection was more visible. \"Alright, if you say so,\" Dr. Stevens said, running his wand over Brad and Roy's bare stomachs. \"...huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Veronica said, leaning to see the ultrasound screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like you are both pregnant with twins,\" Dr. Stevens said. \"I've heard about some other doctors in the city seeing pregnant men, but I thought it was just a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you're right, bro. You weren't getting fat,\" Veronica chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you're still laughing when you get an ultrasound and we see how knocked up you are!\" Roy said, the shock of learning that he was pregnant making his voice angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica got on the examining table after him, Brittany taking Brad's place. Dr. Stevens examined them as well, turning the screens to everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Dawson, your daughter is also pregnant with twins. But Mrs. Perkins, you're going to be a grandma to triplets.\" Veronica and Brittany's faces were both masks of astonishment, but underneath hers, Brittany was ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Monica and Christine. When they rolled up their shirts, it was clear that they were bigger than any of the other kids. Dr. Stevens had a small grin go across his face as he examined them, his hand brushing against their growing breasts. They passed it off as accidents but looked at each other with surprise. \"And you're both carrying quadruplets,\" Dr. Stevens said. \"Although when there's that many, it's also possible that some more could be hiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Elizabeth gulped. If they were even bigger than Christine and Monica...how many could they be carrying? Slowly, they heaved themselves onto the seats, Dr. Stevens' smile getting even bigger, his breast-groping less subtle. But, as he examined them, his lusty smile faded into a perplexed look at the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having trouble getting an exact number,\" he said. \"There's...a lot here. You're all around four months pregnant, but for you to be this pregnant and not know it until now...I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth bit her lip and looked at Claire, wanting to reach over and hold her hand. Claire kept looking at Dr. Stevens. \"Doctor, you can tell how many there are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, he sighed. \"I think I've got it now. Somehow, you are both...pregnant with eight babies. You're octo-moms.\"</span></div></div>",

Brittany held her hand over her belly, one of the only women in the car glad to be pregnant, although the additional news that she was going to have triplets was intimidating to say the least. Veronica and her older sisters Monica and Christine were mute, none of them wanting to feel their growing stomachs. Monica and Christine were the closest to \"showing,\" both of them pregnant with quadruplets. By far the most terrified passengers in the van were Roy and Brad, who discovered that they were pregnant men. The fact that most of the car's passengers hadn't had sex in the past four months was the furthest things from their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite the talk Claire and Elizabeth both shared about wanting to be pregnant again, neither of them were prepared for the news that they were pregnant with octuplets. As Claire drove, Elizabeth stroked her belly, her face dazed and exhausted. <i>Eight babies. I guess I really will be as big as I was in my dream...my dream with Claire</i>. Claire's eyes were focused on the road and she had no time to stroke her belly, but she was sharing many of Elizabeth's thoughts, including the reminiscing about how sexy their dream was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, perfect,\" Roy said, looking at his phone. \"Now it's time for school too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm going to school today,\" Veronica said, shaking her head quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids, please,\" Elizabeth said. \"Whatever all of this is...it's more important than ever that you get your education. I'm still going to work too, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you...you can't go to work with a big belly,\" Christine protested. \"How would you even fit into your work uniform?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about your mom,\" Elizabeth said with a forced smile. \"Now c'mon, we'll stop by our house quickly so you can get your things and then take you in. I'll write you a note so you're excused for being late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for you two,\" Claire said, looking at Brittany and Brad in the rear-view mirror. \"You'll do fine at school today. And...I have a feeling you're not the only ones who woke up with a 'surprise' today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany and Brad nodded as Claire pulled in front of their houses. Elizabeth took a deep breath as she heaved herself out of the car, hand on top of her belly, as she waddled into the house. \"Alright, have a good day at school,\" she said as Roy and Veronica angrily passed her. \"You'll both be fine. We'll all be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, mom,\" they both grumbled under their breath, getting into Claire's minivan. Claire didn't bother getting out, both because she was driving the kids back anyway and because she'd gotten too big to easy maneuver herself. When the Perkins and Dawson kids, minus Christine and Monica, got into the car, Claire drove off to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth struggled up the stairs, gripping the handlebar and taking deep breaths. \"I don't remember this being so hard last time,\" she complained. \"Then again, this thing grew more slowly,\" she said, patting her belly, \"and I was around 20 years younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Need help?\" Monica and Christine said in unison, looking up the staircase at their swollen-bellied mother. Elizabeth's back was arched strongly, making her belly stick out even further than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I'm fine,\" Elizabeth smiled, sweat beginning to bead on her forehead. \"You both...take care of yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer oldest twins shrugged and headed out the door to their own jobs, already changed into some clothing that would conceal their stomachs some more. When they left, Elizabeth let out a groan. \"Only a few months left until summer. Why couldn't this have happened in the summer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally at the top of the stairs, Elizabeth waddled into her bedroom, stripping out of the flimsy pajamas she was using to conceal her pregnant body on the trip and looked through her closet at the selection she had available. Thankfully, Claire's fortuitous plan to wear maternity bras was still working out well as Elizabeth's swelling chest was held in place snuggly. Now she just needed something for the rest of her body. The maternity clothes she bought with Claire proved to be too small, but she'd bought a shirt that was close enough to her work uniform: a white collared shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth struggled to button up when there was a knock at the door and the sound of the door slowly opening. \"Mrs. Dawson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth waddled out, recognizing the voice. \"Bella? Up here, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella went up the stairs, her eyes opening wide when she saw Elizabeth, shirt open and belly on display. \"Mrs...Dawson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Elizabeth, sweetie,\" Elizabeth smiled with a blush. \"And yeah...I'm surprised too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella continued to stare before gulping. \"Is...the same thing happening to my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded. \"And to a lesser extent, your sister and my daughters.\" She thought it would be a good idea to leave out the \"pregnant brother\" details for now. \"What are you still doing here, Bella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got dropped off at home but no one was here,\" Bella said. \"Would you...be able to drive me to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckled. \"Here I thought you were playing hooky. Yes, I can do that, but first, mind helping me button this thing up?\" Elizabeth looked down at her bare, smooth belly, pulling her shirt over her bulge with little effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Bella said hesitantly, walking over to Elizabeth and starting to button the bottom of the shirt across her belly. \"It's a pretty tight fit. Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're fine,\" Elizabeth said, her smile getting softer. She was impressed with how well-behaved Claire's daughter was. \"I expect this will be pretty tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, Bella's voice cracked some. \"I've never...um...felt a pregnant woman's stomach before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth chuckled. \"Well, what do you think? And I prefer to call it a belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really tight,\" Bella said, her face getting red hot. \"T-there, done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned her belly, bumping Bella away, and modeled herself in front of her mirror. Plenty of skin was showing in the space between the buttons but she didn't have much time. If she didn't show up to work soon, she'd be penalized anyway. \"Good job, Bella. Now, help a pregnant lady down the stairs and we'll get you to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella giggled and nodded, putting her arm around Elizabeth's shoulder and supporting her belly with her other hand as they made it down to Elizabeth's car. She found driving with a big belly took some getting used to, but if Claire could do it, she could do it. Every now at then at a stop, Elizaeth's belly would bump against the steering wheel painfully, but with no other complications, she got Bella to school. \"Thank you, Mrs. Da...Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, dear,\" Elizabeth grinned. \"Say hi to your mom for me.\" With that, Elizabeth headed to her restaurant, waddling quickly inside, burning red with embarrassment when Carol saw her. The look on Carol's face was pure evil pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well,\" Carol said, looking Elizabeth over. \"Elizabeth, care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth took a deep sigh. \"Well, Mrs. Phillips, as you can see...I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you just,\" Carol cackled, slapping one hand on top of Elizabeth's belly, rubbing it slowly. \"I don't know how you hid this big bulge for so long. Back with that ex-husband of yours or was this a freebie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, leave her alone!\" Joann said, waddling up, her own belly bigger since yesterday. Quite a bit bigger. \"I don't see you giving me huff for my pregnancy. And besides, you're getting a little wide too. Maybe you're pregnant too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol fumed. \"That's enough, Joann. And I'm only bigger because of bloating due to some horrific energy drink I tried yesterday at the mall.\" Carol gave Elizabeth a stink eye and went back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later,\" Joann said, flashing Elizabeth a wink as she went back to take care of some customers. Elizabeth nodded and got out her notepad to start taking customer's orders. She knew telling Carol the added detail of her eight occupants would only make the day worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork was exceedingly difficult with the huge belly, her shirt quickly becoming soaked with sweat from the exhausting of carrying around such a heavy load. Some customers were uncomfortable with her ill-fitting maternity clothes, others seemed <u>very</u> happy to have Elizabeth as their waitress. Toward the end of her shift, Elizabeth was running meals back and forth to a big party, Carol watching intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's heart was pounding from the sea of emotions and exhaustion, which set off a reaction: a kick. Which led to another kick, and another, and another. <i>Oh no</i>, Elizabeth thought, reaching down to her belly with one hand while the other hand held a tray of food. But it was no good. A series of strong kicks popped her shirt open, her big bare belly on display. It made Elizabeth let out a yelp and drop the tray, food getting all over the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth!\" Carol yelled. \"You're cut for the day! Go home before your water breaks or you start lactating on the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol!\" Joann yelled back as Elizabeth bit her lip, putting her notepad back and clocking out, storming out to her car, still holding her belly with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to her car and, after taking a big sigh, began to sob, cradling her belly and feeling the kicking inside. \"Oh, I want to be a good mother to all of you but...I'm going to need some help.\" Only one person came into her mind when she thought about comfort. \"Claire...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Health class started much differently than it had for the rest of the year, as the school's principal, Mrs. Decker, stood in front of the class, armed crossed, face clearly rocked with exhaustion and confusion. Mrs. Decker was about Claire and Elizabeth's age and her body looked it now too. Her crossed arms accentuated her heavy chest that was resting on top and her blouse was tight around her new curves that she hoped the class wouldn't see. \"As I'm sure many of you now know,\" she began with a sigh, \"an unsettlingly high number of students have reported discovering that they are pregnant. Many of those students' parents have complained and the school is looking into this issue. We do not believe this is some sort of 'pregnancy pact' like what happened in Texas in 2006 but in the mean time, we feel it would be best to include...sex ed into your health class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classroom was full of murmuring, with Roy and Veronica sinking low into their desks, faces turning red. Brittany wondered who else in her class might be pregnant and considered whether she should come forward with the news about her own triplets. Roy and Veronica were fixed on their pregnancies remaining a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that not all of the school is affected, although there have been some reports of some male students discovering that they are pregnant,\" Mrs. Decker continued. \"I have also contacted other schools in the area and it seems that this is not an issue specific to our institution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily, none of the boys on our varsity basketball team got this mystery pregnancy and half the team at North Central High had to drop out due to pregnancies, so it looks like we're going to qualify for the national tournament!\" Mr. Franklin said triumphantly, getting a few hoots from the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan, please,\" Mrs. Decker hissed, \"I know you didn't get spared, so I don't know what you're cheering about. Behave in front of the students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Franklin nodded as Mrs. Decker turned back to the classroom. \"Now, because some students are pregnant and others are not, I want to remind everyone that this is not the time for a 'witch hunt' to find out which of your classmates is expectant. We are a united community and that is not appropriate. If anyone has any other questions, you can see me in my office, totally confidentially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell them about your three little surprises?\" Mr. Franklin mumbled, getting a nasty look from Mrs. Decker in response as she headed out the door. \"Alright class, you heard the principal. No talk about bones for the day. We need to talk about birth control. Kat? You gave a little talk yesterday. Why don't you come up here and talk to the class about safe sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classroom turned to Kat, who had her black and blue hair tied in a tight bun and was huddled close to her desk. \"I-I don't have anything prepared, Mr. Franklin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, neither do I, but you sounded like you must have at least some good advice. Please come up here, Kat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, getting an annoyed sigh from Mr. Franklin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. DeLerro, come present to the class or get detention, your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking with embarrassment, Kat waddled to the front of the classroom, her swollen belly stretching her tiny beige dress to its limits. Her small frame made her belly look even bigger: almost as big as Claire and Elizabeth were this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look,\" Kat said, her face burning, \"it wasn't like this yesterday. I just woke up and...and boom, belly.\" She looked at Mr. Franklin, who was already on his phone, then back at the class. \"But you know what? This is bullshit. I know I'm not the only person here who's pregnant and just because I'm carrying sextuplets doesn't mean I should be singled out as the 'pregnant student.' But if I'm going to be...then I'll make the best of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat rolled up her shirt as the class gasped, showing off her bare belly. \"It looks good, doesn't it? Nice and round, still no stretch marks. It's not really my thing, but I think I look pretty cute, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. DeLerro,\" Mr. Franklin said, rubbing his temples, \"you aren't supposed to be encouraging students to be pregnant. You're supposed to be telling them how to prevent it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get this way by having unprotected sex!\" Kat snapped back. \"The doctor said I'm four months pregnant and I haven't had sex in over a year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No surprise there,\" one of the students in the scoffed, getting loud laughs from the classroom. Kat's face started to turn red again. Roy blushed as well. He'd always thought that Kat was the only mature, attractive girl in the school but never worked up the courage to say anything to her. Now, he had an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Roy was standing up, Brittany beat him to the punch, getting up in the middle of the desks and yelling at her classmates. \"What are you all laughing at her for? Most of you are probably pregnant from this...this mystery pregnancy. And she's the only one brave enough to admit it and show it off.\" Brittany felt her cheeks getting red, not daring to look over at Kat. \"A-and you know what else? I'm also-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and Mr. Franklin let out a long sigh. \"Thank God for these health classes being so short,\" he said to himself quietly. \"Alright, I've got to do this whole thing over again for another batch of kids, so everyone out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany had mixed feelings about whether she should make made her admission to the class or not as everyone filed out, but as Veronica approached her, her neighbor's feelings were clear. \"Don't tell anyone,\" she hissed. \"You'll be tormented, just like Kat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, Kat,\" Roy said, gripping his sweaty palms against his backpack's straps, walking over to the heavily pregnant girl as she got her own backpack together. \"You were really...um...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't even think of an insult on the spot?\" Kat scoffed, heaving her belly up as she brought her bag up, bumping against her bag. \"Try again next time, asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I...\" Roy tried to say. \"Great,\" he groaned, walking back with his twin sister and Brittany. \"Well this day just keeps getting worse and worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's just getting started,\" Veronica said, patting him on the back. \"See you at the end of the day, bro. We'll do something fun after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the day went on, with all three of the high-school aged Dawson and Perkins children going on different schedules as they went through their classes. The school's history teacher, Mr. Greenly, was open about his pregnancy, thankfully just one, and said while he didn't know how it happened, his partner was happy that it looked like they wouldn't have to wait through the long waiting list for an adoption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tanner, the school literature professor, was sporting a wide, quadruplet bump, trying her best to hide it behind her desk, catching herself when she patted it aimlessly. Ms. Tanner had feathery brown hair and pregnancy made it shine, but anytime she had to move or had her belly impede her teaching in any way, a bright blush spread across her face. Ms. Tanner was single and did not look prepared or excited to be a mother in five months, let alone five days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the teacher who stood out the most was Ms. Renee Flora, advanced chemistry. She had always been on the student's top 3 for \"hottest teacher\" and pregnancy did not slow that down. Ms. Flora was sporting another sextuplet belly, barely contained by her button-up blouse, letting plenty of bare skin and her popped-out belly button be revealed to the whole classroom. Halfway through class, Ms. Flora smiled to the students and stroked her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, would anyone mind if I undid these buttons? It's a little tight down there?\" The class was too stunned to respond and Brittany watched, mouth agape, as her teacher revealed her huge bare belly to the class. \"Ooh, that feels nice. And it's just going to keep getting bigger, so either they need to make an octuple-XL shirt that's still cute or I'm going to be showing you all my bare belly a lot more often.\" The class laughed nervously as Brittany wondered what she would look like with a round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Flora beamed throughout the rest of the class, looking over the students with her violet eyes from behind her thick-framed glasses, short black bangs having to be brushed out of the way every now and then. \"That's all for today,\" she hummed as the bell got close to ringing. \"Oh, and that's the last class for today. Everyone have a good time and be careful out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone left, Ms. Flora stopped Brittany. \"Ms. Flora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Renee,\" she giggled. \"Brittany, your performance on your chemistry tests has been remarkable. You're understanding concepts very quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" Brittany smiled, putting one lock of hair behind her ear. \"You're a really good teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee chuckled. \"Thank you too. I have a little chemistry experiment I'm working on and I am in dire need of a good lab assistant. Mind staying after class to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany thought it over, her eyes constantly going to Renee's belly. \"S-sure! Let me just tell my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;go to mall w/o me&gt; she sent to Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;ok. Ill still take roy &amp; veronica?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;sure&gt; Brittany sent back, turning back to Renee. \"Alright, no problem! So, what are we looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee went into her supply closet, filled with all sorts of elements and chemicals that could be hazardous in the wrong hands, and brought out a beaker filled with black liquid. \"Have you heard of an energy drink called Xpect?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the Perkins residence, Claire finally arrived home.  She closed the door and walked inside.  She sighed, realizing that having eight babies, especially at her age, would be an incredibly difficult task. <i>Oh well.  At least I won't be going through this alone.</i>  she thought, rubbing her belly as her babies kicked lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her car keys on the table, she walked upstairs, deciding to get dressed.  This was difficult to say the least.  As she was in slightly worse shape than Elizabeth, she <b>REALLY</b> struggled to get up the stairs.  In fact, halfway up, Claire had to take a seat, as her belly was too much weight.  Realizing that she had to make it up somehow, she slowly scooted her slightly larger rear up, step by step, until she finally made it to the top.  \"This pregnancy's going to suck...\" Claire huffed, using her bathrobe to wipe the sweat of her face and enlarged belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room, Claire removed her bathrobe and donned the maternity wear that she bought yesterday.  She knew that she would get much, much bigger, and it would probably be a wise investment to take a trip to Baby Universe to buy some bigger clothes, as the maternity blouse that she bought was already tightly confining her spherical belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that she also had to go to the Book Club with Elizabeth, she figured that she'd have enough time to make a quick stop at the mall.  After a prolonged expedition down the stairs, Claire headed out.  Suddenly, her phone rang.  \"Hello?\" she asked.  \"Hey, baby, it's me...\"said the voice on the other end, sounding a bit restless.  \"Brad?  Hey, how's your trip going?\" Claire asked, wincing slightly as her belly bounced against the steering wheel as she arrived at a stop sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...uh...good.\" he replied.  \"Really?  It sounded like you were having an alright time the other day...\" Claire trailed off.  \"Well, me and everyone else...uh...there's something wrong...\"Brad Sr said, clearly worried.  \"Okay, well let's just say you're gonna have a big surprise when you get ho--wait, sorry Elizabeth's calling.  I'll talk to you later.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire ended the conversation with Brad, and answered Elizabeth's call.  \"Elizabeth?\" Claire asked, as she could hear crying on the other end.  \"Claire...I need you to pick me up...\" Elizabeth said, her weeping continuing.  \"Alright, where are you?\" Claire asked.  \"The...Olive...Branch...\" Elizabeth cried.  Worried, Claire drove off, trying to help her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Claire arrived at The Olive Branch.  She pulled up to Elizabeth's car, and saw that she was inside, head pressed against the steering wheel.  Claire honked her horn, as Elizabeth looked over.  Claire gestured for her to come.  Elizabeth stopped crying, and opened the car door, revealing her bare belly, obviously not contained by her white work shirt.  After a waddle, she made it into Claire's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth, what happened?\" Claire asked.  \"These stupid babies started kicking so hard that my stupid shirt popped open, and Carol made me leave...\" she said, resting her hand on her belly, the occupants shifting in response.  \"Well, I was just about to go to Baby Universe to get some bigger clothes, do you wanna come with?\"  Claire asked.  \"Yeah, sure!  Then we can go to the Book Club after!\" Elizabeth said, her spirits lightening.  Elizabeth was able to button the top few buttons of her shirt again, but this meant that her entire belly would show.  Still, it was better than nothing, as Claire drove to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short drive later, the two pregnant ladies arrived at their destination.  They waddled into the mall, and slowly walked past the health store.  Ethan and Kenna were propped outside of the store, still selling the Xpect.  Their shirts prominently displayed their bellies, which were exactly the same size as Brad Jr's and Roy's.  \"Ugh!  I can't believe I'm pregnant, with twins for that matter!\" Kenna said angrily.  \"At least you have an excuse for getting fat!  Look at me!\" Ethan declared, prodding his own swollen stomach.  \"Uh, Ethan?  You <b>MAY</b> want to get that looked at...\" Kenna said, stopping as Barbara, their boss, walked by, holstering a box on her large stomach, which was a bit smaller than Claire and Elizabeth's bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, will you two quit whining? I'm pregnant with quintuplets and you don't see me complaining!\" she said, clearly using her stomach as a shelf.  The two burn-outs sighed, as they returned to trying to sell Xpect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling to Baby Universe, they were greeted by the store's owner, who was clearly pregnant.  She wore a light purple maternity blouse, and she was about the same size as Claire and Elizabeth, but only because she was a bit further along than them. \"Hey, again!  Can I interest you two in anything?\" she asked.  \"Actually, we were looking for some maternity clothes.\" Elizabeth said.  \"I can see that!\" the owner said, staring at her bared belly.  \"You two look awfully far along to be needing bigger maternity clothes...\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're having multiples.\" Claire said.  \"Oh, really?  Twins?  Triplets?  I'm actually five months with quadruplets myself.\" she said, running her hands over her belly.  \"Heh, no.  We're both having octuplets.\" said Elizabeth bluntly.  The owner stopped rubbing her belly as her eyes widened.  \"Okay...well we do have some stuff in the multiples section that should work for now...\" she answered slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing a handful of maternity clothes, Claire and Elizabeth waddled to checkout.  \"Could I interest you in any cribs?\" the owner asked.  \"No, thanks.  I didn't bring my credit card, and I think we'll be buying a lot of them...\" Claire responded.  Making their purchases, the two pregnant mothers exited Baby Universe, and waddled down the mall.  Suddenly, their bellies rumbled.  \"Do you wanna...\" Claire began.  \"I...think that there'll be food at the Book Club.  We should just hold off for a little while.\" Elizabeth said, although she was pretty hungry herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste anymore time, the two waddled back to Claire's car, heading to the Book Club meeting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both of Elizabeth's hands were exploring her roundness. \"I don't remember feeling this heavy when I was pregnant before,\" Elizabeth said. \"Even when I was nine months pregnant with twins, my shirts never popped off or felt so tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because our bellies just got so big at once,\" Claire said, looking over at her friend. \"Normally, we...grow, slowly, over 40 weeks. But our stomachs started popping out of us over the course of a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth changed her rubbing pattern, just moving her fingertips across her curves. \"If we got this big in one day, how much larger do you think we'll be tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire shuddered, her dream with Elizabeth with both carrying preposterously large bellies flashing into her mind. \"I-I don't want to think about that,\" Claire said as the light turned. \"Do you think our kids are going to get larger along with too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed, palms resting against both sides of her massive belly. \"I hope not, for their sake. I don't know what they're going to do about their pregnancies. I don't even know, really, what I'm going to do about these eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever happens, you'll do a great job raising them,\" Claire smiled, blushing as she looked over at her friend and neighbor. Elizabeth might say how big and uncomfortable she feels, but pregnancy really agreed with her, Claire thought, biting her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-careful,\" Elizabeth said. Claire realized she'd been gazing at Elizabeth too long and wasn't watching the road. She straightened out and, with Elizabeth's directions, made it to the local library. Waddling inside, the building was surprisingly busy, with men and women complaining to librarians that all of the pregnancy advice books were already checked out. Some people were looking through medical books nervously, others smiling pleasantly as they read through books on cooking and raising families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back here,\" Elizabeth said, waddling to the conference rooms in the back of the library. As she walked, she had to stretch her back out to relieve her back of some of the pressure and weight of her belly. Doing so made her maternity dress she just bought ride up her skin some, revealing her bare, creamy brown belly. Blushing, Claire waddled quickly over and pulled it back down, her belly rubbing against Elizabeth's as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, I figured you didn't want-\" Claire began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was the right call,\" Elizabeth smiled sweetly, her eyelids narrowing. \"Thank you, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's blush turned even brighter, fanning her face as Elizabeth turned her back to open the doors. \"Hi, everyone. I brought a friend along. I hope that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine,\" Jennifer, the librarian leading the discussion, said. The chairs were arraigned in a circle, almost all of the other chairs filled with women: some with big bellies, some with bellies that were just starting to show, and some with no signs of pregnancy at all. Although that last group was definitely in the minority. Jennifer was a tall woman, around Claire and Elizabeth's age, with her light brown hair tied up in a messy bun, with thin glasses, a long black dress, and a beige blouse that was containing the beginnings of her belly but not doing a good job of hiding her size. \"Nice to meet you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire,\" Claire said, nodding politely as Elizabeth waddled to an available seat next to another familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could make it, hon,\" Joann smiled. Her belly had grown dramatically since Elizabeth last saw her, looking only a few inches in circumference smaller than Elizabeth and her black top only accentuated her size, both of her belly and her breasts, which had always been on the large side. \"Hi, I'm Joann. I work with Elizabeth,\" she said, reaching a hand out to Claire, who sat beside Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Claire smiled, shaking Joann's hand, turning to the women next to her. \"Hello, nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we should do introductions,\" Jennifer said. \"I'm Jennifer, head of community outreach programs at the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us about your pregnancy,\" another woman, a middle-eastern woman with scruffy, short black hair, a green top, jeans, and a prominent belly said. \"Since most of us are pregnant, we might as well include those details along with our introductions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women chuckled and Jennifer nodded. \"Good point, Asma. In that case, I'm Jennifer, and I'm four months pregnant with twins. Next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her was a young black woman with a tight afro with a long blue dress and a sweater over top. \"I'm Rachel, a student at the state college and thankfully, I'm not pregnant,\" she said with a chuckle. \"No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Joann. \"Hey y'all, I'm Joann, I'm a waitress and hostess alongside this sexy mom-to-be,\" she said, patting Elizabeth on the shoulder. \"And I'm five months pregnant with triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled and went next. \"I'm Elizabeth, a waitress, and I'm four months pregnant with...octuplets.\" The room gasped as Elizabeth hung her head, blushing as she rubbed her hugeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Claire...stay at home mom...also pregnant with eight.\" Claire said, blushing as well, reaching over one hand to Elizabeth's knee, patting her gently. Elizabeth sat up quickly at her pat, gulping as she looked over at her friend, wishing she'd touch her leg a little further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're next,\" the woman next to Claire said. \"I'm Tina-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and I'm her wife, Joselyn,\" the woman next to her said with a smile, putting a hand on her belly. Tina was a tiny, pale woman, with rosy red lips and brilliant blue eyes, all wrapped up in a plain outfit of a blue-and-white striped shirt and jeans. Joselyn was a South-East Asian woman, with a big smile and a big leather jacket over her t-shirt. \"And we're both four months pregnant with quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it being in a relationship when you're both pregnant?\" Joann asked with a curious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoselyn giggled. \"Well...the big bellies just started this morning, so we don't quite know yet,\" she said, turning to her wife and taking her cheek in her hands. \"But we're both looking forward to finding out.\" Claire and Elizabeth looked away awkwardly, both blushing, wondering how they would be in bed, their octuplet bellies bumping against one another as they come together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Taylor,\" the next woman said, ignoring Tina and Joselyn as they nuzzled noses. \"I'm a teacher and as you can see-\" she said, lifting her shirt and patting her six-pack abs, \"not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a few days ago, I didn't think I was pregnant either,\" Asma smiled. \"Be careful. As Tina and Joselyn show, it can happen to <u>anybody</u>.\" Rachel shuddered on the other side of the room. \"I'm Asma. I'm a writer, a socialite, a comedian, an actress, all kinds of things. And hopefully these three babies won't slow that down too much,\" she said, patting her belly. \"Only four months in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great introductions,\" Jennifer smiled. \"Hope that makes you feel more at home, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to have other expectant women around,\" Claire smiled back weakly. <i>If I wanted to be around other pregnant people, I guess I could just go home to my kids</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's also nice to have us...update one another on our pregnancies. I know there have been some changes and they have come as a surprise to some of us, but having this room of support is a nice way to overcome that. And Claire, I hope you'll be a part of our support group now too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Claire smiled, looking over at Elizabeth. \"And thank you for taking me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Elizabeth replied quietly. \"You're <u>my</u> support group, after all.\" The two blushed and smiled a little as Jennifer got out the book for them to discuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was a little out of the loop for the discussion, having not read whatever Victorian era romance they were discussing, but she watched Elizabeth intently during the session. Every time Elizabeth opened her mouth, she sounded so smart and incredible and...beautiful. Claire always knew Elizabeth was beautiful, but this felt different. It had felt different for a few days now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was aware of Claire's stares, but didn't know how to interpret them. Did Claire think she was being too talky? Too pretentious? Stuck-up? Elizabeth felt her face getting red and wasn't sure if it was just exhaustion from carrying a heavy pregnancy. Why did she care so much what Claire thought about her? She knew she was a good friend but...she wanted to know if Claire thought more about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen an hour had passed, the room was filling with grumbling sounds. Joann rubbed her belly with a chuckle. \"Sounds like my pups are getting hungry and so is their momma. Good stopping place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Jennifer said with a smile, scooting her chair back to get up. \"Same time next week, ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we don't go into labor before then,\" Joselyn chuckled. \"Hungry, babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina nodded. \"You know I'm not a big eater, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoselyn kissed her on the cheek. \"You pregnant chicks are so cute. C'mon, let's eat out tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stroked her belly as Elizabeth bent down to get her purse, looking up at Claire's hugeness as she did so, loving the view more than she expected. \"S-so...what are you going to do for food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just dinner with the kids. We haven't had a family meal in a while,\" Claire nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth stood up slowly, her belly brushing against Claire's. \"M-maybe we can all have dinner together at your house? Both families?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed. \"S-sure, that sounds great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled and waddled back to the parking lot. Her shirt had risen up again but Claire didn't say anything, deciding to enjoy the view instead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't believe how hungry I feel,\" Claire groaned as she waddled around her kitchen, getting food out of the fridge and making a small mountain on the counter. Elizabeth chuckled and took some of Claire's pans and started the oven up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd better get started quickly. We can do more with the two of us,\" Elizabeth smiled. Their bellies forced them closer together in the already-cramped kitchen and they each secretly hoped and feared they would accidentally bump hips. The doorbell rang as they worked and Brad opened the door to let Monica and Christine inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Brittany?\" Veronica asked, walking into the room to see her older sisters coming inside..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's said she'll be at school late,\" Brad said, blushing as he watched Monica and Christine come inside, their bellies beginning to show. \"H-how are you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" they said in unison. \"You don't have a gaming console, do you?\" Christine asked, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry,\" Brad said. \"I guess we never got that into video games.\" Like their mother, Christine and Monica were incredible attractive, distant eyes behind long lashes as their full lips were pursed just enough. Their bellies were totally covered for now, but underneath, Brad could have seen the same smooth, mocha skin their mother had. Brad had always been attracted to them, but until they started sporting pregnant bellies, he hadn't given a relationship with either of them more than a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself,\" Bella grumbled, walking into the kitchen and sitting in one of the couches. \"You're always more interested in playing sports and Brittany just into weird stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You play a lot of sports?\" Monica asked, turning to Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like video games too?\" Christine asked, turning to Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Brad said with a nervous smile. \"I've seen you go running around the neighborhood a lot...n-not that I watch you or anything.\" He gulped and tried to recover. \"Do you do any sports?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swimming in high school, but you know, it was just to get class credit and stay in shape,\" Monica said, hand over her belly. \"That's all out the window now, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still look great,\" Brad said. Bella turned and gave her brother a \"what the hell\" look as Monica chuckled. \"I mean...it's clear that you take care of yourself, even if you're...we're...pregnant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thanks,\" Monica smiled, trying to stifle her laugher as she turned back to Christine and Bella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd love the game mechanics,\" Christine was telling Bella. \"And what's cool is Dark Souls has a semi-interactive story that you can explore or ignore depending on your preferences. Come over whenever and we can play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Bella said. \"Aren't you both kind of busy with...your babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH don't say babies,\" Veronica said on the other end of the living room, flipping through her cellphone. \"Twins...and you're both having quadruplets...and Mom's having fucking octuplets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get upset now,\" Elizabeth said from the kitchen, turning slightly to look at her kids. \"We're all going to be okay, right? We're tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Roy said, hands on his temples on the chair next to Veronica. \"Learning I'm a pregnant man is a little more stress than I'm used to, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one,\" Brad said slowly, resisting the urge to feel his slowly going belly. Walking around the mall with Veronica and Roy ended up being a terrible idea for Brad. They fought all the time, the news about their pregnancies made them both even antsier, and the mall's maternity clothing store attracted huge crowds that made it even harder to walk around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be nice to know my brother is going through the same thing as me,\" Christine smiled sarcastically, looking at Roy. He rolled his eyes, crossing his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going running with you two,\" Roy protested. \"No matter how many times you ask. If you'd just eat the right food like I do, you wouldn't need to exercise as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if bull penis counts as 'the right food,'\" Veronica chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy started yelling about the importance of trying diverse meals, Monica turned to Brad. \"Maybe you'd like to try running with us? We're in a similar boat, right?\" Monica ran her hand down her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" Brad smiled ear-to-ear. \"I haven't really...gone on a run in a while, but I'm sure I'll be able to get back into it easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Monica chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the families laughed and argued, Ms. Flora's car pulled in front of the Perkins house, Ms. Flora leaning back and letting out a long sigh when she went into park, rubbing her belly. \"This is you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Brittany nodded, looking between Ms. Flora and her belly. \"Thank you for including me in your research...Renee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Flora grinned. \"Oh please, thank you. You're a very talented chemistry student and I made a lot of progress on my research with your help. This Xpect drink...there's something not quite right about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was the weirdest compound I've ever seen,\" Brittany nodded. Ms. Flora bit her lip as she looked at the can of Xpect in her car and turned to Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I give you a very un-scientific theory to see what you think?\" Ms. Flora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Brittany said. \"I've been afraid of being un-scientific around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this drink might be making people pregnant. Men and women too,\" Ms. Flora said. \"I don't really know how, but our research today makes me more suspicious.\" Seeing Brittany's concerned face, Ms. Flora gave a little laugh. \"But let's not get too worried about that right now. I'll see you in class tomorrow, Brittany.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you, Renee,\" Brittany smiled, getting out of the car, waving as she drove off. <i>Hope I get some extra credit out of this...not that I minded spending time with her</i>. Walking inside her family house, she was greeted with a wall of noise and aromas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready, everyone,\" Claire said, smiling when Brittany walked in. \"Ah, perfect timing. Staying at school wasn't too painful, I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was great,\" Brittany smiled, strangely proud that her mother had a bigger pregnant belly than Ms. Flora. \"I was doing some independent research with one of my science teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little doctor,\" Claire smiled, giving Brittany a hug as she waddled to the kitchen table, much larger than usual. \"Alright, I cooked based on how hungry I feel, so hopefully there's going to be enough to eat.\" There was barely any free space on the table with the amount of food laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a lot of you feel hungry, but the thing about being pregnant is...cravings and hunger aren't the same thing,\" Elizabeth said to the rest of the table. \"Although when you carry triplets or more...it can be a little different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Monica and Christine said in unison, putting big portions on their plates. Dinner went off as one would expect: Roy and Veronica argued over portions, Brad awkwardly chatted with Monica, Christine and Bella talked about video games, Brittany made pleasant chat with anyone who would listen, and Claire and Elizabeth talked so shyly, an outsider might think they were flirting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dinner wound down and there was thankfully plenty of leftovers for the next few days, the family began to split between the two houses. Brittany went to her room, rolling up her shirt and admiring her belly, as small as it was, in the mirror. Veronica and Roy hurried back home, trying to get their minds off their pregnancies. Christine took Bella over to the Dawson house to play video games. As Monica was about to join them, Brad went up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, do you want to maybe...go for a walk and keep chatting?\" Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Monica smiled, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you're right, that's weird,\" Brad said. \"I...I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay!\" Monica said, following Christine out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Claire and Elizabeth do to the dishes, groaning as they moved their bellies around. \"Getting heavy?\" Elizabeth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess they're settling in, but not where I want them too,\" Claire sighed. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a bowling ball in here,\" Elizabeth chuckled. \"Can't wait to see what it'll be like in the morning, the way things have been going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed. That's right: each night she woke up even bigger...would that happen again? When the dishes were finally done, Claire gave Elizabeth what she thought was a goodbye hug. \"Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire? Actually, I have a...request,\" Elizabeth said. \"See, I was with my ex the last times I was pregnant and I've never been pregnant...alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same here,\" Claire sighed, rubbing her belly. \"Are you suggesting we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share a bed,\" Elizabeth nodded with a nervous smile. \"You know...for the night. Just to get me comfortable again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'd like that too,\" Claire smiled. Their bellies were inches away as their faces got redder and redder. \"W-well...feel like going to bed now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded with a shy smile. They brushed their teeth washed up and after hesitating, stripped down to their maternity underwear as they got into bed, face-to-face, bellies touching. \"G-goodnight, Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Claire,\" Elizabeth smiled, closing her eyes as she slowly put her hand over Claire's. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Claire slept, she dreamed she was sitting in a pool. No, she wasn't sitting. She was resting against the edge, letting her body float as best it could with her enormous belly as she pushed and panted. Claire was totally naked, her belly unbelievably large and tight as she pushed, the sounds of encouragement slowly growing around her until they were so loud, she didn't know how she missed them in the first place. Brad and Brittany were on one side of her, coaching their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Mom, you're almost there,\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby #1 is close to crowning,\" Brittany smiled. \"Only seven more to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Claire's other side, all of Elizabeth's children were giving her the same encouragement. Christine and Monica were massaging Claire's shoulders and Roy and Veronica held her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squeeze, Mom. Get it all out,\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Claire said in a daze, her body exhausted. \"I'm not your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both their moms now,\" Elizabeth said, swimming toward Claire, her belly just as big. Elizabeth traced a wet hand over Claire's massive, smooth middle. \"I'm here for you, Claire. Push before I go into labor too. I feel it coming on soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded and grit her teeth, getting ready for one big push when another voice came from somewhere in the void of her dreamspace. \"Claire? Claire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad Sr. rushed in, looking Claire in the eye. \"B-Brad? Why are you here?\" Claire mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire? How could you do this to me? What about our children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Claire said, patting her enormous belly. \"Our children are right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about these children?\" Brad Sr. said, revealing his own belly to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire jolted awake, a cold sweat all over her body as she panted quickly. Her dreams were getting stranger and stranger, but Claire knew she couldn't just ignore them anymore. A few days ago, she dreamed that she and Elizabeth would be hugely pregnant and now, well...Claire put her hands on her own belly, nearly twice as large as it had been yesterday when she looked about eight months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Claire?\" Elizabeth's voice said. Claire was still a bit foggy from sleep and the bedroom was dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Elizabeth?\" Claire said sweetly, imagining the caring Elizabeth from her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...pushing me off the bed.\" Claire blinked her eyes a few time to see that Elizabeth was on the edge of the bed, Claire's belly pushing her away. Elizabeth had grown, just as Claire had, to enormous proportions and the bed that once held Claire and her husband with room to spare was too small for the two pregnant friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" Claire said, shifting awkwardly to get her belly away from Elizabeth's and to reach out to pull her friend back onto the bed. \"I guess our hypotheses that we'd get better ended up being...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly right,\" Elizabeth sighed with a smile, heaving her swollen body up to sit up in bed next to Claire. \"I've never been pregnant with octuplets before, but I feel like this is not how it's supposed to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Claire sighed, rubbing her belly alongside Elizabeth's, looking between the two of theirs. She still couldn't help feeling that Elizabeth looked much better pregnant than she did. She was taller, smoother, tighter; all-around sexier. Elizabeth, on the other hand, looked over Claire's pregnant body, finding her friend as caring and beautiful as she was in Elizabeth's recent pregnant dreams. Elizabeth had been alone for a long time and having someone like Claire with her during this trying time was...nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having someone in bed with me, even if it was just a friend, was...\" Elizabeth began, turning to face Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Claire said, blushing as she got closer to Elizabeth as well. \"It was...special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their faces got closer and their minds went blank, the bedroom door opened with a slam. \"Mom! It...it got bigger again!\" Brittany said, belly jutting out of her pajamas. \"O-oh, sorry...I didn't know Elizabeth was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Claire smiled, moving slowly to get off of the bed. \"You're not the only one who got bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany looked over Claire and Elizabeth with shocked looks. It was surprising enough that the two women woke up sporting massive pregnant bellies yesterday, but now they each looked like they were carrying a beach ball in their wombs. \"Mom...what is going on?\" Brittany said, giving Claire a frightened hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, sweetie, but we'll be okay,\" Claire said, petting Brittany's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all the-\" Brad Jr. said, rubbing his eyes and walking into the bedroom, where he was greeted by the half-naked, enormously pregnant body of Elizabeth Dawson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled and gave Brad a little wave. \"It happened again, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad's eyes moved from Elizabeth's belly to her heaving chest to her face right back to her belly a few dozen times before he responded. \"Y-yeah, I guess so.\" He gulped. \"How many more times do you think it'll happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know,\" Claire sighed, releasing her hug with her daughter to stroke her belly. \"Maybe it'll continue until we're 'full term,' maybe we'll just keep getting more and more pregnant forever. I don't think this there's any precedence for this sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one thing's for sure,\" Elizabeth chuckled, hands on her belly. \"We're definitely pregnant.\" She reached over to Claire and took her hand, pressing it against the side of her belly. \"Do you feel it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gasped, face turning red. \"Kicking. Lots and lots of kicking and moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight little Dawsons,\" Elizabeth said, shaking her head and laughing quietly. \"It's really happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad felt his head about to explode. Both of them. He rushed back to his room and closed the door, taking in deep breaths. His fetish for pregnant women was starting to be a blessing and a curse. His mind was racing, his heart was pounding, and all he wanted to do was run back out and wrap his arms around Elizabeth. <i>But if she's bigger...so are Monica and Christine</i>! Brad thought, which only moved his mind from Elizabeth to some other women. And at that moment, Brad grabbed his box of tissues and headed for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was unusually peppy, given the current events, as Claire, her kids, and Elizabeth ate breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you didn't have to make me breakfast,\" Elizabeth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a friend and a guest in the house. Besides, you need something to eat before you go to work,\" Claire said. Elizabeth could still fit into her work pants, but she had to make the decision to open up the bottom half of her shirt to let her belly out. Carol and the customers were just going to have to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can drive you to your restaurant,\" Brad said, Bella between him and Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear,\" Elizabeth smiled sweetly, which only made Brad's heart beat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you all be going to the doctor again?\" Bella said. \"This can't be normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't,\" Claire nodded. \"But something like this...I don't know if the doctor can help. We'll wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy,\" Bella repeated to herself, again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we...due soon?\" Brittany asked, one hand on her belly as she ate her toast and eggs. She now looked full-term with one baby. \"I feel so big and tight. Any more and I feel like I'll burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, that's how I felt with all three of you when I was only seven months pregnant,\" Claire laughed, shaking her head. \"And according to the doctor, you're carrying triplets, so I think you still have a ways to go. Besides,\" Claire said, taking a step back and looking down at her own bare belly, apron clumsily resting on top, \"clearly, it's possible to get bigger.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since Brad was busy taking Elizabeth to work, Roy, Veronica and Brittany headed to school together.  They headed to health class, where Principal Decker was waiting.  The three pregnant teens took a seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked over at Kat, and though it was clear that she was much larger, it was evident that she had given up trying to look presentable.  She wore sweatpants and a t-shirt that was much to small for her gargantuan belly.  In addition, her hair was a mess.  Kat was face-first in food, obviously making the most of the snack machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, class.  I know that I'm not a teacher, but since Mr. Franklin here knows next to nothing about pregnancy, I have decided to teach the class for the time being.\" Principal Decker said, hand wrapping the underside of her belly that was protruding from her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Franklin stood at the back of the room and scoffed, his arms crossed over his belly, which was just beginning to show.  \"On a side note, Mr. Franklin is just having one baby, lucky for him, but I am having triplets.  I know that there are some students that are expecting more, so I will not force you all to reveal the number of babies you are having.\" she smiled reassuringly.  She then turned on the projector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the class, a documentary on pregnancy played.  While most of the class watched with dull interest, Brittany was extremely interested.  Her eyes were glued to the bellies displayed on screen.  Towards the end of the video, she felt a light fluttering coming from her belly.  She gasped, and her hand immediately shot to her rounding midsection.  She felt around for more movement, but it had passed.  Suddenly, the bell rang, and the the class heaved themselves from their chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, all but Kat.  She tried and tried, but it had appeared that her belly had gotten stuck.  Roy noticed this, and approached her.  \"Do you need help?\" he asked as politely as he could, but he had to admit that it was pretty comical.  \"I...yeah.  Please.\"  Kat replied.  Roy grabbed her arm, and pulled her up, surprised at how much she weighed.  After a strong tug, he was able to get her free.  \"Whew, thank you...\"she trailed, forgetting his name.  \"Roy...\"he finished.  \"Roy.  Right, thanks.  I guess you're my knight in shining armor.  So that makes me you're disgustingly pregnant damsel in distress.\" she smirked, giving her belly a light slap for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could be worse.  My mom is having octuplets.\" he noted.  \"Oh, wow.  That's...wow...\" Kat said.  \"Hey, I know I just met you and all but...do you wanna...get dinner tonight?\" she asked.  Roy gasped.  He was shocked that she was relatively interested in him.  \"Yeah, sure...\" he replied.  \"And I know that I'll probably rack up the dinner bill because I'm eating for seven and all, but I can pay for it.\"  she said.  \"No.  No, no, no.  I'll pay for it for sure.\"  Roy answered.  \"You'd really do that?\" she asked, wincing slightly as she felt a particularly strong kick.  \"Anything for my damsel in distress.\" he joked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  It'll be nice to talk to someone who isn't pregnant.\" she smiled as she waddled out of the classroom.  Roy frowned, finding it odd that she didn't realize that he was pregnant as well.  It was true that he was much smaller than Kat, but he had a decent sized belly.  He left the classroom, happy that he was getting somewhere with Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the classes were much more different now, as they all became pregnancy related.  In history class, Mr. Greenly discussed the history of abnormal pregnancies, from immaculate conceptions to supposed alien abductions.  Throughout the class, Mr. Greenly rubbed his small bump, as it was clear that he was happy with his pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Tanner was a different story.  The class was ordered to read \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\", which angered her, as she thought it was a waste of time.  As she passed the books out, her large quadruplet filled belly bumped into desks, knocking over classroom items.  Frustrated, she took a seat.  Since she was still unaccustomed to her belly, it was propped awkwardly on top of her desk.  She groaned, and rolled her chair backwards, as her belly plopped on her lap heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince advanced chemistry was completely unrelated to pregnancy, Ms. Flora was able to continue with her lesson plan.  She wore a blouse, only buttoned over her breasts, leaving her sextuplet belly exposed, popped-out navel and all.  Ms. Flora was busy discussing ionic and covalent bonds, when her stomach released a massive growl.  \"Ooh!  Short little biology lesson,\" she said as she waddled to her desk,\"the more pregnant you are, the more hungry you get.\" she said.  Ms. Flora grabbed some food and began to eat, taking the rest of the class to eat.  As the bell rang, Brittany approached Ms. Flora, who was finishing her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Brittany.  I've done some more research on the Xpect...\"she trailed.  \"And?\" Brittany asked, placing a hand on her own large belly.  \"Somehow, someway, it's made everyone who drinks it pregnant.\" she answered.  \"Just like you thought...\"Brittany noted.  \"Exactly!  I'll need to do a little more research on it do determine HOW it works, however.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany stared at Ms. Flora's large belly, as she watched the visible kicks and punches roll across the surface of her skin.  A particularly strong kick forced her to let out a grunt.  \"Ugh!  These babies are gonna be soccer players!\" she giggled.  \"Wanna feel?\" she asked.  \"Sure...\" Brittany replied, not wanting to sound too excited.  Brittany thought it was incredible, feeling every kick.  \"Have you felt any movement yet?\"  Ms. Flora asked.  \"No, not yet.  Soon I hope.\" she said, rubbing her belly.  \"Alright, I think I should get back to my research.  I'll call you if there's anything significant in my findings.\" Ms. Flora said.  \"Alright.  See you...Renee.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brittany waddled ever so slightly out of the school, catching up with Roy and Veronica.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elizabeth walked into work cautiously, looking for Carol, her boss. In the absence of fitting work clothes, Elizabeth got the largest shirt she could and unbuttoned the front, her bare belly hanging out. Well, maybe not hanging out. Elizabeth easily had the largest pregnant belly anyone in the restaurant had seen before, but she was still only five months pregnant. Her octuplet belly was a long way from dropping. Elizabeth clocked in as she rubbed her belly, getting a tap on the shoulder from Joann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I was shocked yesterday when I heard you were carrying eight, but now I can really see it,\" Joann chuckled, eyes glued to Elizabeth's belly. Joann's own belly was easy to see as her shirt clung tightly to her roundness. \"Should you really be at work? I'd think the doctors would have you on round-the-clock monitoring and bed rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine,\" Elizabeth shrugged, smiling back at Joann. \"I mean, I get a little tired carrying this load around, but otherwise I feel okay.\" Elizabeth paused, looking down at her belly, bumping against Joann's. \"Honestly, I have this weird feeling that I'll carry these eight to full term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoann let out a long sigh. \"We might not be able to fit you in here if you end up that big,\" she laughed, resting a hand on Elizabeth's bare bump. \"But you carry it so well. Look at me. I just look like a knocked up country girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with that look,\" Elizabeth grinned, pressing her belly harder against Joann's. Joann's cheeks were looking as full and rosy as always, her skin and hair shimmering, and her already-large breasts looked like they were about to get wider than her belly. Elizabeth turned a few degrees to rub Joann's belly warmly, her smile turning more predatory as she moved her hand toward her co-worker's chest. Joann's face turned red but she didn't resist, letting her hands open up on Elizabeth's belly. As Elizabeth stroked, her mind started to drift until it wasn't Joann she was caressing; it was Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Elizabeth,\" Joann said softly, snapping Elizabeth back into reality. Her face turned bright red and she straightened out her shirt and maternity pants, clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so is Carol in today?\" Elizabeth asked, turning around to put her purse away, unaware that her pregnancy had made her ass much larger too, nearly knocking Joann with her rear. \"She'll probably freak out on me with my shirt like this, but nothing else will fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's here, but...\" Joann laughed quietly as she saw their manager walking from the back offices to the front of the restaurant, \"I don't think she'll be in any position to criticize your clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned to see Carol checking the bar's register, her clothes clearly too small for her. As she came behind the bar, Elizabeth could see why: her belly had grown and was straining the conservative clothing she usually wore. Carol's eyes met Elizabeth's and she looked away, clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth,\" Carol said in direct tone, walking over, looking her employee over a few times. \"I assume you'll be able to keep that big bump clean at work today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Elizabeth nodded. Carol kept her eyes on Elizabeth's belly. Joann was also having a hard time looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you won't use your lack of dress to find a new baby daddy among our customers?\" Carol asked, looking at Elizabeth angrily. Elizabeth chuckled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am. I'm prepared to be just as professional, even if I'm pregnant,\" Elizabeth said, placing both hands on the front of her belly, rubbing up and down. \"After all, Joann manages to do just fine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmph,\" Carol complained, waddling awkwardly to the back. Joann laughed and gave Elizabeth a little hug across her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew you could get her back,\" Joann giggled. \"Who knew it would take you getting pregnant to make her shut up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm like a protective mama bear,\" Elizabeth smiled, patting her belly. \"I look big enough to start hibernating, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hush, you look great,\" Joann said, tossing her blond hair. \"Now c'mon: customers are coming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's shift went even better than she expected. Everyone was happy to see her, she was courteous and funny, and she was making great tips. One big party of guys seemed especially happy to see her, cheering whenever she came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My buddy was right: this place is great! Two hot pregnant waitresses!\" one guy said, high-fiving a friend. Elizabeth blushed and tossed her long hair, putting one hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew I was pregnant before you came in?\" Elizabeth said, trying to sound cool but really just mining for information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of ours was here yesterday and I guess he saw you,\" another guy said, smiling as he looked Elizabeth over a few times, eyes mainly on her belly. \"But I had no idea there was another pregnant girl here. Honestly, she's more my type, but she's nowhere near as big as you, which counts in your favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth blushed and gave a little smile back. \"Well, I love to get compliments,\" she said, turning away slowly, hoping it would help her with tips. Elizabeth could have guessed that there were people out there who liked pregnant women \u2014 certainly not her ex-husband \u2014 but it wasn't something she'd been thinking about. Then it crossed her mind...did Claire feel that way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was back at her own house, doing the work of a stay-at-home mom. She'd been used to doing chores pregnant, but never <u>this</u> pregnant. Vacuuming is hard when you can't see your feet, let alone the bottom of the vacuum, so Claire only did a few passes around the living room, not expecting she did much of a job. Wiping off the counters in the kitchen, Claire had to bend awkwardly, as her belly kept bumping against the counter. And, every now and then, Claire would feel a fluttering inside her, which meant she had to stop and feel her belly, trying to see if she could feel her future children moving inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning the entire five-person house (something that Claire constantly thought about with fear when considering adding eight more people to the family) was exhausting enough, but with Claire's belly in the mix, she was covered in sweat. But it didn't ruin the clothing Claire and Elizabeth had bought for their expanding selves. With the kids out of the house and the size of her pregnant body, Claire opted to clean the house in just her bra and underwear, which were each hard enough to get on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed and took a long drink of water from the fridge as she rubbed her belly, taking pride in her ability to do all that housework, even with her belly. \"I'm pregnant, barefoot, and cleaning the house,\" Claire laughed, shaking her head. \"Not exactly a symbol of women's progress, but I'm happy with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by a mirror, Claire paused and looked herself over, blushing. She was so...big. The only way to feel the front of her belly was to stretch her arms out to their maximum extension and she was getting pretty wide across. She hoped she still didn't \"look pregnant\" from behind, but she had a feel that soon, that would be impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's phone buzzed and she looked down to see a text from Elizabeth. &lt;working with a belly's hard huh?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled and texted back &lt;haha yeah&gt; before a strange thought entered her head. Claire turned to her mirror and snapped a picture of her pregnant, half-naked body and sent it to Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she regretted the decision. Her whole face burned bright red and she wanted to hide her face. She sent a sexy picture (she hoped it was sexy, at least, but her self-esteem was fluctuated wildly, thanks to her hormones) to her next-door neighbor and friend. How long had it been since she even sent a picture to her husband? Had she <u>ever</u> texted a picture like that to Brad Sr.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire didn't wait to see what Elizabeth texted back and hurried to the living room, turning on the TV to try and relax, one hand resting on her belly as she let her body unwind, eventually falling asleep on the couch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After school let out, Roy dropped Brittany off at her house, and he and Veronica returned home.  Brittany headed inside, unaware of her hugely pregnant mother sleeping on the couch, and went in her bedroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, she observed her gravid state.  She rolled her shirt up, and gazed at her round stomach, both hands rubbing it gently.  \"Pregnant with triplets, I can't believe it...\" she whispered to herself.  She had always dreamed of being pregnant, and she was delighted that the day actually came.  Brittany pushed her stomach out in an attempt to make it look bigger, but she was already pretty big.  More flutters of movement came, which made Brittany gasp even louder than she did earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire woke up on the couch groggily, wondering where she was.  After realizing that she was on the couch, she heaved herself from the couch, completely unaware of the news story covering the city's \"Pregnancy Epidemic\" that was being displayed on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Claire got upright, Brad walked in after just dropping off Elizabeth at her house.  The first thing he saw as he entered the house was his half-naked mother in all her pregnant glory.  \"Hey, Sweetie!  How was school?\" she asked, pushing her back in an attempt to stretch, which further accentuated her big bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD.\" Brad replied, hurrying to his room before he exploded.  He made it in time, and was able to stop himself from \"erupting\".  He sat down, letting out a deep sigh.  \"Shit.\" he said.  A light fluttering then emanated from his decent sized belly.  \"Double shit.\"  He needed someone to talk to, someone who was going through what he was going through.  He needed Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad headed over to the Dawson household.  He rang the doorbell, and was greeted by Elizabeth, still wearing her too-small work clothes.  \"Hi, Brad!  Does your mother need something?\" she asked, a tinge of desperation in her voice.  \"Um, no.  But is Monica here?\" he replied.  \"Oh...yes, she is.  I'll go get her.\" she said, waddling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Monica came to the doorway, donning yoga pants and an athletic shirt, which didn't do a great job of covering her belly, which made her look overdue.  \"Hey!\" she smiled.  \"Hey.  Listen, you're pregnant--and, well, I'm pregnant, too--we're both pregnant, and I know how important exercising during pregnancy is, so I thought maybe we could go for a walk and talk a little bit?\" he said, sounding all too nervous.  \"Actually, I was just about to go for a walk, so sure!\" she said, flashing him a smile.  \"Oh...oh, great!\" Brad sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked, they both talked, about life, pregnancy, and anything in between.  Suddenly, Monica stopped.  \"Oh, god, they're kicking!\" she exclaimed.  \"Do you wanna feel?\" she asked Brad.  \"YES!\" he said, with as much enthusiasm as Monica.  He began to rub her belly with gusto, feeling the jabs and kicks underneath her swollen skin.  After a brief amount of time, he began to feel \"excited\" again.  \"Uh, I gotta go!\" he yelled, running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad?  Brad!\" Monica yelled, trying to stop him.  \"Hmph.  Oh, well.  I guess it's just me and you.\" she said to her round stomach.  \"And you.  And you.  And you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy drove to the address that Kat gave him, as he was ready to go on their date.  He had put on a button up shirt, as he didn't want to look like a slob, but at the same time didn't want to look too fancy.  It displayed his rounded stomach, but he didn't care.  It wasn't like he was the only pregnant guy, anyway.  As soon as he pulled up to her house, Kat came out.  She wore a bright orange sundress, which was stretched tight across her swollen midsection.  Roy moved the passenger seat back as far as he could, so she would not get stuck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the car door and took a seat.  \"Thanks for picking me up.\" Kat said.  \"My pleasure.\" he responded, turning the Charm Meter to 11.  \"Can we go to The Olive Branch?  I've been craving pizza.\" she said, rubbing her belly.  \"If that's what you want, that's what you'll get.\" Roy said, as he drove off to is mother's workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at The Olive Branch, Roy escorted his pregnant date inside.  They took a seat at the nearest table.  Joann approached them, looking to take their order.  \"Hey, y'all.  My name is Joann and I'll be your waitress tonight.  Hey, are you one of Elizabeth's kids?\" she asked Roy.  \"Yep.\" Roy acknowledged.  \"Oh, well in that case, you two get a 20% discount for tonight's meal.  It looks like you'll need it.  Trust me, I do.\" she chuckled, patting her pregnant belly for emphasis.  She took their drink orders and headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joann prepared their drinks, she walked over to Carol.  \"I've had the worst indigestion today!  It's almost as if there's something...moving around in there!\" she scowled to Joann as she placed a hand on her slightly rounded middle.  \"Carol, have you ever thought that maybe, I don't know, you're pregnant?\" she said as she approached her boss, placing one hand on Carol's middle, feeling the tightness of it.  \"No!  And shame on you for assuming that!  My husband and I haven't had sex in over a year!\" she yelled.  \"Oh, well that's...sad.\" Joann trailed, uttering that last word underneath her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoann returned to Roy and Kat's table with drinks and bread.  Before Roy could even grab one slice of bread, Kat had already eaten half of it.  \"Alright, what would you like for y'all's meals?\" Joan asked.  \"I'll have an extra large meat-lover's pizza.\" Kat said.  \"I'll just have the meatball parm.\" Roy said, kind of surprised at his date's appetite.  After some small talk, their meals had arrived.  Kat devoured her pizza at a rapid pace, and Roy ate his meal quickly as well.  Within ten minutes, they had finished their meals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, any room for dessert?\" Joann asked.  \"Nah, I'm pretty full...\" Roy said.  \"I'll have a cannoli.\" Kat blurted.  Her massive stomach growled.  \"Actually, make that six.\" she added.  After dessert came and went, Kat was regretting her decision.  \"I shouldn't have done that...\" she groaned.  \"Hey, don't worry about it, we all get cravings.\" Roy reassured.  \"Yeah, but mainly only when you're pregnant.  Wait, are you pregnant?\" she asked.  \"Yeah...I am.  I'm having twins.\" he said.  \"Oh...that's...\" Kat trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Roy asked.  \"No it's just...it's fine.\" she Kat said.  After that awkward conversation, the two left the restaurant, and Roy took Kat home.  \"Look, despite what happened earlier, I had a great time.  I really did.\" she said.  \"Yeah?  I did too.\" Roy responded.  \"Alright, well I'll see you on Monday?\" she asked.  \"Always.\" he replied.  \"Okay, good night.\" Kat said, giving Roy a peck on the cheek.  Roy blushed as he watched her waddle into her house, and he drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at Ms. Flora's house, she was indulging on her own pregnancy cravings, all the while continuing to research the Xpect.  \"I just don't get it!  It's absolutely mind-boggling.\" she said, rubbing her belly where a particularly strong kick was felt.  Suddenly, the clock struck midnight.  Her belly surged forward, growing until she looked much larger.  \"What the...wait a minute.  I get bigger when each new day starts?\" she asked herself.  \"I might be onto something here...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elizabeth had just heaved herself out of her car when she got the text from Claire. Driving was getting increasingly difficult for Elizabeth, given how she looked overdue with triplets, despite only being five months pregnant. She knew she'd have to start taking the bus soon or get a ride from Joann. Then again, soon Joann wouldn't be able to drive her either, since she was pregnant with triplets. Yesterday Joann said she was only five months pregnant but...Elizabeth suspected something wasn't quite right about these pregnancy estimates. After all, yesterday a doctor told her she was four months pregnant and one look at her belly would tell anyone that Elizabeth was more than four months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the text up and saw the attached picture of a half-naked, hugely pregnant Claire, Elizabeth was stopped dead in her tracks. Claire was absolutely gorgeous. And what did it mean that she sent this to Elizabeth? Was she feeling the same things that Elizabeth was? Her heart began to flutter, which led to more kicking inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, okay, let's get inside before we think anymore about this,\" Elizabeth groaned, wrapped one arm around her belly as she hurried inside as best she could, given her size. Changing out of her work uniform, Elizabeth was tempted to text Claire back an equally revealing photo of her own pregnant body in her underwear...a temptation she gave into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore kicks churned around in Elizabeth's womb and sent her quickly to the bathroom, where her cheeks burned red. \"Should I have done that?\" she said to herself. \"Maybe I should...stop by soon and she how Claire took it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext door, Claire was straining to get dressed again, eventually stopping with a huff as she looked at herself in the mirror. Her sweatpants and shirt were stretched as far as they could, but no luck. A wide sliver of Claire's bare belly was still on display and her ill-fitting clothes actually had a way of \"framing\" her popped-out belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is sort of a cute look,\" Claire sighed, turning around to get a better look at herself, pausing when she saw how her sweatpants showed off her butt's size in the reflection. \"Maybe not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard her door slowly open and clumsily turned around to see Brittany in the doorway, looking her mother over. Claire smiled and waddled a few steps over to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Brittany sweetie,\" Claire said, stroking her belly. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to feel...uncomfortable,\" Brittany said softly, holding her hands around her belly. \"It's really heavy and it feels so tight already. Is that normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet it is,\" Claire laughed softly, getting close enough to her daughter to place her hands on Brittany's belly. She was five months pregnant with triplets, so Brittany was unusually large, but still utterly dwarfed by Claire. Brittany also managed to cover up her entire pregnant belly with her clothes, but once Claire got her hands on her daughter's bulge, the bare belly was out. \"Here, let me get something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can make it go away?\" Brittany asked. As fascinated with pregnancy as she was, Brittany was still extremely naive about what the experience of <u>being</u> pregnant was really like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire chuckled. \"Well, I can't do anything about the heaviness. I expect that problem's going to get worse. Same with the tightness, although this cocoa butter might make you feel better.\" Claire waddled into her own bathroom, rummaging around for it. \"I still have a tub left over from when I was pregnant with Bella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire looked around in the other room, Brittany saw Claire's phone buzz and, curious, picked it up. It was a text from Elizabeth, and opening it up, Brittany was treated to a half-naked, pregnant photo of Elizabeth. More than just half-naked: Elizabeth had taken her bra off and was holding one arm around her breasts to cover her nipples while her other hand snapped the photograph in her closet's mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Elizabeth's already beautiful features were further accentuated by her pregnancy: her dark skin was even smoother and had a gentle glow, her long almond hair was silkier and wavier, her chest and hips (and, although it wasn't clear from the photo, her ass) had all gotten larger and more inviting, her model's face had an added look of confidence and mischief, and, of course, she was sporting a huge, round pregnant belly. Brittany felt her body freeze as she looked at the photo, unable to look away until she heard Claire coming back out of the bathroom. She exited out of the \"messages\" and tossed the phone back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was wincing and rubbing her belly as she waddled back out. \"Bumped into the wall on my way out. That small bathroom was clearly not designed for a woman pregnant with octuplets.\" Opening up the tub of cocoa butter, Claire got out a scoop and rolled up Brittany's shirt, rubbing the cream in circles all over her belly. \"There, better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-better,\" Brittany said, heard beating quickly. The doorbell rang and Brittany took a few quick steps back. \"I-I'll get it, don't worry.\" Brittany made her way downstairs, meeting Brad on the way down. Both opened the door, only to see Elizabeth, belly just as exposed as Claire's, waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Elizabeth smiled, sending shivers down Brad and Brittany's spines. \"Is your mother here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" the Perkins children warbled, getting out of the way as Elizabeth slowly moved inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to run away from me so quickly,\" she chuckled, resting a hand on her hugeness. \"Getting this pregnant isn't infectious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids laughed nervously as Claire made her way downstairs, moving much more slowly than her daughter. \"Elizabeth,\" Claire said, smiling. \"Nice to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too,\" Elizabeth smiled eagerly, making her way to Claire. \"I was thinking we could have dinner together...\" She made her way closer to Claire. \"The two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, not getting Elizabeth's second text, thought she wanted to confront Claire over the lewd photo she'd sent Elizabeth. Bella made her way down the stairs and looked around as Claire got out her wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids, why don't you all go out to dinner tonight,\" Claire said, getting out some money and handing it to her only non-pregnant daughter. \"You don't spend any time together anymore. \"C'mon, have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Bella said, rolling her eyes. \"You two aren't going to pig out with cravings and embarrass me, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Brittany said, blushing as she looked over at Elizabeth. When the door closed, Claire and Elizabeth moved slowly to the kitchen as Claire started to unload leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how was your day?\" Elizabeth asked, a tiny grin forming on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Boring,\" Claire replied, blushing as she saw Elizabeth's smile. It was so cute while being so...intimidating. \"Just cleaning the house with about 20 pounds of pregnant belly in my way. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly the same,\" Elizabeth chuckled, eating alongside her friend. As the meal wore down, Elizabeth moved a little closer to Claire. \"You know, I...got your photo today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you did?\" Claire said, wincing. \"I'm s-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very beautiful,\" Elizabeth said. \"Pregnant, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Claire said, looking Elizabeth over. \"So do you...much more so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth and Claire giggled nervously, each looking away, then at each other's eyes, then each other's bellies. \"I've had a lot of compliments and flirting since my husband left but none of them have felt as...real as what you say to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gulped. \"W-well, I mean it. And when you tell me I'm beautiful, I feel so much more...confident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are beautiful,\" Elizabeth said, moving her hand to Claire's belly. \"You've always been beautiful, but lately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way about you,\" Claire breathed, putting her hand on Elizabeth's bulge. Their gentle fingertips sent shivers down both their spines as the neighbors leaned in, kissing for a few seconds before looking back at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we go from here?\" Elizabeth said after a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long pause. \"My bedroom,\" Claire said, leaning in for another kiss, barely brushing Elizabeth's upper lip. Taking each other's hands, the two octomoms heaved their gigantic, pregnant bodies up to Claire's bedroom and undressed, tracing their bodies with their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so strange like this,\" Claire said, moving Elizabeth's hand to her belly. \"I'm so big...everywhere. It's nothing like the other times I've been pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look perfect,\" Elizabeth said, kissing Claire's neck, then her lips, as her other hand traced Claire's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire ran her hands through Elizabeth's soft hair, kissing her on the forehead and cheeks. \"So...do we just cuddle or should we go all the way with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends,\" Elizabeth said, looking up at Claire. \"How do you feel about me? In your heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire didn't need long to think about it. \"I love you, Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Claire,\" Elizabeth said, moving her lips to Claire's belly. \"Have you ever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While pregnant or with another woman?\" Claire grinned. \"Yes to the first one, no to the second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same,\" Elizabeth said, making it past Claire's huge belly to her lap. \"But cumming while pregnant feels...unreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've missed it,\" Claire panted, spreading her legs, gripping her breasts. \"Remind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wore out pretty quickly, thanks to their belly sizes, but Claire and Elizabeth were well within the throes of passion for the rest of the night as they held each other as closely as they could, thanks to their bellies, placing errant kisses all over their bodies.</span></div></div>",

Her face was pressed deeply into Elizabeth's cleavage. \"You've gotten bigger again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you,\" Elizabeth smiled, moving one hand down to Claire's belly. Claire looked down at the two of them. Six month pregnant with eight fetuses apiece and they were both as gigantic as you'd expect. \"We'll need a bigger bed if we want to keep doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bigger bed,\" Claire chuckled back, before opening her eyes widely and pulling quickly away from Elizabeth's chest. \"Oh my god...oh my god...we had sex last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did,\" Elizabeth smiled back, reaching one arm over to Claire's belly. Claire struggled to sit up, the weight and size of her new pregnant body slowing her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Elizabeth, I...I cheated on Brad with you! My husband! The father of my children...\" Claire rested her hands on her monstrous belly. \"Well, not these children, but still! I shouldn't have done this, I'm sorry.\" Claire tried to heave herself out of bed, slowly letting her body roll toward the edge so she could step down. Elizabeth, still lying naked on her side, moved over and put her hands around Claire's hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, wait...I'm not sorry we did it. I really do love you and I haven't been able to feel this way in so, so long.\" Elizabeth sat up, wrapping her arms around Claire's belly as best she could without her own belly getting in the way. \"You love me too, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turned around and looked at Elizabeth's face: her deep black eyes, her glowing brown skin, her full lips, her luxurious hair, falling playfully over her face. \"Of course I do,\" Claire whimpered, \"but I love my husband too...and I already made a commitment to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth hesitated before letting go of Claire. \"I understand...I wish I could say one night with you was enough but...\" Elizabeth kissed Claire on the cheek instead of continuing her thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never forget it,\" Claire said, on the verge of tears. \"I'll never forget what it felt like to be totally loved by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two super expectant mothers hugged, bending awkwardly because their bellies kept them apart. Even as they hugged in their modified pose, their breasts pressed together and put nearly three feet between them. Their nipples touched and Claire and Elizabeth both shuddered, both believing this would be their last intimate contact together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire let Elizabeth use her shower and borrow some of her maternity clothes, which were quickly becoming as useless for covering up her pregnant body as regular clothes. The long, stretchy dress Claire bought now only covered three-fourths of her belly, allowing for a big, obvious underbelly. The accompanying skirt was hiked up a few inches thanks to her rear taking up so much space and her breasts were so big, the previously conservative collar of her dress was now stretched out to almost look like a v-neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The women at the book club will get a kick out of this,\" Claire sighed, looking herself over as Elizabeth pulled up her own pants with great effort.  Claire gasped.  \"Oh, no!  My friend Susan is having her baby shower today!  I haven't told her about this yet!\" she yelled, trying to wrap her hands around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me: you look great.  I'll go with you after my shift so you won't have to go through it alone.\" Elizabeth smiled. Claire blushed and grinned, looking back down at her belly. \"What will we tell your kids when we come downstairs together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out,\" Claire said, waddling slowly down the stairs to the kitchen, where the three Perkins children were already waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth?\" Brad Jr. and Brittany both said in unison, faces turning pale as they saw plenty of her belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, oh my god!\" Bella said, gawking at her mother. \"Look at how huge you are now! You can't go outside like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm perfectly fine,\" Claire said, glaring back at her youngest daughter. \"This is all a natural part of life and I refuse to be embarrassed about my body while it's going through the miracle of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't believe that crap,\" Bella said. \"You've been trying to cover up your belly for the last week. You just ran out of fitting clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe you'd like you accompany your mother to the mall and help her shop for maternity clothes,\" Elizabeth giggled. \"I'm sure you'd both love that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella groaned and returned to her breakfast. Brad and Brittany's eyes were still fixed on Elizabeth. \"We didn't hear you come in,\" Brittany said nervously. \"Have you been here all night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was up last night chatting with your mother and, as I'm sure you know, pregnancy can be very tiring,\" Elizabeth sighed, patting the top of her belly. \"So I just slept here last night. I'm sure my kids loved not having me referee their fights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany couldn't stop thinking of Elizabeth as she looked in the photo on Claire's phone: pregnant, naked, sultry. Did her mother send Elizabeth the same sorts of pictures? Brittany felt herself blush more as she pictured Claire, full-term with octuplets and posing in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, we'd better get you both to school,\" Brad said, putting his plates away as he grabbed his car keys. \"Need me to pick anything up, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm fine, Brad,\" Claire smiled. \"See you tonight for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Brad said, walking with his sisters to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping them off at school, Brad walked into the coffee shop across the street from the high school for a smoothie. The pamphlets the Perkins and Dawson families had gotten at the OB/GYN's office said that pregnant women shouldn't drink coffee or soda, and even though he was a pregnant man, Brad thought he should pick healthier drinks too and got a smoothie. After getting his drink, he saw Monica sitting at a table by herself. \"H-hey,\" he said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she smiled back. He sat down and moved his drink out of the way. \"Did you just drop off your little siblings too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brad smiled, clearing his throat. \"L-look, I know things are crazy now and these aren't the best circumstances, but...I've really enjoyed spending time with you lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...kay?\" Monica replied, smiling while raising a confused eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah and I was hoping you'd like to make what we have more...official, you know?\" Brad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad?\" Brad turned his head to see Christine walking up to the table, drink in hand. Only...she was Monica, not Christine. And he hadn't been talking to Monica...it was Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better go,\" Christine said, moving away from the table as Monica looked at Brad in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't tell us apart?\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, you're twins and you're both so good looking and have the same size bellies,\" Brad began before feeling a hard slap across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'd like to see you anymore,\" Monica said quietly, marching out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed, looking down at his own belly, which was starting to look less like fat and more like a pregnant bulge. \"I know you're twins too, but I hope you turn out a little different,\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn school, Brittany was finishing up her chemistry class when Ms. Flora stopped her. \"Brittany, I think I made some more progress with studying Xpect. For one, it definitely is causing pregnancy. Yours, mine, everyone's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell why? I mean...a drink that causes pregnancy. That's crazy,\" Brittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found some very bizarre molecular structures that I've isolated and pinpointed as the cause,\" Ms. Flora nodded. \"I may even be able to replicate them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Replicate them?\" Brittany gulped. \"I don't think there should be any more Xpect in the world. It's caused enough trouble already. My brother's pregnant and my mom is...\" Brittany looked down at her own big belly. She was petite compared to Claire, but Brittany was still six months pregnant with triplets and it showed. \"Really, really pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Flora bit her lip, her nipples hardening. \"How pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octuplets,\" Brittany winced. \"But she's very strong about it. She's even started going to a book club, despite being...well...you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've got a very impressive mother,\" Ms. Flora smiled. \"It's hard enough for me with six babies in here. We'll talk more about this project soon, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, have a nice day, Renee,\" Brittany smiled as she left the classroom, looking back at Ms. Flora quickly. She wasn't as big as Elizabeth or her mother, but Ms. Flora let her bare belly hang out of her coat and had a sexy, flirty attitude. It was the opposite of Claire and Elizabeth's \"motherly\" pregnant persona and it attracted Brittany strongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as Brittany left, Ms. Flora headed into her own private lab and locked the door. Undoing the buttons on her lab coat, Ms. Flora dropped it to the floor, her naked, pregnant body underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octuplets,\" she cackled to herself, \"that's perfect. I was just going to use my own belly or that student Kat's, but octuplets is even better!\" Ms. Flora booted up her diagnostic computer with one hand while she squirted cocoa butter into her other. The walls of her lab were covered in pictures of pregnant women. Some were strictly medical, but most were glamour shots of enormous women in skimpy clothing or no clothing at all. Pictures of Ms. Flora were frequently included among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Flora typed and entered data with one hand while she rubbed cream over her huge belly with the other. \"Yes, using a woman with as much pregnant energy as Mrs. Perkins will produce a much stronger batch of Xpect for myself. And by changing the sequence slightly, I can make different, stronger forms of Xpect! And it will all be mine to control!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire and Bella dropped Elizabeth off at The Olive Branch, and they drove off to the mall.  Elizabeth waddled inside, the weight of her unborn occupants beginning to take its toll on her.  As she entered the building, she was greeted by Joann.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth, oh my...you've gotten bigger again...\" she said, utterly shocked at Elizabeth's size, which would only increase in the following days.  \"Yep, you're not too small yourself!\" Elizabeth noted, trying to change the topic of her hugeness.  Joann had gotten bigger as well, but being seven months pregnant with triplets would do that to a woman.  Her belly was a incredibly round, accentuated by the tight black shirt she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we aren't the only ones like this.  Here comes Carol...\" Joann said.  A series of loud thuds were heard, as the kitchen door was opened.  Carol walked out, a full-term looking belly leading the way.  Her white button-down shirt was straining to contain it.  \"Good morning, Elizabeth.  I must admit I'm a little surprised that you're still able to walk...\"she noted, drawing a hand to her belly, then immediately removing it, as if she was ashamed to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a belly rumbled, and it wasn't Elizabeth or Joann's.  \"E-excuse me.  I'm just a little bit hungry...skipped breakfast...\" Carol said, as she waddled back into the kitchen.  \"So what's the deal with her?  Has she seen a doctor yet?\"  Elizabeth asked, as she felt a few strong kicks.  \"Nope.  She keeps saying how it's impossible, but look at you!  No offense!\"  Joann said.  \"None taken.\"  Elizabeth replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to work as customers started to arrive.  Waiting on tables was beginning to become extremely taxing on Elizabeth's body, as the weight of her gravid orb of life was weighing her down.  Still, she powered through it, but she knew that she'd have to go on maternity leave soon.  An hour or two passed when Joann approached Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Elizabeth, I've decided.  We need to hold a little intervention for Carol.  She's starting to get big, and she's still denying it.  I really don't want her water to break on the job, which might happen if we don't get her to the doctor to see what's up with her.\" she explained.  \"You're right.\" Elizabeth said.  The two pregnant women waddled into the kitchen, where Carol was continuing to binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol, we need to talk.\"  Elizabeth said.  \"About what?\"  Carol asked, pretending that everything was completely normal.  \"Listen, hun.  You need to stop beatin' around the bush.  You've got a bun in the oven, and it looks like it won't be long until it's cooked.\"  Joan said, placing a hand on Carol's rounded middle.  \"I've told you, I'm not...okay.  I give up.  Something's wrong with me...\"Carol trailed, obviously upset about her impending motherhood.  \"Hey, look.  You're not in this alone we're here for you.\"  Elizabeth said.  \"Th-thank you, Elizabeth.\" Carol said. The three women waddled into Joann's car, where they drove off to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mall, Claire and Bella were on their way to Baby Universe.  They made it to the store, but it was beyond packed with pregnant women and men alike.  Two of these people were Kenna and Ethan, who both had large bellies of their own.  \"I can't believe I'm pregnant with twins!  Men don't get pregnant!\" he said.  \"Well, obviously they do now, Ethan.\"  Kenna replied, a bit annoyed.  \"I'm freaking out, man!\" Ethan said, as Claire decided to get what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching, she was unable to find clothes bigger than the ones she currently owned.  She found the store owner, who was sporting a large quintuplet bump, her maternity dress seriously straining.  \"Excuse me, but are there any maternity clothes that are larger than the ones that I bought a few days ago?\" she asked.  \"I'm sorry, but we don't.  I mean, look at me!  If I get any bigger my dress will burst!  But I would be happy to give you a discount on cribs.\" she said with an encouraging smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, could I order, uh, 33 of them?\" Claire asked.  The owner's eyes widened.  \"Uh...sure.  I'll have them deliver them to your house and they'll be there in a few days.\"  she replied.  After Claire made her purchases, she grabbed a quick, albeit large lunch, and left the mall with Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth, Joann, and Carol arrived at the hospital and waddled inside.  \"Hi, again.  Could we see an OB/GYN, please?\"  Elizabeth asked, noting that it was the same receptionist from her earlier visit.  \"Let me see if Dr. Stevens is available.\" she said, getting up with some struggle.  Like most of the town, she was sporting a pregnant belly, although she was clearly the smallest of the other women.  A few minutes later, she returned.  \"He can see you now.\" she said, taking a seat as her chair creaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth entered the examination room first, where Dr. Stevens was waiting.  \"Oh, hello Elizabeth.  I see you've bought new friends?\" he said.  \"Yep.  Can you give Carol here an ultrasound?\" she asked.  \"Sure thing.  Just get up on the table and I'll give you a quick examination.\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth and Joann helped Carol onto the table.  Dr. Stevens unbuttoned her shirt and squirted the gel on her rotund stomach.  \"So have you guys tried that new energy drink yet?  Xpect or whatever it's called?  I tried it a few days ago.  Disgusting.\" he said as he turned on the ultrasound machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let me just get an exact number...congrats, you're having quintuplets!  You're roughly four months along!\" he said.  \"Five babies?!?  But that's impossible!\" Carol declared.  \"Take a look at the scan if you want, but this,\" he said patting her belly,\"is very real.\"  Carol sat bewildered as Dr.  Stevens wiped the gel off of her stomach.  \"So do you two want an ultrasound?\" Dr. Stevens asked.  \"Well...\" Elizabeth began.  \"I reckon it wouldn't hurt.\" Joann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat on their respective tables, and the doctor began to examine the two of them.  \"Well, it's still octuplets and triplets, but Elizabeth, you're six months along, and Joann, you're seven.\"  He stood up, allowing the women a look at the small gut that he was currently forming.  \"I don't get it.  Never in my career has this happened!\" Dr. Stevens exclaimed.  Elizabeth, Joann, and Carol left, and returned to The Olive Branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the current state of Carol, she decided to close the restaurant for the day.  Elizabeth called Claire, and waited for her to arrive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elizabeth sat on a bench near the entrance to the hospital, one hand caressing her enormous belly intimately while the other looked through her phone. Every now and then, Elizabeth felt the urge to go back and look at the erotic photo Claire sent her yesterday. She knew Claire wanted to break things off, but she couldn't ignore how she felt in her heart. Elizabeth was in love with Claire, and despite having eight fetuses kicking around inside her stomach, Elizabeth felt utterly alone without Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting for someone, hon?\" Joann asked, waddling next to Elizabeth on the bench. \"My husband's comin' to get his big fat bride.\" She wrapped her hands around her own seven-month triplet belly, smiling and sighing. \"He insisted I didn't leave until he got here. I probably gave him a bad scare when I said I was at the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He cares,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is,\" Joann grinned back. \"I thought these were babies we made with love, but given how big I've been growing and now the news that I'm already seven months along...I'm not so sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you both love each other, it's still your love babies,\" Elizabeth said, reaching a hand over and resting it on Joann's bulging belly. She was far beyond a typical full-term pregnant belly, but her updated wardrobe kept a tight, black fabric cover around her pregnance. \"And if you still get to 'make love,' it's even better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoann giggled. \"Maybe it's just a Southern thing, but I remember hearing my parents going at it even when my momma was at the end of her pregnancies with my little brothers and sisters. I never thought anyone with a tummy that big could have sex, but I'm even bigger and...\" Joann laughed again. \"And I do just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Elizabeth smiled, turning her gaze as Claire's car pulled up. \"Well, you'll have to give me the details later at book club.\" Elizabeth put her hands on the back of the bench to brace herself, heaving her gigantic belly forward. The strain snapped her suspenders back, only accentuating her breasts' size and strain on the rest of her body. Claire parked by the curb and waddled over as quickly as she could, trying to give Elizabeth a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help?\" Claire asked, their bellies touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine,\" Elizabeth murmured, blushing whenever she and Claire made contact. \"Thanks for getting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Claire said, biting her lip, thinking over her next words. Then she noticed Joann and smiled politely, realizing now was not the best time or place to get into their \"relationship.\" \"Bella drove me here, so we can relax in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice,\" Elizabeth said, smiling for an instant then hiding her face again. Claire frowned slightly, sorry to see her previously strong and confident friend now so sheepish. \"Off to the baby shower now, huh? Even there, we'll probably stand out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't doubt it,\" Claire sighed, opening the back door for Elizabeth to squeeze into. Her buttons came undone and Elizabeth's smooth, enormous brown belly was out on display. Luckily for her, Elizabeth was already inside the car and didn't have to hide her true size from passersby as Claire heaved herself inside as well, her own shirt riding halfway up her belly, held barely in place by Claire's big popped-out navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All secured?\" Bella said, looking in the rear mirror at her mother and Elizabeth. \"Let me know now, because I don't want you both to bump around back there and have your water break. I am not mentally prepared to deliver my mother's babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you care so much about your pregnant mother,\" Claire replied in a slightly-sarcastic \"mom tone.\" \"We'll be fine. Besides, we aren't going to give birth for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as long as we thought,\" Elizabeth whispered. Claire turned to Elizabeth as Bella hit the gas and headed for the baby shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Claire whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I was there, I had another ultrasound,\" Elizabeth said, dropping her voice again. \"I'm six months pregnant already...and I'll bet it's the same for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turned pale, looking forward. How many days had it been since she even saw signs that she was pregnant? Six months already? What was going on inside her womb?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, do I really have to stay at this thing?\" Bella whined as she drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't exactly drive myself home with your brothers and sisters in here,\" Claire said, rubbing the front of her belly. Elizabeth felt herself blush again as she saw Claire rub. Even now, she wanted to jump Claire's bones and kiss her all over, feeling Claire's hand in her lap, on her breasts, against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...I'm not comfortable around pregnant women,\" Bella said. \"It creeps me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creeps you out?\" Claire said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to explain it...I just know I never want to be pregnant,\" Bella said, clamming up after that. Elizabeth leaned back in her seat, giving a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember Veronica telling me that once,\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Life can be cruel sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure can,\" Claire sighed back, both hands wrapped around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf an outsider came to the baby shower, it would be nearly impossible to know who the intended \"mom-to-be\" was. Nearly every person there was pregnant, man and woman alike. Claire and Elizabeth were bumping into bellies wherever they went and were attracting lots of attention. After all, at a gathering of pregnant bellies, theirs were the biggest. That was sure to turn some heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the weirdest baby shower I've ever been to,\" Claire muttered, looking over at Elizabeth's belly. \"Are your buttons holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Elizabeth moaned, putting her hands on the sides of her belly. \"Everyone's already looking at me and there's lots of cameras out. I don't want my enormous bare belly on the Internet for people to jerk off to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People do that?\" Claire said in shock. Elizabeth smiled and turned to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're turned on by each other's bellies. You really think we're the only ones?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blushed brightly. \"Elizabeth, please, can we not...bring that up again? I told you, I'm married and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to say anymore,\" Elizabeth smiled, reaching a hand out to Claire's shoulder before changing her mind and putting it on her hip. \"I'll behave, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone gather around,\" Susan, the mom-to-be of honor, said, standing up on a small platform, a baggy dress around her small, simple, one-baby belly. \"Well, when I originally planned this baby shower, I was expecting to stick out like an over-inflated thumb, but now...I'm not sure whether to be relieved or terrified.\" The crowd laughed uncomfortably in response. \"But still, I'm so glad so many of you could come out. I've got some games planned, so let's all have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd clapped as Claire felt a hand on her shoulder. \"Brad? Brittany?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom,\" Brittany said, giving a tiny smile. \"We thought you'd need a ride back, but it looks like Bella's still here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just grumpy,\" Claire said, rolling her eyes. \"But I'm glad you could make it. Not too boring, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Brad and Brittany both said in unison, cheeks red from looking at huge pregnant bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone look under your glasses. There's a number attached,\" Susan said. \"The person with the other number is your partner for this next game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked at his cup. \"22?\" he said loudly, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" Elizabeth chuckled, waddling over to Claire's son. \"Well, at least we know each other. That'll make it easier to work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Brad nodded vacantly, trying not to look at Elizabeth's incredible pregnant body. Claire was paired up with Bella, much to her daughter's dissatisfaction, while Brittany was paired up with the heavily pregnant and athletic Barbara (friend of a friend, she explained), still clad in her grey spandex top, giving Brittany plenty of her belly to view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a relay race,\" Susan explain with a smile. \"You and your partner run back and forth to the pile of baby dolls. One of you runs, while the other one changes their diapers. First to 10 wins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do the running,\" Bella said, looking off to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Claire giggled. When Susan blew her whistle, Bella was off, much faster than the rest of the shower thanks to a rare medical condition known as \"Not Being Pregnant.\" Claire, with her experience of raising three children, whizzed through each diaper change. Brittany and Barbara were on their tale, thanks to Barbara's athletic ability. Elizabeth, on the other hand, had long ago stumbled and knocked her shirt open. Brad fell face-first into her belly and became similarly incapacitated. Running with an erection is quite tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, in the end, Bella and Claire were able to clinch victory. Claire jumped for joy as much as she could, her belly and breasts jiggling and slapping all over the place. Her shirt rolled all the way up, her whole belly hanging out for everyone to see, eliciting a few gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Claire,\" Susan smiled, handing she and Bella a goodie bag. \"First place prize is a few trinkets and a complimentary can of Xpect, thanks to Barbara's store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan handed out the other prizes, Claire sighed and looked at the can in her hands. \"Well I certainly am not drinking this stuff anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can I finally try some?\" Bella asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's alcohol in it, according to Brad,\" Claire said, seeing the excitement in Bella's eyes. \"But...I suppose you earned it. Save it for your 18th birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll remember,\" Bella smiled. \"And a little bit of alcohol won't kill me. Worried I'll get drunk, have sex, and get pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I trust you. I'm sure that won't happen,\" Claire laughed, giving her daughter a light hug around the neck. \"One can of Xpect won't make you pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following Susan's baby shower, Brad and Brittney decided to visit the park.  It had been a wild couple of days, and they needed some time to relax.  They were far from the only ones, as there were dozens of pregnant moms and dads playing with their kids.  Because Brittany was still getting accustomed to her large belly, she took a seat on a bench, where Brad joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've always wanted to be pregnant, but triplets right of the bat?  It's a bit overkill.\"  Brittany said, rubbing her gravid middle as her occupants kicked inside.  \"At least you getting pregnant is humanly possible.  Men getting pregnant doesn't even make sense!\"  Brad said, trying his hardest to not touch his own pregnant belly.  \"Wait, you don't know that caused it?  It's those Xpect drinks!\"  Brittany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Xpect makes you pregnant?  How?\"  Brad asked, shocked that such a mundane thing could make a person filled with life.  \"I'm not really sure.  Ms. Flora, the school's chemistry teacher, is researching it.  She's having sextuplets herself.\"  Brittany said.  \"So one energy drink has made pretty much the whole town pregnant?\"  he asked, still trying to grasp the idea.  \"Yep.\"  Brittany responded bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brad was trying to think, he could see Monica, wearing the athletic gear that was way too small for her pregnant form, running towards them.  \"Oh, hey.  There's Monica.\"  Brittany said.  \"Y-yeah.\"  Brad said, remembering the event that happened earlier in the day.  \"Why don't you go talk to her if you like her so much?\"  she asked him.  \"Wait, what?  I-I don't like--\" Brad said before getting cut off.  \"Oh, come on.  I see the way you look at her.  Go over and talk to her!\"  Brittany said, encouraging him.  After a few moments of thought, Brad walked over to Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Monica!\"  Brad yelled, trying to get her attentions.  She turned around and removed her earbuds.  \"Oh, it's you.  Hey.\" she said coldly.  \"I know I really fucked up earlier, but I'm just really in over my head with this whole pregnancy thing, and I need someone to go through it with.\" he said.  \"Fine.  I forgive you.\"  she said, flashing a smile.  After making up, they continued to walk and talk around the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, Roy was taking Kat to the hospital for a checkup.  \"Okay, so the sextuplets are looking healthy.  They're about six months along.\"  Dr. Stevens said.  Kat smiled at this news.  Although she wasn't exactly ready to become a mother, she was happy that everything was going smoothly.  Roy helped her off the table, as she pulled her shirt down as far as she could.  She was wearing the same sweatpants and t-shirt combo from yesterday, but her much larger belly helped display a lot of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waddled out of the hospital and entered Roy's car.  \"So what do you want to do now?\" he asked her.  Before she could answer, her stomach let out a massive rumble.  \"Can we get something to eat?\" she asked.  \"But we just had lunch an hour ago.\"  Roy noted.  \"I know.  You've never heard of second lunch before?\" she asked.  \"Okay.  We'll get you something to eat.\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings between Roy and Kat were going well.  They had been on a few dates, and they began to spend a lot of time together.  For Kat, it was nice to finally be able to talk to someone about her pregnancy, and Roy had always been interested in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy drove to the local all-you-can-eat buffet and let Kat out of the car.  Roy wasn't hungry, but Kat definitely was.  For about an hour, Kat stacked plate after plate of food, devouring whatever was on it.  All in all, it was one of their better dates.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire, Elizabeth, and Bella pulled into the library's parking lot, having to make a few attempts due to Claire's belly making careful turns difficult. When they were finally in, Claire groaned as she slung one arm underneath her enormous belly and turned around to Bella in the back seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to wait in the car or sit in with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait in the car,\" Bella said immediately, getting out her cellphone and tapping away. \"You both have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed and undid her seatbelt, which wrapped between her heaving breasts awkwardly, and heaved herself slowly out of the car. \"Alright, you too dear.\" Claire waddled around the front of the car, hands on her lower back, arching herself out, as Elizabeth waddled around, doing the same. Their bellies touched in the process, and despite the lingering awkwardness between them, neither pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left Bella the keys, so all that's left is to go inside, huh?\" Claire said, cheeks turning slightly red. Elizabeth gave a little smile and nodded and the two clumsily walked into the library, bellies and breasts bouncing along. As they waddled in, Renee Flora pulled in to the parking lot, watching Claire and Elizabeth with glee. She'd been following Brittany all day, trying to find an opportunity to get Claire alone. She would be the perfect person to experiment on if she wanted to brew her own stronger Xpect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woman beside her looks just as big,\" Renee purred to herself, admiring Elizabeth's belly. \"But for now, I'd better stick with Brittany's octo-mom. She'll be easier to work with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the library, the usual book club was assembled. Only now, everyone's bellies were bigger. Joann gave Elizabeth a hug and rubbed her own triplet belly as she sat back down. She looked huge for a regular pregnant woman, with her belly jutting out like a swollen, fleshy torpedo with a little belly-button nub on the end. Since changing out of her restaurant clothes, Joann switched into a flannel shirt that let her show off her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again, Joann,\" Claire smiled, looking past Elizabeth's belly to see Joann. \"You look...a lot bigger since I last saw you. Still only five months to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor today told me seven,\" Joann sighed with a little smile, patting her belly. \"Something tells me this isn't a 'typical' pregnancy. Then again, I don't think any of ours are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again,\" Tina and Joselyn said in unison. The married soon-to-be moms of quadruplets were sporting bellies even bigger than Joann's. They both smiled and put their hands on one another's huge bumps, rubbing softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's made me worried about what this might be,\" Taylor, a young teacher at Brittany and Bella's high school, said, poking her mushy middle. \"It was all abs until this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the same worry,\" Rachel, a college student and the youngest in the room, said, cupping a hand over her own belly. \"A friend gave me this gross energy drink and I was in bed throwing up all yesterday. If I'm pregnant on top of that, I'm going to be nauseous for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes away,\" Claire said with a little smile. \"Trust me, I have three children and eight more on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all laughed over their pregnancies, Renee strode into the room, wearing a short, tight skirt and a green top that would have shown off her belly and clung tightly to her breasts even if she wasn't six months pregnant with sextuplets. \"Hello everyone. Is this the book club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, hello there!\" Jennifer smiled, slowly standing up with one hand against her twin-belly. \"I'm Jennifer, head of community outreach programs here. And you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Renee, a high school chemistry teacher and I'm six months pregnant with sextuplets,\" Renee beamed, rubbing and stroking her bare belly. \"I see one familiar face here. Hi Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi,\" Taylor blushed. Taylor had fallen prey to Renee's flirtatious wiles a few days ago, making love in the high school gym. While there, Renee also slipped Taylor a prototype of the Xpect she'd been trying to make. Renee looked at Taylor's stomach and was glad that it appeared to work, but still hoped for much, much better results. One look at Claire's bare belly, however, and Renee's thighs rubbed together in excitement. She had her perfect specimen right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Renee,\" Asma smiled across the room, legs crossed so her belly stood out in the air. \"It's nice to meet someone else who can walk in with an air of style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you,\" Renee smiled back. If only she didn't have to work with Claire, she'd gladly try and coerce Asma into spending a night of bliss with her, belly against belly. Same for Elizabeth, with her enormous mocha belly, full, maternal breasts, and gentle model's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, instead of chatting about our bellies today,\" Jennifer said, leaning down slowly to pick up a stack of books. \"I thought we could read a book about women who try to get pregnant but are unsuccessful: The Handmaiden's Tale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've read this,\" Rachel nodded, taking a copy from Tina as they passed the stack around. \"It ends kind of sad. Although there's that epilogue, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give it away,\" Joselyn laughed, opening the first pages. \"So do you want us to read any of it now or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's just talk about the idea presented in the book first. In The Handmaiden's Tale, most people can't have children anymore. So let's turn that back on ourselves. We seem to be living in a time with...abundant pregnancy. Are we all happy about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was split. Rachel and Taylor were not at all looking forward to their inevitable pregnancy test back home. Tina and Asma were not planning on getting pregnant but were accepting. Joselyn, Renee, and Joann were overjoyed. Claire and Elizabeth were...on the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little tricky because...my daughters are pregnant too,\" Elizabeth said, stopping before she included her son on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter as well,\" Claire sighed, placing a hand on her belly. \"But we've been able to bond over it some, so that's been a big positive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter is...Brittany Perkins, isn't she?\" Renee said with an innocent smile. Claire smiled and said yes. \"I'm her chemistry teacher. We've actually been working very closely on some experiments in my private lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a very bright girl,\" Claire smiled. \"I'm glad she's taking the extra initiative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the book club wound down and Jennifer assigned some reading and topics to think about, they all waddled outside, Joann and Elizabeth chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your husband doesn't mind the belly?\" Elizabeth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took some getting used to, especially since I'm getting so big so fast, but I think he still likes me,\" Joann smiled. \"He sure likes my boobs, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth laughed as Renee got out her phone, pretending to get a phone call. \"Oh, Claire, hold on a moment...I just got a call from Brittany. She said there was an accident at my private lab. I think you should come with me in case she's been injured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...of course,\" Claire nodded, hurrying over to her car, her belly making her speedy waddle even more awkward. \"Bella? Will you please ride with Elizabeth back home? I need to go with Ms. Flora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Bella nodded as Elizabeth and Joann got into the car. \"We're giving your friend a ride too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind,\" Elizabeth said. \"Her husband had to ride errands. And if you don't mind...can you drive? My belly and ankles are so sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have my learner's permit,\" Bella said sadly. \"Mom won't let me get my license until I'm 18.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine,\" Elizabeth smiled. \"Just tell them I'm your mom.\" The lie made Elizabeth think of her dream again, when Elizabeth and Claire were together and Bella really was her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, hon?\" Joann said quietly, seeing the sadness in Elizabeth's face as she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...I'll tell you later,\" Elizabeth whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Renee's car, Claire heaved herself into the back, getting the seatbelt across her belly and breasts again. \"Did Brittany say what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A chemical spill. No idea if it was toxic or not yet,\" Renee said, looking at Claire in the rear view. \"Comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable? My daughter might be in danger. I don't care about that. Let's go!\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" Renee grinned, driving off, the vibrator in her underwear helping her excitement grow and grow.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes her name was called.  \"Time to shine, little ones.\" she said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked onto the stage, and observed the crowd, a smile spreading across her face.  \"Good evening, everyone.  My name's Asma, spelled A-S-M-A, not like asthma, the illness.\" she said, a few faint chuckles coming from the crowd in response.  \"So I'm pregnant with triplets, which means I'm gonna be as big as a house by the time I give birth.  I wouldn't know what a house looks like, because I live in an apartment.  I mean, this economy, right?\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you actually gonna tell jokes?\" one heckler asked.  A few muttering agreements rang out.  \"Hey, I am telling jokes, and they're hilarious.  It's not my fault your stupid brain can't comprehend them.\" she said, feeling a few strong kicks.  This was met with heavy boos, but what other reaction was expected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGET OFF THE STAGE!\" a heckler yelled.  \"YOU GOING INTO LABOR WOULD BE FUNNIER THAN YOUR JOKES!\" another shouted.  Asma waddled offstage, surprisingly upbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nailed it, as usual.\" she said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor sat in her bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror, or more accurately, her gut.  She pressed her hand to it, and felt that it was tight, unlike fat.  She continued to look at it, when a quick flurry of beeps emanated from her stop watch.  Taylor realized that it was time to check her pregnancy test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed it off the counter and gave it a look.  PREGNANT.  Suddenly the door opened, and Taylor shoved the pregnancy test in her pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her mother.  \"Ready to head out for dinner?\" she asked.  \"Y-yeah.  I'm pretty hungry.\" Taylor replied.  \"Well good.  So when are you gonna settle down and start a family?\" her mom asked.  \"One of these days, mom.  One of these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rachel was in the same position as Taylor, sitting in her and her boyfriend's apartment.  She looked at the positive pregnancy test in her hand, shaking her head.  Her boyfriend, John, walked in.  \"Hey, baby.  Wait...is that...is that a pregnancy test?\" he asked.  \"Yep.\" she buried her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?  I mean, I kinda had a feeling, because you've been getting sick and it looked like you gained a little weight, but the first time we had sex was only three days ago.\"  \"I know.  It just doesn't make sense.\" she said.  \"Oh, god.  Are we gonna be ready for this?\" he asked.  \"I guess we have to be, right?\" Rachel responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked over to her and gave her a hug, taking a seat next to her.  Rachel looked at him.  \"You know, it looks like you've gained a bit of weight yourself.\" Rachel smiled, noticing his slight bulge.  \"I guess I'm having a sympathy pregnancy.\" he said.  She smiled, tears filling her eyes.  \"Don't worry, Rachel, we'll get through this.  Together.\" he said, letter her rest her head on his shoulder.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire rested a patient hand on top of her enormous pregnant belly as Renee pulled into her parking lot. \"Your private lab is run out of your house?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. It makes things much easier,\" Renee smiled, excited for the progress she could make on her Xpect experiments once she gets Claire inside. \"There are a lot of tests I can't exactly get the high school to let me run in the little chemistry lab they have there.\"<br>\r\n\"What kinds of tests?\" Claire asked, turning to Renee. She studied Brittany's teacher carefully, eyes picking up her perky cheeks, full, ruby red lips, piercing violet eyes, the way her black bangs fell across her porcelain skin, and of course, her huge, bare belly. Claire's own octuplet-filled womb outdid Renee's easily in terms of size, but Renee's belly was nothing to shake a stick out. Claire gulped and felt her ears get a little red. She'd never looked at women like this before...well, before Elizabeth. Maybe their dreams and short tryst woke something up inside Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Renee smiled, pouting her lips out in thought, leaning close to Claire. \"Tests on pregnancy. Aren't you curious about why all of the pregnancies in the city have been so...abnormal?\" Renee placed her own hand on Claire's belly, petting her student's mother gently.<br>\r\n\"Sure I have,\" Claire said, looking down at her massive bulge, feeling kicking and movement inside. \"I can't think of any reason why my pregnancy, and everyone else's, would develop so quickly. Or why some men have turned up pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's what Brittany has been helping me with,\" Renee said, her lips inches from Claire's, trying to hold back from making out with one of the city's premiere octomoms. \"But we'd better go inside, shouldn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if Brittany's in trouble,\" Claire nodded, turning and struggling to get out of the car. Renee bit her lip and rubbed her thighs together as Claire groaned and heaved her belly and breasts around in the cramped car. She was so full, so uncomfortably pregnant and ripe. Renee knew she'd found the perfect woman to brew more Xpect inside.<br>\r\nRenee didn't have much of an easier time getting out of the driver's seat, but with sextuplets instead of octuplets, she was at least able to make it out in time to help Claire out. \"Need help waddling over?\" Renee asked with a snake-like smile, wrapping an arm around Claire's torso, belly pressing against belly.<br>\r\n\"That would be nice,\" Claire smiled back, making it into Renee's front door at a slightly quicker pace. Why didn't she ever try to move around with Elizabeth like this? Then again, with their belly sizes, they wouldn't be able to see much in front of them and they'd probably bowl some innocent bystanders over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire disconnected herself from Renee's grasp once inside and waddled around, looking at Renee's house and lab. There were certainly charts and beakers all around, but in the dark, she couldn't see much else. \"Hello?\" Claire called out. \"Brittany? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\nNo response. Claire placed her hands on the side of her belly and rubbed slowly, trying to quiet her kicking fetuses, who only got more excited as Claire looked around Renee's home.<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get the light,\" Renee smiled, hitting the light switch. Claire could clearly see what was in Renee's house now. All of the beakers, flasks, and other tubes were filled with a familiar dark liquid, all shooting around and boiling or freezing or having some other type of testing done on them. Claire looked at them with a skeptical eye, trying to remember where she saw this stuff before. Then she picked her eyes up and saw what Renee's posters were. They weren't all just periodic tables and molecular charts. The first poster Claire saw was a scantily clad pregnant Renee, bent over and making a lewd face.<br>\r\nLooking around the room, there were all kinds of posters and other little pictures of nude or mostly nude pregnant women, about half of them Renee at various \"months.\" Claire felt her face turn pale when she spotted a few non-sexual pictures: photos of her and Elizabeth, snapped all over town, especially catching her whenever her ill-fitting clothes showed off her bare belly.<br>\r\n\"Renee...what is all of this?\" Claire started to say as Renee crept up behind her, injecting Claire in the neck stealthily. \"Oh! I feel...dizzy...\"<br>\r\n\"You should,\" Renee said, holding her arms under Claire's shoulders as Claire went limp, dragging Claire slowly to a back room. \"Oof, you're heavy, but then again, that's why I picked you.\" Renee cackled and took the opportunity with her hand placement to give Claire's breasts a few good squeezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wasn't unconscious, but she couldn't move her arms and legs very well and her whole mind felt hazy. She was propped up in a big medical chair but wasn't strapped down or otherwise restricted. If she could move her body, she could probably escape. But, of course, she couldn't move. Claire looked around the room, which was filled with even more vials of the black liquid, and along with the typical pornographic pregnancy posters, were a few medical charts showing gestation over time and cross-sections of pregnant women with multiples.<br>\r\n\"Comfortable?\" Renee smiled, putting down a few vials she was fiddling with to walk over to Claire, rolling up her shirt and rubbing her bare belly. \"I didn't tie you down because I'd hate to see a gorgeous preggo in any kind of pain or discomfort.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's why you made me drunk?\" Claire said slowly, looking up at Renee.<br>\r\n\"Not drunk exactly,\" Renee giggled, walking behind a curtain and taking off the few clothes she had on. \"It's another chemical concoction I came up with. It stunts your nerve signals, especially in your limbs, but nothing that will harm your darling little babies.\" Renee stepped back out, wearing a small white strap across her breasts with a big red + over her left breast. Her skirt was replaced with an even shorter, white skirt, with a few straps for putting medical equipment. \"Like my sexy nurse outfit?\" Renee purred, jutting out her belly and running her hands over her enormity. \"Of course, this is what makes me really sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're obsessed with pregnancy?\" Claire slurred, looking between her own belly and Renee's.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Renee said. \"I've always loved pregnant women and wanted to be one myself. And not just one or two babies. I want the jackpot. Of course, you got a little luckier than me,\" she smiled, pressing their bellies together, \"but that's okay. With your help, I'll be able to get even bigger and help other women get bigger bellies too.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't see how I can help,\" Claire said as Renee walked back with a few flasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start at the beginning: I found out why we were all getting pregnant. Ever hear of Xpect?\" Renee said, getting turned on by the idea of giving a supervillain monologue.<br>\r\n\"Xpect? That disgusting energy drink?\" Claire said, thinking back to all the people she knew tried it. \"You mean...that drink made us...\"<br>\r\n\"Big sexy pregnant folks, that's right,\" Renee beamed. \"With Brittany's help, I figured this out a few days ago. And I also figured out how to make an even stronger Xpect, plus others with some different special characteristics.\"<br>\r\n\"Stronger?\" Claire said, worried. \"What do you mean stronger?\"<br>\r\nRenee chuckled, rubbing her belly against Claire's again. \"Let's just say, with my new Xpect, you'd be one of the smaller women who drink it.\" Renee held up her beakers to the light, checking on them. \"But it's hard stuff to make. I don't quite know how it was originally made, but I've found a promising brewery: your womb.\"<br>\r\n\"My...\" Claire gasped, getting worried. \"You'll hurt my babies!\"<br>\r\n\"No, no, I worked out all the kinks,\" Renee sighed. \"I've even found a way for it to be taken orally and still brew inside your uterus. Now, bottoms up.\"<br>\r\nClaire wanted to protest, but she was so weak from Renee's injection that she couldn't do anything. Renee tiled Claire's head back and poured the black liquid into her mouth, swallowed by Claire easily. Her breasts and ass began to swell slowly, straining her already strained clothes.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that acted a lot quicker than I thought,\" Renee said, making a check on a clipboard. \"Oh well. This isn't exactly ventured science. Now, let's get the rest of these inside your belly, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must feel funny, huh?\" Elizabeth said to Bella as she rubbed her own octuplet belly. \"Being the only one in the family not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, there's also Dad,\" Bella sighed. \"But the way things have been going...maybe not. Guess we'll have to see when he gets back.\"<br>\r\n\"True,\" Elizabeth said, eyelids dropping some. Brad Sr. was the reason Claire rejected more of a relationship with Elizabeth. Her heart was still hurting over that. <br>\r\n\"But I dunno. I'm glad I'm not pregnant,\" Bella said. \"No offense, but I think it's...gross.\"<br>\r\nElizabeth laughed a little. \"Some aspects, sure, but I think it's wonderful.\"<br>\r\n\"Even when it's eight? Even when your daughters and...and your son are pregnant?\" Bella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth sighed and looked down at her spectacular, huge belly. \"It's complicated, for sure, but...I still love the feeling of being pregnant and I'm happy I can share this with my children now, because I doubt I'll ever be able to in the future.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Bella said quietly, opening the driver's side door. She walked around and helped Elizabeth out of the car, her neighbor's belly rubbing against her. As they walked to the door, Brittany came out of the Perkins house, turning red when she saw Elizabeth.<br>\r\n\"Brittany?\" Elizabeth said. \"You're here? I thought you were...\"<br>\r\n\"Were where?\" Brittany said, hurrying as fast as her own triplet belly would let her to Elizabeth. \"And where's Mom?\"<br>\r\nElizabeth put her hand on Brittany's head and rustled her hair. \"She's fine. Hey, why don't you all hang out with Veronica and Christine at my house? I'm sure your Mom will be back soon.\"<br>\r\nThe two Perkins kids shrugged and went over and Elizabeth looked back out, letting out another worried sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Very interesting,\" Renee nodded, looking at her computer screen, just a few feet away from Claire. \"There are still so many questions I have about Xpect and the more I try to learn, the more I realize how little I understand this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-then stop,\" Claire mumbled, breathing deeply. After a few rounds of experimentation, she didn't fit in the chair Renee prepared for her very well. The first gulp of reactive formula turned Claire's already impressive pregnant chest into something resembling the colossal breasts someone would find in a pornographic comic book and made her ass swell so much the chair was beginning to groan and the stitching in Claire's pants had torn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second dose, using a slightly different mix, made Claire's belly swell out, adding even more weight to the already protesting chair. If Renee hadn't lifted Claire's blouse to get a good look at her bare belly, it would have torn apart. Claire was already six months pregnant with octuplets, so her current size caused Renee to take time out of her tests to admire, stroke, and kiss Claire's belly, all to Claire's slurred protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now with the third dose, the babies (still eight, as far as Claire could feel) inside her over-swollen womb began to kick and squirm more and more. Normally, that wouldn't be cause for too much concern on Claire's part, but the side effects of this particular formula also made her incredibly sensitive. Not only did every belly touch Renee indulged in send sparks down her spine, it seemed like Claire could feel her womb lining, making her twist and moan in her seat as well. Claire pressed her arms against the chair legs and struggled to her feet, her whole body trembling with effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah,\" Renee said, putting her hand on Claire's firm belly and pressing her back down into the chair. It didn't take much to get Claire back in. \"I expected this would happen. Even if my initial nerve-dulling serum begins to wear off, you're far too big and heavy now to get up before I notice.\" Renee grinned and flexed. \"Besides, I'm quite the athlete myself. Star of the soccer team in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Claire managed to get out. Renee sighed and pressed her own big, pregnant belly against Claire's, leaning in close, Renee's big red lips inches away from Claire's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really so bad to be here with me? Even for a night?\" Renee pouted, tracing her hand down Claire's cheek, which only made the super-expectant mother bite her lip to stop from crying out in pleasure. \"When you were in the throes of bliss after your third dosage, I heard what you called out. 'Elizabeth! Elizabeth!' I can be just as loving as her.\" Renee put her hands on both sides of Claire's now gargantuan breasts, fondling them gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll...never be like Elizabeth,\" Claire managed to get out before she tried to struggle out of her seat again. Renee didn't even have to push her back in this time as Claire slumped back into her chair, making it groan loudly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could know how wrong you are,\" Renee sighed, running her fingers down Claire's belly, giving her popped-out belly button a tweak. Claire let out a loud moan that time and Renee giggled, walking back to her table of medical tools. \"But just you being here has been a great help to me. It's time to extract the first batch of Renee Flora's Super Pregnancy Drink. I'll think of a catchier name later. 'Xpect' is hard to beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extract?\" Claire said, now genuinely worried for her wellbeing and the wellbeing of her children inside her belly. She moved her hands around her wide belly defensively, lips trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" Renee said, getting out a breast pump. \"I've thought this part through too.\" She undid Claire's buttons and opened her straining maternity bra, exposing Claire's now O-cup breasts. \"Wonderful,\" Renee purred, attaching the first pump. \"Now, since you're more sensitive, this will feel pretty intense, so if you'd like to let those feelings out on anyone...\" Renee gave Claire a soft kiss on the lips. \"Just say the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only...Elizabeth,\" Claire gasped, eyes now closed as the pumps started to suck the new Xpect from her bosom, the sensation too strong to control. Claire tried to latch onto feelings and thoughts of Brad Sr., but Elizabeth kept coming into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth paced around her porch anxiously, rubbing her belly in long circular motions. Anyone who walked by might think Elizabeth was a mother in her 42nd week, trying to bring on labor. Like her neighbor and one-time lover Claire, Elizabeth was only six months along with octuplets, or more accurately, six days along.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was used to those kinds of night walks, though. After carrying twins twice, she got to the point of \"uncomfortable bigness\" and wanted to bring her daughters into the world as quick as possible. When she was pregnant with Veronica and Roy, the doctors thought Roy was going to be a girl. Elizabeth was glad that, in the sudden panic of having to think up a boy's name, she didn't take her husband's. He left not long after those two were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Elizabeth was sorry she tried to hard to bring labor on. She loved being pregnant and missed it immensely. <i>Too bad this one is going back so quickly</i>, Elizabeth sighed, looking back down at her enormous tummy. <i>The way things are going, in another three or four days, I'll be back to being flat. But at least I'll have eight new babies to get to know</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoann's car pulled in front of her house and she opened the passenger's door, waddling out. \"Elizabeth!\" she called out in her cheery Southern draw, waving to her co-worker. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready,\" Elizabeth huffed, waddling down the steps to Joann's car, struggling to get into the backseat. Her shirt was ill-fitting to begin with and was now being pulled every which way, revealing plenty of bare brown belly and cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've met my husband before, right?\" Joann said, turning to the driver. \"Glad I'm not that big, hon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd just be harder in bed, but I'd get used to you,\" Joann's husband grinned, kissing Joann on the cheek. \"Where are we off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked up the address already,\" Elizabeth groaned, adjusting her seat so she wasn't being smushed against the door, leaving bruises on her belly. \"The last person I saw with Claire was that Renee woman from the book club and she said she was a teacher at Veronica and Roy's school. That's who we should check with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just tell me where to go,\" Joann's husband said as they headed for Renee Flora's lab and the mysteries held there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The experiments continued before Renee found something that would change everything, and it was discovered with a firm loud BURP. <br>\r\nThat burp came from Claire as the massive mix of chemicals and Xpect inside of her formed and mixed together to cause quite the gaseous reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these burps that Claire was beginning to experience was something far more terrifying - Xpect in a gas form, and the computer near Renee let her know that with a series of loud beeps, boops and pings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling herself over to the computer, she took a readout of Claire's \"emissions\". \"Incredible\" Renee said with a devilish grin. \"It's Xpect, in a gas form! Super concentrated and fast acting, if my calculations are - - - \" Renee went into technobabble overdrive, writing down equations and making educated guesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gas form of Xpect can make anyone within the affected area instantly pregnant! And we're not taking 1st trimester here either. We're taking 8 months with twins, easily. The super reaction from the experiments - - INCREDIBLE! I must harvest this!\" Renee said, shoving a strange device on top of Claire's face and watching the super concentraed Xpect gas slowly be filtered into small glass jars. It took a few moments for the Xpect gas to become visible inside the glass jar, as it slowly turned a thick fog of green, like something you would see out of a cheesy sci-fi movie about a mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is far better than I could have ever hoped!\" Clair moaned out a soft cry as Renee harvested the gaseous expect from her rather unfortunate prolonged case of burps, afraid of what this mad scientist could do with such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh. Don't cry. I have big things in store for this! Imagine it! A crowd gathered round, I open this jar, everyone breathes deep and suddenly men and women are suddenly massively pregnant! A wonderful demonstration for my new line of imitation Xpect Products. I will break down the gender roles! Now men will get pregnant for their wives! Childless couples will procreate with ease! A new utopia of pregnant people, men and women alike! A--- PREGTOPIA!\" Renee cackled as the last hanging thread of sanity snapped in twain thusly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sometime had passed Renee had finished harvesting the gas based Xpect, which she now dubbed Xpect Air, and was rambling on about her Pregtopia, \"Well, for being such a good and fertile, pardon the pun my dear, specimen, I'm going to do something special\" Renee said grabbing a rather long needle and injecting Claire with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Claire said before slowly drifting off. \"Oh stop being so dramatic. This is something quite special. It will reverse all that I've done to you and make you back to normal.. Well normal in terms of your pregnancy size. And to top it all off, a mild amnesiac to make this all seem like a bad dream\" Renee cackled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at her 7 jars of Xpect Air, she rubbed her hands together happily. \"One of you'll I keep here to study to replicate outside of my.. study. The other six of you will need to be field tested. But not all at once\" She said, grabbing a jar of Xpect Air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go make some bellies\" She said, looking at the evil looking swirling mist in the glass jar. \"But where should we demonstrate first?  The possibilities are endless!  This is gonna be huge!\" she laughed, noticing her pun, as Claire looked on in distress.</span></div></div>",

That you don't try and make the town pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee grinned and put her jar of Xpect Air down and waddled toward Claire, bending down to look her in the eyes. \"Nothing will stop me, but I'm listening. What do you think you have to offer me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took a deep breath. \"There's no one around who's as big and pregnant as me, is there?\" Renee's smile began to grow. \"This big shapely belly, these wide child-bearing hips, the plump ass, and my milk-filled breasts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true,\" Renee cackled. \"All very true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I become your lover, your swollen preggo lover,\" Claire said, trying to coo and flirt as much as she could despite her fear of the mad pregnant scientist and her stupor from the drugs Renee had used on her. \"What will you do for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire laughed out loud, her voice ringing out through her horrible laboratory. \"Now that is quite the barter. Let me think...I was planning on using this first dose of Xpect Air at my school. I already have a few big-bellied students and they are absolutely adorable. I'd love to see what an entire pregnant school would look like. Bu~t, if you want, you can pick where I set off the first Xpect Air. Is that fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire bit her lip. \"I won't be your lover just for that but...if I can stop you from turning every student pregnant, that's worth a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice,\" Renee grinned. \"Because this would have affected your children too, even if their bellies are already wonderfully full of babies. If you think <u>you're</u> the big one in the Perkins family, wait until young Brittney gets too close to one of these. Although it's been with Brittney's help that I was able to do any of this in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gulped, not wanting to know any details about that. \"So we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a deal,\" Renee smiled, wiggling her lips dangerously close to Claire's. \"Pick the location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's mind raced. She didn't think Renee would agree to any terms but she was more enamored with Claire's pregnant body than she expected. \"I-I've seen pamphlets for a women's infertility support group. It meets every week this day in...in about half an hour at the rec center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee knew exactly what Claire was talking about. In her maniacally thorough research of pregnancy and the city, she'd explored the possibility of using some of her own personal fertility supplements on the women there but her drugs never made it very far in research. But now that she had Xpect, which was far more effective than anything she had been working on, using the infertility meeting as a test site seemed totally natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got such a big heart, Claire,\" Renee cooed. \"A heart as big as your tummy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renee cackled and did typical villainous things, Joann's car pulled in front of her house. \"Guess this is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Elizabeth sighed, her hands wrapped around her belly as she struggled out of the car. \"Just stay here. I'll pop in quickly, tell Claire we're waiting for her, and we'll leave.\" Elizabeth waddled up to the porch and, just before she hit the doorbell, she saw inside the house and her jaw fell. From the porch, she could see the silhouettes of one very large bellied woman  \u2014 obviously Claire \u2014 kissing another large pregnant woman. Elizabeth assumed it was Renee, but all she knew for certain was it wasn't her. Claire was kissing a woman other than Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth bit her lip as she felt her eyes well up with tears. But she had to focus when Renee started walking toward the front door. Elizabeth may have been heavily pregnant with octuplets, but she managed to hurry to the side of the porch in a flash and hide in the bushes. Renee made her way out and paused for a second as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense...pregnancy. A very large pregnancy,\" Renee said to herself, looking around. She got closer and closer to the edge of her porch, inches away from spotting Elizabeth, when Joann's car started to rock. Renee hurried over and looked inside to see Joann and her husband half-way undressed in the back seat, Joann's bare belly pressed against the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" Joann hollered, giving Renee a deathly glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, go right ahead,\" Renee grinned, rubbing her belly with glee as she went to her own car. Elizabeth hurried into Renee's house as she watched Renee drive away and found Claire stumbling out of her chair. Elizabeth fumed as she grabbed Claire's wrist and hurried her into Joann's car, where she and her husband had already gotten back into their proper seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth!\" Claire cried out, holding her neighbor closely and peppering her with kisses. \"Oh thank god, I'm so glad to see you again! I love you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me,\" Elizabeth grumbled, pushing Claire away. \"Joann, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay with you two, hon?\" Joann asked in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Elizabeth barked and the car sped away. She gave Claire, who was still a little shaken and confused, a side-eye. \"I thought you really loved me,\" Elizabeth mumbled. \"But like everyone else I trusted my heart to, you betrayed me.\" They didn't speak for the rest of the car ride, and when each woman got home next door to one another, they fell into their bed and wept into their pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, Renee had just burst into the local meeting of the women's infertility support meeting. The women gathered there looked at Renee and her enormous belly with contempt. \"You again,\" one woman said. \"I recognize you from a few months ago when you prowled around here, making everyone uncomfortable. What, here to gloat and mock us with your pregnant belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Renee smiled, taking a bottle of Xpect Air and rolling it forward into the circle of chairs. \"I've come with a gift: the wonderful gift of pregnancy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud poof, the jar came open and a whoosh of faintly sweet air came out. With a yelp, the women looked down as their stomachs swelled before their eyes to incredible sizes. Those closest to the jar now resembled Renee in their voluptuousness while the women a few steps back had quadruplets and quintuplets instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Renee was looking down at her own belly, now considerably swollen as two more fetuses kicked inside her. \"Wow, the range was further than I expected,\" she noted to herself. \"I should be careful the next time I use this...or not!\" she laughed, patting her colossal octuplet belly and dreaming about carrying more.</span></div></div>",

She flashed the cans to Brad and Brittany, who stood there confusedly, waiting for her to throw them away like she did with all the other crap they brought home. She lifted the cans to her mouth and began to drink their contents at a jaw-droppingly fast clip. The cans' contents were emptied in a short 10 seconds.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Russia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky Banks, 30, was due to start filming later this week on an artistic film.  It was a sophisticated movie about integrity, and managing one's life in the face of economic turmoil and war.  She was going to be playing one of the principle roles, a pregnant woman in charge of a vast enterprise on the brink of collapse.  Her conflict with an aspiring entrepreneur and businessman was crucial to the movie, and she was eager to play the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she was doing now was nothing like that.  Her agent had booked a commercial in the same area, in the same week as shoots for the movie began.  It wasn't a company that Becky knew.  It was called Yaral Industries, and they weren't making a great impression.  Few of the people on location seemed to know how to speak her language.  The few that did were giving her directions for the commercial, but they knew nothing about directing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was standing in front of a giant green screen, with nothing but a tall stand beside her.  She preferred actual sets, but she was patient.  On the stand was a can of the energy drink, Xpect, that was being sold.  She knew nothing about the product, who it was marketed to, or what it really tasted like.  She didn't think that it was for her, in any case.  She tried to hold back her comments to the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paycheck was inordinate; that was the only reason that Becky was willing to take such an easy job.  She preferred artistic and effortful productions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Mrs. Banks, we are going to do the taste shots.  After that, we'll be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was ready.  On cue, she gave her line, \"Xpect, fills you with life,\" in Russian, and drank from the lukewarm can beside her.  She immediately convulsed.  The taste was horrendous, but she swallowed what she could.  \"What the hell is this stuff?\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut.  Mrs. Banks, let's keep going until we get the shot,\" said the director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbled.  Maybe this isn't worth it, she thought.  Nonetheless, she kept going.  When one can was done, they brought out another.  Then another.  As the director said, they went through as many cans as they needed to get the best reaction shot.  Becky, for her part, put on a masterful performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never doing a job for this company again,\" she texted to her agent.  The day had finished, and Becky Banks finally returned to her hotel.  When she got home, she vomited in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have never tasted anything so foul,\" she growled.  \"The things I have to do.\"  She decided that she would need to reevaluate her relationship with her agent.  Finally calming down, she looked around the hotel for her husband, who was still out.  He loved to sight see, but she hated when he went without him.  Not that she had the same appreciation for architecture; she just didn't like her husband to be away for too long.  The perils of the industry, and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband's name was Arthur, and he was a great actor in spite of himself.  Arthur didn't like the entertainment industry, but he had a natural talent.  She didn't know exactly what kept him working as an actor if he didn't like it, but any time she asked he was quick to brush it off.  Something just compelled him, she decided.  He was that kind of person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted with herself, and eager to take a break the next day, Becky put on some music and went to bed.  The beginning shoots for the movie were a few days away.</span></div></div>",

She entered the building and greeted the receptionist.  \"Good morning, Kathy!\" she beamed.  \"Good morning, Mrs. Raymond.\" the receptionist replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica got in the elevator and went to the top floor, where her office and her employees worked.  Once she reached the top floor, she was greeted by her assistant, Todd.  \"Good morning, Mrs. Raymond.  I hope you slept well.\" he said, hurrying behind her.  \"Indeed I did.\" she replied.  \"By the way, congrats on the anniversary tonight!  What's it been, like ten years?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten best years of my life.\" Monica responded, brushing her auburn hair back.  \"So do you and Andy have any special plans for tonight?\" Todd asked.  \"Well, we're going out to dinner, to the restaurant that he took me on our first date, and then I'm sure that will lead to a little somethin' somethin'...\" she said, winking to Todd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd frowned at this remark.  \"Right.  I guess one of the upsides to being infertile is that you don't have to hire a babysitter, right?\" he joked.  \"I guess so.  You know, I always wanted to be a mother, but I gotta admit it's fun not being on the pill and being able to only be responsible for yourself.  And I don't even know if I'd want to get pregnant now.  I mean, getting big and fat?  Stretchmarks?  Yuck, am I right?\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  I mean, it's not like I'd ever get pregnant.  Cause, ya know, I'm a guy.\" Todd said.  \"Wait, aren't you gay?\" she asked.  \"Yeah, but I can't get pregnant just because I'm gay.  You do know that, right?\" he asked.  \"What?  Yeah, uh, of course.  Duh.  What do I look like, a friggin' idiot or something?\" she asked, sitting down at her desk.  <i>Guess I can't believe everything I see on Facebook these days</i>. she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Monica.  So just to let you know, you have a meeting in half an hour.\" Todd said.  \"Great!  Thanks for letting me know.\" Monica said, as a female coworker walked in.  \"Hello, Mrs. Raymond.  I was working on two new flavors for EnerG and I was going to decide on one.  Which one do you think we should go through with?  Fruit punch or chocolate?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked her over.  The employee's name was Jodie, and she just became a full-time employee after being a temp.  She had just graduated college a few years ago, and was known as the office ditz, often dumbfounding the rest of the office with her thoughts.  \"Oh, fruit punch, definitely.  What was the other flavor?  Chocolate?  That sounds disgusting!  Nobody would drink that!\" Monica said.  \"Sorry!  I just had chocolate milk and it tasted good.\" she noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Monica walked to the conference room, and was greeted by a handful of the more valuable employees.  This included Charles, a balding middle-aged man, Tiffany, a woman in her early 60s, Danny, a man Monica's age, and Penny, Danny's wife.  After conversing with one another for a few minutes, they began their conference all with EnerG's stockholders, which was done over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mrs. Raymond, we're sorry to say this, but the numbers have been steadily decreasing over the past few months.\" said one stockholder.  \"Well, we're in a bit of a rut, I'll admit, but we're confident that we can and will bounce back.\" Monica said reassuringly.  \"Mrs. Raymond, empty promises mean little to us at this point.  If we don't see positive changes, and fast, we'll force you out of the company.\" said the stockholder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica gulped.  \"Well, do you have any suggestions on how we can improve?\" she asked.  \"Most of the energy drink market is riddled with the same old flavors.  It would be beneficial to add new, exciting flavors to the market, like chocolate, for instance.\" the stockholder said.  <i>Damn it, Jodie was right.</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well thanks for letting us know how you feel.\" said Monica.  \"No problem.  We'll talk in a couple of days, and hopefully by then you've turned things around.\" said the stockholder.  The meeting concluded, and they left the conference room, to see a brunette woman she had never seen before, standing next to a couple dozen cans of an energy drink she had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" Monica asked.  \"Hi!  I'm here to promote the newest product from Yaral Industries called Xpect!  And we want you all to try it!\" the representative said.  \"Yaral Industries?  Where the hell are you from?\" she asked.  \"Right now, Yaral Industries is located right across the street.\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employees looked out the window, and sure enough there was a tower with Yaral Industries' name on it.  \"Funny.  This is the first time I've seen that building.\" Monica noted.  \"Well, we're here to stay!  After years doing business in exotic locations such as Canada, we've decided to expand to the wonderful land of America, starting right here in New York City!\" she beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then.  Thanks for the introduction.  So why are you here again?\" Monica asked.  \"We realize that you are now our rivals, but we wanted to show respect by giving you Xpect for free!  Try some!\" she said, handing it out to everyone in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all took a sip.  Shortly after, they all either bolted to the bathroom or to a trashcan, violently vomiting.  When they returned, they found that the representative was gone.  \"Ugh, they probably made us sick on purpose.  Some respect they're showing there...\" Monica said, wiping her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least EnerG tastes better than Xpect...\" Todd said.  \"That's right.  Small victories, everyone.  Small victories.\" Monica replied.</span></div></div>",

Then, a light noise came from the computer projecting in the board room. \"Oh no,\" Monica gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's happened,\" Charles said, looking at the screen. \"Yaral Industries now officially owns EnerG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's now why I said 'Oh no,'\" Monica said. \"My water just broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Jodie said excitedly, hopping out of her seat before bending over and groaning too. \"Ooh...this doesn't feel as fun as I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did someone say Xpect?\" a silky voice said. The brunette who first came to the office to tell everyone about Xpect walked into the boardroom, a smile on her face that was almost as wide as her midsection. She, like everyone else in the room (and many other people in the city) was immensely pregnant, and like Jodie, didn't hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you,\" Monica growled, clutching her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, everything is going to be alright,\" the brunette smiled, taking Monica by the hand and walking her out of the boardroom. \"You can trust us. And now that we're working together, don't forget the Xpect slogan everyone: Xpect fills you with life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica bolted awake in bed, her mind a fuzzy blur of what she just experienced in her dream. Like with any dream, the images themselves faded away quickly, but she was left with one clear impression: she had been pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnancy dreams weren't uncommon for Monica. When she first learned that a developmental disorder in her ovaries would prevent her from ever being pregnant, Monica had lots of vivid dreams about being pregnant and having children she would never be able to carry or birth. They were unsettling enough, but Monica adjusted to the idea of never being pregnant with ease, but dreams about pregnancy remained. She'd never asked other women if they had similar dreams about pregnancy, so Monica didn't know if she was abnormal in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that dream felt particularly...odd. It felt real and she distinctly remembered several of her coworkers being involved. Every now and then they would pop up (including the occasional confusing dream involving her and Todd), but never that many at once. And one other thing stuck with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect fills you with life,\" Monica murmured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Andy said, stirring on his side of the bed, rolling over to face his wife. \"Did you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just a reaction to a weird dream,\" Monica smiled, patting her husband on the head. He smiled back, happy with his angle, looking up at his naked wife. Well, mostly naked. The bedsheet was still resting under her breasts. \"Good sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really knocked the energy out of me last night,\" Andy smiled. \"Too bad we had to stop a little early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Monica said, covering her mouth. \"And thanks for...changing the sheets after I threw up. It wasn't because of you, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Andy laughed again, bending over to kiss Monica against the hip. \"Maybe I was just too much for you and you got motion sickness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, honey,\" Monica sighed, patting Andy on the head. \"You're good, but not that good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy laughed and reached across Monica's torso. \"I won't bug you anymore. You're already armed with a throw pillow and I don't want to get hit in the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica continued to grin. \"Throw pillow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this pillow you're holding onto,\" Andy said, pulling back the sheets on Monica's side of the bed. To both of their surprises, what Andy saw bulging under the sheet was not a pillow, but Monica's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh my god,\" Monica said, placing her hand on her potbelly, stroking it gently. \"I'm...fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...o, you're not fat,\" Andy said. \"Look at you. Your sides, your thighs, everything-\" He paused. \"Everything else about you looks the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that pause?\" Monica said, narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest, your chest and...butt look a little bigger, but in a good way,\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Monica nodded. \"I wish I had that throw pillow now.\" Monica tossed her legs over the side of the bed and walked to the bathroom, giving Andy a chance to see definitively that, yes, her ass was bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica took in the feel of the warm shower and let out a light coo. Her chest did feel more sensitive, but bigger? He was just trying to be nice. Or he was being a weirdo without trying. Monica was more focused on the fact that, overnight, her nausea seemed to go away and that was enough of a positive to disregard her sudden belly. Placing her hand against it, Monica noticed that it didn't <i>feel</i> like fat. It was tight and firm as it filled her palm. Maybe bloating? Whatever the case, Monica knew she'd been neglecting her exercise for a long time and this was the wakeup call she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around her apartment with her towel half-wrapped around her, Monica called Jodie, who was almost always available by cellphone. \"Jodie, I have a PR campaign I want to try out: to promote our line of sports drinks, EnerG should hold a fitness day or maybe even some kind of fun run. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a good idea, Mrs. Raymond, but I won't be coming into work today,\" Jodie said on the other end, her usual bubbliness all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you still feeling that stomach bug?\" Monica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I feel fine, but...\" Jodie trailed off for a while before finishing her sentence. \"I'm fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a fat day. I can't come in,\" Jodie said, completely serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jodie, listen to me: you are a gorgeous girl. Any man would give his left eye to see you naked with the right. If you gained a few pounds, you're still going to look amazing,\" Monica sighed, smiling a little at her young employee's naivet\u00e9. \"Also, I'm your boss and a 'fat day' sounds absolutely stupid. You're coming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jodie sighed. \"Just...don't make me come from behind my desk too much. I don't want people to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Jodie,\" Monica said, hanging up and rolling her eyes. Andy walked behind his wife and wrapped his arms around her, hands resting against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble at work?\" Andy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just...Jodie being Jodie,\" Monica said. \"I need to get dressed and you need to take a shower. You reek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kissed you on the lips after you threw up last night and you tell me I reek,\" Andy said, shaking his head. \"I see I'm the one doing all the heavy lifting in this relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you bring in the CEO-sized paycheck, then you can say that,\" Monica smiled, leaning back to kiss her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Andy chuckled, giving Monica one last naked squeeze before letting her go. \"Imagine if we had kids. We couldn't have these little arguments in the open anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Monica said with a half-hearted laugh, her mind going back to her dream. \"That's another positive of not having kids.\"</span></div></div>",

As she did so, she passed Yaral Towers, and noticed that the same representative from yesterday was offering free samples of Xpect.  \"Xpect fills you with life!\" she said to each person who took a sample (which was quite a large amount of people), and they cringed as soon as the drink hit their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica decided to approach her.  \"Oh!  Hello, Mrs. Raymond!  Can I interest you in some Xpect?\" she asked.  Monica rested a hand on her slight bulge in her midsection, happy that her jacket covered it.  \"No, you can't.  This stupid drink made my entire office violently ill.  What kind of welcoming gift is that?\" Monica asked, slightly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We apologize for that!  To make it up to you, we'd like to give you all a year's supply of Xpect!\" the Yaral employee beamed.  \"No, alright?  No more gifts!  We're rivals now, got it?  Direct competitors.\" Monica glared, crossing the streets to EnerG Tower.  \"Hope you guys can get your stock back up.  It's a dog-eat-dog world...\" said the representative, her voice dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica entered the building and greeted the receptionist.  \"Good morning, Kathy.\" she said.  \"Morning, Mrs. Raymond.\" Kathy replied, not as energetic as usual.  \"Still feeling bad?\" Monica asked.  \"No.  Just...different.\" Kathy said.  \"Well, I hope you start feeling like yourself again as soon as possible!\" Monica smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Monica got to the top floor, she realized that everyone seemed a lot quieter than usual.  \"Good morning, everyone!  I hope that bug went away for all of you guys like it did for me.  That was the weirdest thing, wasn't it?\" she said, trying to get her employees to lighten up a little.  After a few grunts of agreement, Monica noticed that Todd was in her office, obviously waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Todd?\" she asked, as he closed the door behind her.  \"We have a problem.\" he said bluntly.  \"What kind of problem are we talking about here?\" she asked, slightly concerned.  \"A Jodie problem.  She's been in the bathroom all morning, and Penny thought that she heard her crying.\" Todd replied, taking a bite of toast.  \"I'm on it.\" Monica huffed, walking to the woman's restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica knocked on the stall where she could hear faint sobbing.  \"Occupied.\" the voice on the other end replied.  \"Jodie, it's me, Monica.  It's alright.\" she said.  \"Not it isn't!  I'm fat!  Everyone's going to see me like this!\" Jodie cried.  \"Listen to me, Jodie.  You are NOT fat.  I saw you yesterday and you looked as skinny as a rail.\" Monica said, trying to calm her down.  \"But I wasn't like this yesterday!  I'm fat!\" she said, as Monica could hear the stall door unlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica opened it, and saw Jodie wearing a billowy sundress.  \"See?  You totally aren't fat.  I can't tell at all.\" Monica smiled.  Jodie rolled her eyes and lifted up her dress, revealing a pot belly to Monica.  She could tell that it was just a bit larger than her own.  \"Happy now?\" Jodie asked.  \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, it's happening to me, too.\" Monica said, brushing back her jacket so her paunch showed through her slightly snug button-down shirt.  \"No fair, I'm bigger than you.\" Jodie said, cracking a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few laughs, they left the restroom, as Monica was happy that she was able to find a peaceful resolution.  Monica stood in the center of the office and got her employee's attention.  \"So in case you didn't know, our shareholders want us to shake things up a little bit.  They liked the idea Jodie had of chocolate-flavored EnerG, but I wanted go one step further.  I want to COMBINE some \"out there\" flavors.  Like I can think of one right now:  pickles and ice cream.  I could actually go for some right now, as disgusting as it may sound, but if I could get it in liquid form?  I'm so on board that I'm the conductor.\" Monica said, watching her employees nod their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter trading off some oddly specific ideas, which took roughly an hour, Monica decided to take them all out for lunch.  Taking some time to decide where to go, they headed to the Chinese restaurant nearby, their stomachs growling all the while.</span></div></div>",

It's cultural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we usually share the plates with the whole family,\" said Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Ming, the restaurant's manager and a close friend of Monica's. She was half-Chinese and half-Malaysian, with soft black hair tied into a ponytail, bright, laughing eyes, and thin, cute red tan lips. \"How's it going, Monica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Business is good,\" Monica shrugged, letting out a little laugh. \"And we always thank you for carrying our drinks on the menu. I know it wasn't popular with your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie chuckled back. \"I told them, if we can manage to serve Coke alongside traditional teas, we can live selling EnerG drinks too.\" She let out a little \"oof\" and put her hands on her own round, pregnant belly. \"Speaking of energy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's smile softened as she turned her eyes to her friend's belly. Jackie was eight months pregnant with twins and Monica was, of course, happy for her. Some days, seeing other pregnant women made her a little jealous and sad; other days, she saw a woman with a belly and thought \"thank God that'll never be me.\" But after her dream, Monica felt a twinge seeing Jackie rub her belly \u2014 a curiosity about what it would be like to be pregnant; expecting and waiting for your child to come into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you're all enjoying your food,\" Jackie beamed, looking over the table, hand resting on top of her belly. \"That's always good to see, but I've never seen a group your size finish off so many plates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a little queazy yesterday, so I guess our bodies are bouncing back,\" Penny said, slurping up a big clump of noodles held clumsily in her chopsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's always good to see you all,\" Jackie said, looking at each person's face. \"Although...where's Jodie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jodie...couldn't make it,\" Monica sighed, wiping some sauce off of her lips. \"I think I'll just take one more plate of chicken in that vinegar and pepper sauce. Anyone else want some more to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's inner circle shook its collective head. \"You're the one with the major cravings,\" Todd said, chuckling. \"Not to conjure up any images for you, Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled and leaned in to the table. \"Since being pregnant, I've had all these cravings for Italian food,\" she whispered. \"Don't tell my parents, though.\" As she stepped away, hands rubbed both sides of her belly, she turned back to Monica one last time. \"Monica, could you come meet me in the back for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. It'll take my mind off of the wait for more food,\" Monica chuckled, putting down her own glass of lemon-lime EnerG to join Jackie in her office. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard from the other restaurants in the area that they're starting up contracts with an energy drink company,\" Jackie said, her normally cheery face getting more solemn. \"The drink's called Xpect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect,\" Monica sighed. \"Yeah, we know about them. They keep sending us free samples. It tastes awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's selling,\" Jackie said. \"At least, it's selling in bulk to stores and restaurants. They're...offering pretty good prices, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, Jackie?\" Monica said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents, the real owners of this place, are considering switching over to Xpect instead of EnerG. Your drinks never really sold all that well compared to soda or wine or tea. They say we'd save more with Xpect,\" Jackie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this,\" Monica scoffed, shaking her head. \"They've been out there for...for a day and they're already kicking us out of restaurants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They haven't made up their mind yet and I'm pushing for EnerG,\" Jackie said. \"I just want to keep you up to date on what's happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thanks, Jackie,\" Monica sighed. \"You really are a good friend.\" Jackie hugged Monica, her big belly pressing against Monica. \"And the baby shower's tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" Jackie smiled. \"See you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see you,\" Monica said, walking back to her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\" Todd said, noticing Monica's distraut expression. He'd known Monica a long time and was an expert at reading her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Monica smiled. \"Personal stuff. Now, I'm going to polish off this chicken and then we can get back to work. This is the year EnerG becomes world-famous!\"</span></div></div>",

Andrew Reynolds III was a very successful businessman, who was ruthless in his business practices, often taking over companies that stood in his way from becoming even more wealthy.  He had graying hair, made evident by his white goatee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReynolds Industry was a large corporation that excelled in many things.  Twelve years ago, a girl just exiting college got a job at Reynolds Industry, and quickly moved up the ladder.  A few years later, that girl would marry the CEO's son.  Of course, that girl was Monica.  As Andrew wanted to expand into the energy drink business, he decided to let Monica become the new CEO of their new branch, EnerG, scorning Andy in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Andrew walked into the office, and took a seat.  \"So, son, how's the wife doing?\"  he asked.  \"Monica's doing great.  So am I.\" said Andy, annoyed that his father paid little attention to him.  \"Good to hear she's doing well.  So tell me, Andrew.  How does it feel to have the woman in the family bringing in most of the bacon?\" his father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy clenched his fist and gritted his teeth.  \"Dad, it's the 21st century, it's more than normal for females to make more than males, especially since she's a CEO, and I'm just a salesman.\" Andy said.  \"Hmph.  Whatever you say, son.\" replied his father, putting on a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a brown-haired woman walked in, rolling in a cart of Xpect.  \"Hello.  I'm a representative from Yaral Industries, and we just relocated right down the street!\" she beamed.  \"And...what is this?\" Andrew asked, gesturing to the drinks.  \"This is Xpect, our newest energy drink.  We'd like you two to try it!  Everyone else in this office and in the surrounding offices have already done so!\" she said, handing a can to Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was wearing a skintight dress, and Andrew couldn't help but notice that her stomach slightly protruded from her torso.  Occasionally, she'd stop to rub it.  Honestly, it seemed a little smaller than Monica's stomach had been this morning.  \"Are you going to try some, Andrew?\" his father asked, making him snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I don't think so.  Kinda sick of energy drinks from trying so much EnerG that Monica gives me.\" Andy replied.  \"Well, then.  Suit yourself.\" said Andrew, drinking some of the Xpect.  \"Oh, is your wife the CEO of EnerG?\" the Yaral representative asked.  \"Monica?  Yeah!\" said Andy.  \"Well, congratulations!\" she said, leaving the room.  \"Thanks?\" Andy asked, watching her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy looked back at his father, whose face turned pale.  \"You alright, Dad?\" Andy asked.  \"Gonna...be sick...\" he grumbled, covering his mouth, as he ran out of the office and into the bathroom.  Andy got up and looked at the rest of the office, and saw the rest of the employees making a beeline to the restroom as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alrighty then.  Great way to start the morning.\" Andy said, as the office soon became filled with sounds of people emptying their stomachs.  Andy took a sip of his coffee, waiting for the employees and his father to return.  \"Good stuff.\" he said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chelsea Matthews was exhausted.  It was an early Tuesday morning and she hadn't gotten an ounce of sleep.  Why?  Because she had a very important cheer competition, and she had to nail every single move.  She was a perfectionist that way.  Chelsea was almost midway through her senior year of high school, and she was absolutely nailing it.  At 18 years young, she is the captain of the cheer leading squad, an honor roll student, girlfriend to the quarterback of the football team, and is close to getting accepted into her dream college, Sunnydale University.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was besides the point.  Chelsea's energy was almost empty, and she needed a boost fast.  Walking into Jackson High, she brushed her long brown hair back, when she saw a familiar face.  Michelle Stewart was Chelsea's best friend for as long as they could remember.  They both had brown hair and blue eyes, and had bonded even more with their years of cheering together.  And they were born on the same day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, there you are!  I've been looking all over for you!  Oh, you look terrible--no offense.\" said Michelle said.  \"None taken.  I stayed up all night trying to remember all of the moves for the competition today.  I feel dead.\" Chelsea huffed.  \"Well I have something that might help with that.  Let's go to the locker room.\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the locker room, Michelle opened her locker and pulled out a pack of energy drinks.  The cans were half pink and half blue, and had the word \"Xpect\" on the front.  \"Xpect?  what the hell is this, Michelle?\" asked Chelsea.  \"You know how my dad works for the FDA, right?  Well sometimes he gets products that don't pass inspection that he has to dispose of.  He had a whole crate of them today, so I figured he wouldn't notice if a pack or two was missing.\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fills you with life?  Product of Yaral Industries?  Are you sure this is safe?\" Chelsea asked.  \"Please, it's an energy drink.  All of them are super unhealthy.\" Michelle stated.  \"Fair enough.  Shall we do this together?\"  Chelsea asked.  Suddenly, they were interrupted, and they quickly put the two drinks into hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two girls doing?\" asked a strict voice.  The voice belonged to Ms. Brown, a 50 something English teacher that seemed to be out to get Chelsea since she had started taking her class this year.  She had never been married, and absolutely hated kids.  Why she became a teacher was beyond Chelsea.  \"Ms. Brown, good morning.  We were just getting ready for the cheer competition today.  What are you doing in the locker room?\" asked Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hall duty, Ms. Matthews.  The bigger question, I think, is what is that?\" she asked, pointing to pack of Xpect.  \"Oh, that?  Just some energy drinks...\" Michelle trailed.  \"Energy drinks are banned from school premises, as stated in section 5 line 12.  I'll be confiscating this and turning it over to Principal Howard at tonight's faculty meeting.\" said Ms. Brown.  She picked up the drinks and walked away, giving the two girls a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the coast was clear, a smile grew on Michelle's face.  \"Good thing I brought a spare pack!\" she said, pulling another case out of her locker.  \"All this trouble just for an energy drink, huh?\" Chelsea laughed.  Michelle took two cans out of the pack and opened them, handing one to Chelsea.  \"Bottoms up!\" Michelle said, as the two took a great swig of the Xpect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey let is settle for a minute, and then offered their opinions.  \"It's really sweet--\" \"--but really, really bitter.\" Chelsea finished.  Suddenly, the two began to feel incredibly nauseous.  They darted into separate stalls and began to vomit profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chelsea and Michelle were emptying their stomachs in the bathroom, the rest of the cheerleaders arrived in the locker room.  That included Mary, a stereotypical blonde, Zoe, a dark-skinned beauty who everyone believed would be a supermodel, Abigail, another blonde who happened to be incredibly religious, and Becky, a brown-haired, brown-eyed girl who was considered to be Chelsea's enemy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously, Becky had dated Zack, the school's quarterback.  They went through a rough breakup, and Zack quickly got together with Chelsea, while Becky couldn't find another boyfriend.  To say that she was jealous of Chelsea was an understatement.  But Zack and Chelsea were perfectly happy together.  They got along great, and the two were nominated for Homecoming King and Queen, which was coming up on Friday.  Becky was also nominated for Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are Chelsea and Michelle?\" asked Zoe, looking around.  \"Knowing those two?  Probably late.\" Becky scoffed.  Mary looked in Michelle's open locker, and saw the Xpect.  \"Hey, what's this?\" she asked.  \"Looks like some kind of energy drink.  Wanna try it?\" Abigail asked.  The three thought it'd be a good idea.  \"What about you, Becky?\" Zoe asked.  \"No thanks.  Just give it to Julie, I guess.\"  she said.  Julie was their coach.  She was a short, strict woman, but she really cared about the girls.  Or their chance at winning the cheer competition, to be more accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ran into the restroom to vomit as Julie walked in, just as Michelle and Chelsea returned from their stalls.  \"Morning, girls.  Ready for today?\" she asked.  \"As ready as I'll ever be.\" Chelsea said, flashing Julie a smile.  Although it wasn't really obvious, Chelsea was Julie's favorite of the group.  \"Where's everyone else?\" Julie asked.  \"They all ran to the bathroom after trying this energy drink we found in Michelle's locker.  Speaking of which, wanna try it?\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what were you all doing in my locker?\" Michelle asked.  \"Looking for you two.  We were worried sick.\" Becky said, as some heaving could be heard from the bathroom.  \"Some of us literally sick.\" she added.  Julie snatched the can from Becky and took a sip.  \"That is...not good...\" she mumbled, scurrying to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Chelsea, ready for the competition?\" Becky asked.  \"Well, I stayed up all night preparing for it, so I hope so.\" she responded.  \"Good.  You better not ruin this for us.\" she said.  The ladies returned from their stalls and got their things, heading out to the bus.  It was a bit of a drive, which was why they were leaving before school even started.  As they walked outside, Chelsea saw Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe.  Leaving?\" he asked, pulling her in for a kiss.  In the background Becky watched, scowling.  \"Yep.  Gonna be gone the whole day...\" Chelsea said.  \"Right.  Want me to stop by later tonight?\" Zack asked.  \"I don't know.  I'll probably be tired and I have to catch up on the work I'll miss today.  But maybe.\" she said, giving him a kiss goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea got in the bus and took a seat next to Michelle, the nausea still present as they headed off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cheerleaders were in the locker room of the gym where the competition was held, putting their uniforms on.  They still felt quite nauseous, but they cared so much about it that they had to perform.  Julie approached them, preparing to give them a pep talk.  \"Alright girls, I know that we're all feeling under the weather, but if you all stick to the choreography we can win this.  Ready?\" she asked.  The girls nodded in agreement and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea got in her place, and watched the lights dim low and the music start to play.  She glanced over at Julie, who was standing near a trashcan, in case she got sick.  Chelsea took a deep breath, and the cheerleaders began their routine.  It went well to begin, as they all were able to hit their moves in perfect time.  For their big finale, they had to form a pyramid, with Becky on top and Chelsea, Michelle, and Zoe on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey held their position for a moment, until Chelsea began to feel very sick.  She put her hand over her mouth and ran out of the pyramid, causing it to collapse.  The girls weren't hurt, luckily, but Chelsea hurled into the trashcan where Julie was standing, causing the crowd to gasp.  \"Damn it, Chelsea.  Are you alright?\" Julie asked, rubbing Chelsea's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice rang over the intercom.  \"Due to that unfortunate event, Jackson High has been disqualified.\" it said.  The girls sighed in disappointment.  \"Great job, Chelsea.  Just great.  You ruined it all for us.\"  Becky sneered.  \"Oh, back off, Becky.  I was feeling pretty sick too.  If it wasn't her it would've probably been me.\" said Michelle, supporting her friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.  It happened to Chelsea, so she gets the blame.\" Becky responded.  \"Becky, you need to calm down.  You weren't on top form, either, and you weren't even sick.  So I don't know what your excuse is.  Anyways, let's go back to Jackson High.  We're going to stop at Subway, so get your money ready.\" Julie said, as she headed towards the school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was mostly silent.  \"Alright, girls.  We'll be at Subway in five minutes.\" Julie said.  They saw a McDonalds in the distance, and their bellies collectively groaned.  \"Maybe we could stop at McDonalds instead?\" Mary asked.  \"Good idea.\" Julie said, as they pulled into its parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls got burgers and fries, except Becky.  They grabbed a table and began to chow down.  \"You might wanna watch what you eat, Chelsea, or you might not be able to fit into that Homecoming dress.\" she said, giving Chelsea a sinister grin.  \"Well, at least I'm actually going to Homecoming with someone, unlike you.\" Chelsea fired back, causing the cheerleaders to erupt in a chorus of\"OOOHH\".  Becky sat in silence, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished their meals, and shortly arrived back at school.  \"You all know the deal.  Practice tomorrow and Thursday, football game on Friday.  Hopefully we'll all feel better by tomorrow.\" Julie said, and the girls left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea walked in her house, and saw her father sitting on the couch.  Her mother had died years earlier, and her dad had been scraping by ever since.  \"How'd it go?\" he asked.  \"Not good.  I got sick, and we got disqualified.\" Chelsea said.  \"Oh, I'm sorry about that, baby.  Just get some rest and we'll talk more tomorrow.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.  Good night, Dad.\"  she said, heading upstairs to her room.  \"Good night, sweetie.\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea tried to sleep, but she just couldn't.  Something felt \"off\", and she couldn't quite place what it was.  She walked over to her bookshelf and pulled out an old photo album.  She started at the back, and eventually stumbled upon pictures of her with her mother.  She put a hand on one of the photos, as tear ran down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sound of something hitting her window interrupted Chelsea's moment of peace.  She walked over and saw what the cause of the noise was.  Zack was standing outside, with a rock in his hand.  \"Zack, what are you doing?\" she asked.  \"Trying to get your attention.  I want to see you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't have just sent me a text?\" she wondered.  \"Oh, yeah.  I guess so.  But this is more chivalrous, isn't it?\" Zack asked.  \"Last time I checked, chivalry doesn't mean breaking your girlfriend's window with a rock.  But at least you had good intentions.\" Chelsea noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sneaked into the house and entered Chelsea's room.  \"Whatcha up to?\" he asked, taking a seat next to her on her bed.  \"Just looking at some old photos.\" she said.  There were pictures of Chelsea when she was a baby, with her mother holding her.  There were even multiple pictures of her when she was pregnant with Chelsea.  \"You were a pretty cute baby.\" Zack stated.  \"Yeah, I was.  Wasn't I?\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I would make some pretty kick ass babies.\" Zack said.  \"Yeah...maybe.\" Chelsea responded.  \"Do you wanna...get some practice in?\" he asked.  \"What, have sex?  I don't know...do you have protection?\" she asked.  \"Of course.\" he replied, as Chelsea removed her clothing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms. Brown slammed the case of Xpect in the middle of the table. \"Recognize this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quiet. \"N-no?\" said Mrs. Beverly, head of student affairs at the high school. She was in her early 30s and was a kind-hearted, if not occasionally naive, woman with bushy red hair. Mrs. Beverly had several children of her own and was never shy with her pregnant belly, but swore that she was done having babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you out: This is the big new energy drink with high school kids now. Xpect, it's called,\" Ms. Brown said, taking out a can and showing it to the room. Ms. Brown convened a meeting of the school's four faculty grade leaders. She was in charge of the school's seniors. \"I've already heard of at least four other schools in the city where students have been seen with these drinks. Their recycling bins are full to the brim with the cans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they're recycling,\" chuckled Ms. Lee, one of the school's biology teachers and the grade leader for the sophomore class. Ms. Lee was a short, multiracial woman in her mid 30s with short black hair and a constant sarcastic smile. She was much firmer than Mrs. Beverly, but combined with her relaxed attitude, more students respected her and considered her \"cool\" than almost any other teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really such a concern?\" asked Ms. Goode, math teacher in charge of the juniors. She was leaned back in her seat, trying to hide her cellphone usage, completely bored with the meeting. Ms. Goode was the epitome of everything sexual teacher fantasies are made of: a mid 20s bombshell with long, curly blond hair, big red lips, E-cups always squeezed into a blouse that's too small, and a black shirt paired with enticing leggings. There were even rumors that she'd slept with several different teachers there, but no one could ever confirm this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it?\" Ms. Brown huffed. \"This is about so much more than student code violations. Don't you know why that rule is in place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because energy drinks make children jittery?\" said Mrs. Lopez, first-year class leader and Spanish teacher. She was leaning on the table, one fist against her cheek, staring at Ms. Brown in utter confusion. Mrs. Lopez, in her late 20s, had been at the school shorter than anyone there but had a reputation as a klutz, which endeared her to the school's students. It didn't help that she also had a big, firm rear, smooth brown skin, silky hair, and breasts that rivaled Ms. Goode's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because energy drinks are just the start,\" Ms. Brown said. \"Caffeine is addictive and when it's advertised in such 'cool, flashy' ways, it further compels them to drink it. Then they've got a foot in the door for alcohol dependence. And from there, it's not hard to see them get into hard drugs. This school is not going to produce degenerates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Xpect is a gateway drug?\" Ms. Lee said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You laugh, but just watch,\" Ms. Brown hissed. \"These kids start getting used to being hooked on things now, and a very slippery slope appears before their feet. It'll be bad decision after bad decision. I wouldn't be surprised if the girls end up pregnant before leaving college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not get ahead of ourselves,\" Mrs. Beverly said, holding one hand up. \"Thank you for your...um...presentation, Susan. I don't think this is something serious enough to call an assembly on, for example, but let's all keep an eye out for this 'Xpect' stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we try it too?\" Ms. Goode said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" Ms. Brown scoffed, sitting down with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I still remember being their age. We...I mean...kids smuggled much worse in other types of cans and bottles,\" Ms. Goode grinned. \"If we know what it tastes like, we can catch them in the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, Ginger,\" Mrs. Beverly said. \"Let's all take a can and, you know, have a sip. No harm in that, Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no harm in that,\" Ms. Brown sighed, passing out cans of Xpect to the other four women. They all pulled the tabs and took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an odd taste,\" Ms. Lee said, smacking her lips. \"It's not exactly...oh my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh no,\" Mrs. Lopez said, her face contorted in disgust. \"Are kids really drinking this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not be so old,\" Ms. Goode laughed. \"Just because this isn't a 'classic' taste, doesn't mean-\" She cut herself off as she suddenly dashed toward the nearest garbage can, loudly retching into the bin. The other women took suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof,\" Mrs. Beverly panted, resting one hand on her stomach. \"That's it for this meeting, I think. Everyone get home safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Beverly managed to hold the rest of her lunch inside until she made it to the parking lot and made a mess in the nearest bush. She drove home quickly, her mouth tasting awful and her mind a bit groggy. In exchange, when she got home, she was greeted by the cries of toddlers attacking her shins as her husband, Jim, greeted her in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, your meeting didn't go too long, Megan\" he smiled. \"We were getting hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim,\" Mrs. Beverly said slowly, holding her hand between her breasts as she felt heartburn flare up. \"I just...I feel awful. I'm sorry, can you do dinner yourself tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make dinner?\" Jim scoffed, shaking his head. \"You know I don't do that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, please,\" Mrs. Beverly sighed, slowly walking up her staircase to her room. \"I just can't, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim groaned. \"Fine, we'll go out to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take the kids?\" Mrs. Beverly asked quietly. \"I really need to lie down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" he said. \"Kids, we're going out. Say bye to your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez slid into bed, still embraced by her husband, Roger. \"You're sure you don't need anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, mi amor, you've taken lovely care of me,\" she said, kissing his bare abs. \"Better I don't take anything else before next morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger nodded, giving his wife a slight bow. Roger Miller (Mrs. Lopez kept her last name) gave Mrs. Lopez one last kiss on her cheek before turning off the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not coming to bed?\" Mrs. Lopez asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, dear,\" Roger smiled. \"It's not very late, but I'll try not to wake you when I come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed the door and went back to the kitchen where he was making a dinner for himself, he felt his phone buzz. Seeing the name, he immediately whispered as he talked. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, babe, bad news,\" Ms. Goode purred on the other end. \"I'm feeling pretty shitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" he said, turning his head to see if Mrs. Lopez could possibly hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you might have to cancel that 'business trip' this weekend. It's a no-can-do for me,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veronica isn't feeling well either,\" Roger said. \"Something must be going around at the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be,\" Ms. Goode laughed. \"Unless you gave it to both of us.\" Roger's cheeks turned red, but Ms. Goode hung up before he could respond to her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this sucks,\" she sighed to herself in bed, adjusting her lacy bra. \"Oh well. At least I know this isn't a baby. My dry spell has been going on long enough that I can write 'pregnancy scare' off the list.\"</span></div></div>",

She was on stage in her high school, graduation cap on her head, with the rest of her class lined up behind her. \"I've tried to work hard to earn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see,\" the superintendent chuckled, resulting in laughs from the crowd. Chelsea blushed and looked down. There were two babies nursing at her chest and she was holding them both closely. Luckily, she had a place for them to rest to take off some of the weight: on top of her massive pregnant belly, sticking out bare from under a torn graduation gown. \"Of course, you're not the only one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle waddled on stage next, similarly pregnant and breastfeeding. She reached one struggling hand out to take her certificate. \"Thank you. I really need this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all do,\" Abigail groaned, hands under her swollen belly, looking at Zoe sadly and touching her friend's belly out of sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have time to give a speech while you're here,\" the superintendent said to Chelsea. \"Everyone here is excited to hear you speak. You may not be Homecoming Queen, but there's a big spotlight here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea sighed and nodded, waddling to a podium and leaning into the microphone. Before she got a word out, a tiny moan escaped Chelsea's lips. \"I-I can't give a speech,\" she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Michelle asked, looking at her best friend. \"C'mon, you earned it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't give a speech because...oof...my water just broke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea jolted up in bed, her entire body doused in sweat. She felt her heart racing and she put her hand on her chest, trying to settle her pulse and take deep breaths. Sure, Chelsea had nightmares like anyone else, but never one that felt so real. It was like an out-of-body experience, but she could still remember looking down and seeing a colossal belly hanging off of her with squirming and kicking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a dream, Chelsea,\" she told herself. \"You're not pregnant.\" As she gave her heart a gentle pat, Chelsea noticed something felt a little strange. Looking down and giving her breast a soft squeeze, the reason seemed obvious: her breasts were larger. Significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a cheerleader, it had always benefited Chelsea to have a small chest. Lighter, thinner, easier to move around. Now, Chelsea's bra was digging into her heaving bosom. Chelsea moved her fingers around the sides of her breasts, making sure it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" she sighed. \"I might need...D cups at this point. I guess I hit a puberty growth spurt at the end. Or maybe end-of-year stress is just making me fat.\" Chelsea stood up and walked to her bathroom, turning and admiring herself in the mirror. \"I guess I picked the right place to get fatter in, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering and feeling her new body for the first time, Chelsea dressed in a thick sweater and tried to hide her cleavage with her arms as best she could. The last thing she wanted was questions from her father. She crept to the kitchen table and sat down as her father walked around the room, fixing his own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well?\" he said. Chelsea just nodded, pouring herself a bowl of cereal wordlessly. \"I heard a big yelp from your bedroom around 7. Bad dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a weird dream,\" Chelsea smiled, putting her spoon back in her mouth. She looked back at her bowl, puzzled to see it empty. Even more strange was the astounded look her dad was giving her. \"What are you looking at? What happened to my cereal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate it,\" he said in a monotone. \"You shoveled it in like crazy. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine,\" Chelsea said, scrunching her nose up. \"I still feel really hungry though. Do we have any fruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad pointed to the fridge and Chelsea went to town, eating two apples, some lunch meat, four pieces of toast, and gulped down a hefty swig of orange juice. She reached for the coffee pot on the table, but her father pulled it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've got enough energy for now,\" he said with a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I've got to go soon anyway,\" Chelsea said, planting a kiss on her dad's cheek and running out the door. Around the curb, out of the visual path of the window, was Zack's car. Chelsea tossed her backpack and gym back into the back seat and hopped in the passenger side, giving Zack a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good today,\" he smiled. Chelsea rolled her eyes but Zack kept going. \"No, really, you've got...like a glow in your skin. Are you using some new body wash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drive, Don Juan,\" Chelsea said. She decided to withhold the news about her new chest and see how many more compliments she could get. Chelsea had a sense when Zack saw her significant cleavage, and learned she was currently going braless, he would center all his attention there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was relatively uneventful. Chelsea was glad her nausea was gone, but she still felt a gnawing hunger all day, which made it hard to sit through classes. She didn't seem to be the only one distracted. Chelsea spotted at least two instances of boys walking into one another while gawking at Ms. Goode. To be fair, her top did seem much tighter than usual and as proud Chelsea was of her new breasts, it was clear Ms. Goode had her beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea stopped by the school's office to buy Homecoming tickets and was greeted by Mrs. Beverly's smiling face. \"Oh...Mrs. Beverly...does the student treasurer usually sell these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he said he had to take care of his aunt,\" Mrs. Beverly sighed, her smile never leaving her face. \"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Chelsea said with a small smile. She knew for a fact Sean, the student body treasurer, was smoking next to the library. Poor naive Mrs. Beverly. Everyone seemed to take advantage of her. \"How are you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I suppose,\" Mrs. Beverly beamed. \"I've been having a weird craving for pickles, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Chelsea said, looking over the list of Homecoming Queen candidates on the ticket, not listening to the head of student affairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's a bit odd. I've had pickle cravings before, of course, but...i-it can't be the same thing,\" Mrs. Beverly nodded quickly, her smile quivering a bit. \"Well, have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Chelsea said, leaving the office and heading for the gym for cheerleading practice. Seeing Becky's name on the ballot made her so annoyed and angry. Becky and Zack had a history, after all, and if she was named Queen instead of Chelsea and paired with Zack as king...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Mrs. Lopez gasped as Chelsea walked right into her chest. \"I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine,\" Chelsea said, stepping away a bit dazed. \"It was a...soft landing.\" She blinked in disbelief at Mrs. Lopez's breasts, straining the buttons of her blouse. That definitely wasn't the case yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez blushed at Chelsea's choice of words. \"Well...I've got to be going. Have a good day, Ms. Matthews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea rubbed her nose as she made her way to the gym, changing into her cheerleading outfit and heading out to the rest of the girls. She made it just in time for the beginning of practice, so she didn't have time to chat with Michelle. Or, it seemed, point out how Michelle's chest also went up a few sizes. And Abigail's. And Zoe's. And Mary's. And every other girl on the cheerleading squad. Well, except for Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" Chelsea said, turning to face Julie, who was pacing back and forth in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus. You had this evil little grin on your lips,\" Julie said. \"Now, we may not have done too well at yesterday's competition, but that's all the more reason to put in more work now. We've got some big competitions ahead of us. Now let's move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls put their hearts into the practice, jumping and flipping and making pyramids as quickly as they came back down. Julie's look of mild irritation at the start of practice quickly turned into an impressed smile by the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing work today, ladies,\" Julie nodded, arms crossed tightly against her chest. \"It's not just your moves. You all look so...radiant today. If you were like this yesterday, we would have won easily.\" The girls wiped the sweat from their brow, grinning ear to ear. \"Now go shower up. Good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chelsea and the rest of the cheerleaders left, Julie went to her office, unzipping her baggy windbreaker and letting out a deep gasp, finally letting her huge bosom breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never imagined they'd be so heavy,\" Julie sighed, cupping her breasts. \"Be careful what you wish for, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Chelsea washed off her sweat in the shower, Michelle leaned in to whisper beside her. \"Psst, Chelsea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chelsea said, wiping the soap from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you notice everyone's...you know, bustier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea let out a little laugh as she peered through the little gap in the showers' dividing walls. \"I certainly noticed when I woke up this morning. So it's not my imagination? You're definitely bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle nodded. \"They're heavier too. Like, more than I would have expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\" Chelsea said, soaping her chest lightly. Chelsea never thought she was unattractive, but every now and then she'd spot a girl with large breasts and wonder \"what if.\" Now, she was getting to live it. \"Isn't it weird that <i>everyone</i> has bigger boobs now, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not everyone,\" Michelle snickered. \"Becky looks the same. And the rest of the school does too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about that,\" Chelsea said, blushing. \"Mrs. Lopez's breasts nearly knocked me over before I got to practice. If you thought she was big before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you laughing about?\" Becky said, crossing her arms in front of Chelsea and Michelle's stalls. \"I can hear you two lesbos whispering about boobs.\" Some of the other cheerleaders giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Lesbos,' really?\" Chelsea said as she pulled the curtain away, letting her wet, naked body be seen by everyone else. \"First of all, I didn't realize you were still in third grade, and second, maybe you shouldn't accuse the girl dating the football captain of being a lesbian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, where's your boyfriend, Becky?\" Michelle said, walking out with her towel wrapped around her. \"Oh, that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room filled with a low \"oooh\" as Becky blushed and stormed out. Michelle and Chelsea both laughed and gave one another a small high-five as Chelsea put her towel back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why <i>were</i> you two talking about breasts?\" Zoe asked, a little smirk on her lips. \"It is a little odd for women our age to gossip about that kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I heard you talking about Mrs. Lopez,\" Mary said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea blushed, unaware everyone else heard them. \"I mean...haven't you all noticed?\" She squeezed her new breasts together. \"We're all stacked now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe laughed and nodded. \"I did notice that you all look bigger.\" Zoe was already well-endowed before drinking Xpect, so her growth was a little less noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Abigail said quietly, trying not to look at her or anyone else's chests. \"It's a little...lewd, don't you think? Talking about breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease up, Abigail,\" Mary smiled, patting her friend on the shoulder. Abigail's super-religious upbringing made her stiff sometimes, and only Mary's airheadedness seemed to balance her up. \"It's like my mom said: boobs don't define the woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she say does?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary opened her mouth before closing it, scrunching her nose up. \"I forgot. But it sounded good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as we keep practicing like we did today, it doesn't matter if our breasts are mosquito bites or volleyballs,\" Chelsea said, putting her hands on her hips and standing in front of the girls. \"We can be state champions. Now, who's with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleaders all began clapping before a loud gurgle emanated from each of their stomachs. \"M-maybe we should all get something to eat,\" Michelle said. \"You know, to capitalize on this newly-enflamed spirit of togetherness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Chelsea nodded, hurrying to get changed. As the girls were putting their clothes on, Julie walked in, rubbing her stomach. \"Coach, how about we all go out to eat tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to ask you all the same thing,\" Julie laughed, her own belly gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the local Italian restaurant, the girls laughed and gossiped while chowing down on big plates of food. The chef, at one point, came out to greet the women himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such big eaters,\" he smiled. \"The only woman I've ever seen like you is mi madre, and that was only when one of my brothers or sisters was on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke about that,\" Julie smiled, thanking the chef as he left. \"I don't know about you girls, but I hope I never have kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to handle us pretty well,\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, teen girls is one thing. But babies? Toddlers? Ick. And if I had a boy, I'd have no idea what to do with him,\" Julie groaned. \"Well, at least I'm single so there's little chance of getting one in the oven any time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find a husband one day,\" Abigail said. \"I sure hope I do. He'll do all the work and I'll stay home, taking care of our two little boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want a girl?\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Girls can...get into trouble,\" Abigail said, blushing and turning back to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're alone on that,\" Zoe said. \"I sure as hell don't want a baby. You get all fat and ugly. Who wants that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I want to be a professional when I get out of college,\" Michelle said. \"A baby would only slow me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind a baby, I guess,\" Mary shrugged. \"They seem pretty easy to take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to feed them, cloth them, and teach them how to go to the bathroom, though,\" Zoe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't just...figure that out on their own?\" Mary asked, a small look of worry on her face. The rest of the girls quietly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you ever figured out how to eat and cloth yourself sometimes,\" Becky muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, captain?\" Julie said, smiling at Chelsea. \"Ever think about having a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe with the right guy,\" Chelsea grinned, making the rest of the girls laughs. All except one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go,\" Becky fumed, standing up. \"Besides, I wasn't that hungry to begin with. I want to keep my figure as a cheerleader, unlike the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt we'll all wake up with fat pot bellies tomorrow,\" Julie laughed. \"But thank you for your work today, Becky. Great job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Becky said, storming out of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of the restaurant, Ms. Lee was having a similarly large meal. \"Are you...feeling alright, ma'am?\" her waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just famished,\" Ms. Lee said. \"I don't know what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get another order of...everything,\" Mrs. Beverly said, sitting across from Ms. Lee. \"A-and more pickles in with the linguine next time, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More pickles?\" Ms. Lee said as the waitress hurried away. \"I've never seen anyone eat so many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did,\" Mrs. Beverly sighed. \"Four years ago, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four years ago...\" Ms. Lee thought back until her eyes opened wide. \"You mean the last time you were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mrs. Beverly nodded, biting her lip. \"And if it's happening again...Dana...I think I might be pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

Although Susan Brown still blamed herself for drinking TWO cans of Xpect) After spending an hour puking out her dinner last night, she had the strangest sudden desire for The Ultimate Breakfast at Pancake House. All you can eat bacon, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, toast, juice, the thought of it was already making her mouth water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pulled over and given a rather hefty ticket by what looked like a pregnant police officer, whom Ms. Brown called a \"fat pig\" right to the poor female officer's face, Ms. Brown proceeded to gorge herself on food, having over three helpings, before some fat-in-the-belly waiter accidentally spilled coffee all over her blouse, which caused her to once again lash out on the poor (unbeknownst to her, the waiter, and most everyone else) pregnant man, as her emotions got the best of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt off, she thought, she's never been this emotional before. She had to head back to her small one-story ranch home, and change over to a new blouse, that seems to strain against her breasts which were now much bigger than before, as well as perkier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown's breasts where one of her main concern's today, as at 54, her breasts should not be doing what they WERE doing. She chalked it up as being tired after her strange\u2026 dream last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT DREAM\u2026 She didn't even want to think about it. It wasn't a dream, it was a nightmare. The belly\u2026 All those kids.. The smile on her face..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo that wasn't her. She hated kids, always did. Hell, the reason she became a teacher was to make children's lives miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she loved what she did.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" She said to herself, looking at the clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was late for work. Everything that happened this morning had interrupted her neatly laid out daily schedule. She always did everything correctly at a certain time, and now it was blown all to hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Ms. Brown said \"Now everything is off schedule\" She finished straining to get her new \"assets\" into her blouse and preceded to head directly to work, where everything will be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more pregnancy dreams. No more pregnant cops, no more pregnant women crammed into booths at The Pancake House whom Ms. Brown couldn't keep her eyes off of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing pregnancy related could possibly follow her around for the rest of her day\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day went by in a blur, and given the morning Ms. Brown had, she was thankful for it. The school was relatively quiet and she didn't have much discipline to deal out. She scolded a couple kissing by their lockers, confiscated a student's mp3 dock for playing music too loudly, and caught the usual students scurrying away in a cloud of smoke Ms. Brown suspected wasn't tobacco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Ms. Brown would have made the effort to chase down the students for daring to try and break the rules on <u>her</u> watch. Despite her age, she was quite athletic. In school, Susan Brown filled her schedule with gymnastics, track and field, and spent plenty of time lifting weights. Just like she  was now, Ms. Brown was not much fun to be around as a student so she filled her schedule with as many activities as possible to eliminate free time. That spartan regiment ended up paying off when Ms. Brown found her love in a career of terrifying miscreant high schoolers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could dart down halls with incredible speed and cut off even student athletes, catching them redhanded and startling them at the same time. This left Ms. Brown to grin subtly as she drank up the shocked look on their faces. How could they have expected this unassuming woman in her 50s to hide such physical prowess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, Ms. Brown was still feeling a bit of nausea from the day before. And while her growling stomach was now filled with breakfast, her belly felt...odd. She couldn't put her finger on it but chose to blame that disgusting Xpect drink. With a lack of student crime to sniff after, Ms. Brown turned her attention to Xpect once again. As most of the school was out of the building at the end of the day, Ms. Brown dug through the recycling bins, trying to find other empty Xpect cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing alright?\" Ms. Goode smiled as she leaned in to Ms. Brown's office, where the school's bulldog was looking over empty cans with shaky hands. \"Trying to get a few cents back on those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Goode,\" Ms. Brown said stoicly, adjusting her blouse as she looked back at her colleague. \"I'd expect you to be out by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Ginger,\" Ms. Goode said, rolling her eyes and sitting down in front of Ms. Brown's desk. \"You're the only teacher who only calls others by their last name, like the kids. I slip up in class and call Dana 'Dana' instead of 'Ms. Lee' plenty of times. Things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more comfortable using professional terms,\" Ms. Brown said with a low sigh. \"Is that...what you wore today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Goode didn't need to look down to see what Ms. Brown was talking about. Her bright red lips just grew as she grinned. Ms. Goode was never dressed \"conservatively\" by any means, but now her sweater's neck was down so far, someone could easily reach their hand in between her cleavage without touching a single strand of cotton. And it was so tight, Ms. Brown was sure she could see the outline of her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shrank in the wash and I was running late today,\" Ms. Goode said with a wink. \"Don't tell me you're never late and forget something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown turned slightly pale, embarrassed by the reminder of her tardiness that day. \"F-fine. Why are you still here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Goode leaned back and sighed. \"I'm just waiting on someone. I got a ride from a friend today.\" Ms. Brown's face told Ms. Goode she didn't want to know more. It was clear who Ms. Goode's \"friends\" were. \"And now I'm wandering around an empty school and I'm bored.\" She sighed before smiling and leaning in close to Ms. Brown and whispering. \"Did you hear the rumors about North Danforth High?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like rumors,\" Ms. Brown said, pausing for a few seconds. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fourth of the student body is pregnant,\" Ms. Goode cackled. \"And lots of the teachers too.\" Ms. Brown's face lost even more of its color. \"Crazy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-they need to shape up, that's what I always said,\" Ms. Brown croaked. \"North Danforth has always been lax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine, all those people in one place, getting knocked up,\" Ms. Goode said, shaking her head. \"And things were bad enough when Megan was waddling around with that big fat belly of hers. If all the teachers were like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Mrs. Beverly is planning on having any more children, so you don't need to worry about her pregnancy...bothering you,\" Ms. Brown said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Ms. Goode laughed. \"Still, must be something in the water, huh?\" A small buzz from Ms. Goode's pocket drew her attention away as she smiled and stood up. \"Well, that's my ride. See you tomorrow, Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You as well,\" Ms. Brown sighed as the buxom math teacher left. A few yards from the front of the school, Mrs. Lopez' husband Roger was waiting in his car, looking around anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there,\" Ms. Goode smiled, slinking into the passenger's seat, running one hand down his arm, tickling any bare skin she came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-feeling better, I see,\" Roger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so,\" Ms. Goode grinned, pressing her breasts against his side. \"I know I jumbled up your whole schedule by doing this, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" Roger nodded, gulping. \"So, usual place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my place instead,\" Ms. Goode purred. \"I've got something special prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car lurched forward as Roger's foot fell onto the acceleration peddle, making Ms. Goode cackle loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her office, Ms. Brown couldn't stop looking over the cans of Xpect. They were so strange. There was no nutritional information. There wasn't much of a logo besides the simple \"Xpect\" label. All that the simple can really had was the name of the drink, the \"Product of Yaral Industries\" line at the bottom, and the open-ended \"Fills You With Life!\" slogan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mystery that was gnawing away at Ms. Brown. Her instincts, for once, weren't telling her where to go bust the nearest under-age drinking hangout or how to plan a new way to prevent twerking at the Homecoming Dance. They were saying that this Xpect stuff was the beginning of a much larger problem. And while she didn't like to contact a certain person in her life, Ms. Brown figured there was no other way to get to the bottom of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown looked off into the distance as the bartender placed a gin and tonic in front of her. \"Complements of the man at the end of the bar,\" the bartender with a growing belly said, motioning to a man in a groomed suit at the other end, who's eyes were clearly on Ms. Brown's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't drink,\" Ms. Brown said, pushing the gift back toward the bartender, who took it away and shrugged to the man at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, a young man in a trench coat with short sandy hair took the stool next to Ms. Brown, leaning in toward the bar. \"Didn't think you'd show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who contacted you,\" Ms. Brown sighed. \"Why did we have to come to a bar anyway? It's noisy and dirty and dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's what they do in the movies,\" the man said, sticking a toothpick in his mouth. Ms. Brown sighed and rubbed her eyes, cursing under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant Buckman was an acquaintance of an acquaintance and not someone Ms. Brown particularly liked. But in a few instances, he'd managed to help find out information for Ms. Brown about the local youth culture that helped her inflict some serious fear into the hearts of her students. One of Grant's many downsides was that he had delusions that he was a film noir investigator and acted accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about that,\" Ms. Brown said. \"Do you have any information for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, I'm afraid,\" Grant said. \"Xpect isn't that widely circulated of a drink, it seems. And I can't find anything on this 'Yaral Industries.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Ms. Brown sighed. \"Back to square one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!\" he smiled. \"I looked around that high school you mentioned. Rumors seem to be understating the number of pregnancies over there. And, get this, the students are big consumers of this Xpect stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Ms. Brown said, raising an eyebrow. This drink was as demoralizing as she thought. \"Can you get any more information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to go back?\" Grant said, his voice a little too eager. Grant happened to have a \"soft spot\" for pregnant women, if you will. It impeded the depth of his investigation, in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you'd better focus on my school,\" Ms. Brown said. \"See if anything's suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" he sighed. \"She wasn't a pretty dame, or a nice one, but they understood one another. Not many people left like that. So, I figured, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said, turning back to Ms. Brown as she was getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were narrating out loud again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan Beverly was a good mother and a good wife, she thought. Even when she had a full-time job at the local high school, she carried and raised several children. In fact, she had more babies than she ever really wanted. It was her husband Jim who always insisted on having a big family, to the point where Mrs. Beverly was breastfeeding one baby while she was full-term with another inside her womb. But finally, Mrs. Beverly convinced Jim that, after years of marriage, of her cooking and cleaning and giving him healthy children, she should be able to take a break and not have any more kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was disappointed and said he wanted one more baby, but went along with his wife's one request. Mrs. Beverly was happy to not have any more babies to take care of, as much as she loved her children. And she was happy to not have to waddle around with a swollen belly ever again, going months without sex because, ironically, Jim didn't like how she looked pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you can imagine how nervous Mrs. Beverly was as she walked into the 24 hour convenience store. Her recent nausea and cravings were all too familiar and she had to be sure. Mrs. Beverly went to the pregnancy tests, which were surprisingly understocked. As she reached for her own test, a girl with a hoodie that attempted to hide her own growing belly grabbed a test quickly and hurried to the cashier. Mrs. Beverly did the same, quiet as the teenage girl at the counter scanned her test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to order more of these,\" she said in a bored tone, handing it back to Mrs. Beverly. \"Everyone seems to be buying pregnancy tests nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Mrs. Beverly said with a polite smile, heading back to her car. When she drove home, she heard the cheers and grunts of Jim and his friends as they sat in the living room, watching football. Mrs. Beverly got one break from cooking a week during football season when all of her husband's friends came over to watch the game and eat pizza, wings, and other junk that she'd have to clean up later while her children ate along side them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hon,\" Jim yelled, not turning away from the screen. \"How was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good,\" Mrs. Beverly said quietly as an outburst over an interception cut off any chance she had to go into more detail. She went up her stairs to the bathroom in her bedroom and started drinking lots of water, pacing around the room. A text from Ms. Lee drew her attention away for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;take the test yet?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;just about to&gt; Mrs. Beverly sighed as she typed. &lt;wish me luck&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Mrs. Beverly was able to produce a sample and wet the tiny plastic strip. And her face turned bright white when she saw the little pink + sign appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant,\" she said quietly, turning to look at herself in the mirror. On a closer inspection, Mrs. Beverly could tell her chest had grown considerably since yesterday and her skin and hair were glowing and youthful. She lifted her shirt and rested one hand against her stomach, pressing gently. \"Still flat, but a little firm,\" she said. \"Well, at least I've got time to think this over and tell anybody else. It's not like the belly shows up overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica Lopez paced around her house, wearing a black tank top that managed to hold her new, swollen bosom in place better than any of her shirts or bras. Her husband, Roger, said he had to work late, which meant Mrs. Lopez had the house to herself. Normally, that meant she'd have on music, dance by herself in the living room, eat ice cream straight from the bucket, and/or watch horror movies. All the things Roger didn't really like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, Mrs. Lopez felt differently. Her sudden illness last night, combined with her seemingly miraculous recovery this morning and the \"changes\" to her body made her suspicious. Plus, she'd had incredible and odd cravings all day. The first conclusion she came to was the one she was most afraid of: she was expectant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez didn't have any kids of her own; Roger didn't want any. And coming from a big family, Mrs. Lopez saw first-hand how tricky raising children could be, but deep down, she still wanted a few babies. But with a possible pregnancy scare on her hands, Mrs. Lopez decided to call over her sister Lorenza to give her some pointers. Lorenza had three children, all still toddlers or younger, and was the only one of Mrs. Lopez' relatives who lived in the same city as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just like when they were sisters living in the same house, Lorenza was late. Just like her sister, Lorenza was a beauty with warm eyes, a dazzling smile, glowingly smooth skin, and chestnut hair, only she wore hers much shorter than Veronica. \"Hi sis,\" Lorenza smiled, hugging her sister closely, their equally large breasts pressing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lorenza,\" Mrs. Lopez smiled, sitting down at her couch, crossing her legs nervously. \"Glad you could come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time,\" Lorenza beamed. \"It sounded urgent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez nodded. \"Is there a...way to tell you're pregnant besides getting a test? Are there tell-tale signs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenza's eyes grew wide, but not as wide as her smile. \"Veronica! You're going to have a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez blushed and waved her sister away. \"N-no, I mean, we haven't been trying to. I've just had some funny things going on with my health and it reminded me of mama a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like what?\" Lorenza said, trying to contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-for one,\" Mrs. Lopez said, cupping her breasts. \"I was always well-endowed, but not like this. And I've had nausea and cravings lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still nauseous?\" Lorenza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was just yesterday,\" Mrs. Lopez said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, morning sickness lasts for a while,\" Lorenza laughed. \"I'm sorry to say I don't think you're pregnant.\" She sighed and sat next to her sister. \"I wanted to finally see you with a big belly of your own. You'd look so cute and wobbly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorenza...\" Mrs. Lopez blushed, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the big sister and you've always been so graceful,\" Lorenza laughed. \"We'd all like to see how you'd handle being pregnant. And any child you raise is going to be incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Mrs. Lopez said, rolling her eyes. \"But I'm fine having free time to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I still have fun,\" Lorenza glared, standing up. \"Though not lately. I think there's some kind of bug going around because I was throwing up yesterday too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be it,\" Mrs. Lopez sighed, standing up to show her sister out. \"Sorry to waste your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble,\" Lorenza smiled, hugging her sister one more time. \"Always happy to see you. We should get together again soon.\" After saying their goodbyes, Lorenza went back to her car, throwing her purse into the seat next to her and dropping her keys. \"Whoops,\" she said, reaching around for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to find them easily. They were right next to the can of Xpect she'd finished off yesterday.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chelsea stood in a lowly lit room, surrounded by a sea of students.  A rotating disco ball was hanging from the ceiling, providing the main source of light.  \"Once again give a round of applause to the Homecoming King and Queen, Zack and Chelsea!\" said a peppy, bodiless voice.  Zack wrapped his arm around Chelsea, smiling to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea looked down and noticed her monstrous belly.  She looked insanely pregnant, and the flurry of kicks that released confirmed her thoughts.  Her incredibly tight dress struggled to contain it.  \"Just smile and wave, Chelsea.  Smile and wave.\" Zack said.  Suddenly, she felt a huge pain in her pregnant stomach, and a rush of fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a yelp and hunched over.  \"What's wrong?\" Zack asked.  \"I...think I'm going into labor!\" she shouted.  As if it was on cue, a group of paramedics carrying a stretcher appeared out of the crowd, and Chelsea was hefted onto it.  As she was carted away, she saw Becky next to Zack, as she put her arms around him.  Slowly, the two pulled in for a kiss.  \"NO!  NOOOO!!\" she yelled, her babies kicking wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea woke up, gasping for air.  \"Oh, god.  It was just another bad dream...\" she said, slowly sitting up.  Looking down, she noticed that she had developed a bit of a pot belly.  Chelsea put her hand on the bump, and realized that it was quite firm.  \"What the hell...\" she said.  Her cell phone buzzed, and Chelsea realized that it was a call from Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked.  \"Are you fat?\" Michelle asked.  \"Excuse me?\" Chelsea asked, taken back by her friend's question.  \"A belly? Do you have like a little pot belly?\" her friend demanded.  \"Yeah, I do.  Why, do you have one too?\" Chelsea inquired, feeling the bump some more.  \"Yes!  What do you think it is?  Could we be pregnant or something?  Or FAT?  Oh, god, that's even worse!\" Michelle whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down, Michelle!  We both really pigged out at the restaurant last night, so we're probably still bloated.  Everything's fine.  No baby, no fat.  It'll go down soon, we just have to watch what we eat.\" Chelsea said, hanging up.  Her stomach gently rumbled, causing her to rub it.  \"After I get some breakfast, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering, Chelsea put on a sweater to cover her bump, and put on some jeans.  Or tried to, at least.  It was a very intense battle, but she finally managed to get it buttoned, though it was incredibly tight.  \"Might need to get some bigger clothes after practice.\" she noted.  Chelsea walked downstairs and into the kitchen, where her father was eating toast and reading the daily paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Chels.  Sleep well?\" he asked.  \"Nope.\" she replied, raiding the pantry and refrigerator for food.  \"Ah.\" said her father, taking a sip of his coffee.  Chelsea prepared an amount of food similar to what she had yesterday and took a seat.  She began to devour her food, eating it as fast as humanly possible.  \"So we're doing this again, huh?  Keep eating like this and Zack is gonna break up with you.\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea didn't pay attention to what he was saying, as her main focus was feeding herself.  Her father gave a frustrated smile and put his face back into the paper.  After she finished her meal, grabbed her backpack.  \"Bye, Dad!\" she said.  \"Have a good day, Chelsea!\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack picked her up at the usual place at the usual time, and the two headed to school.  \"Hey.  You feeling alright?\" he asked.  \"Yeah, fine.  Why?\" Chelsea inquired.  \"I dunno, you just look a little...different.  I don't know why.\" he said.  Chelsea nodded, and paused as her stomach let out a growl.  <i>Hungry again?</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you miss breakfast or something?  I could stop and get you a bacon, egg, and cheese or something.\" Zack offered.  \"Yeah, yeah I did.  We can stop if you want.\" Chelsea said, her stomach growling again.  \"Better make that two biscuits.\" Chelsea said, giving a fake laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chelsea finished her biscuits, the couple arrived at Jackson High.  Zack gave her a kiss goodbye, and the two went to their respective classes.</span></div></div>",

Could...could it be Zach's?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's hand rubbed her expanded stomach before realizing someone might see her. Putting such thoughts out of her head, she made her way to her first class; AP Biology. Hunching over, she barely found her seat before Michelle was whispering frantically in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Chelsea, I can't believe this my parents are going to kill me how could this happen I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle!\" Chelsea whispered as loud as she dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Michelle stared back with a blank look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Look, we <b>aren't</b> pregnant\" Her hand rubbed her sizable bump again, \"but even if we are you can't freak out like this. We'll handle it together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Michelle looked off again, \"Although, you would look pretty hot preggo. You've already got the boobs.\" She grinned, eyeing her chest, \"Hey, are they even bigger? No fair!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Maybe. Shut up!\" Chelsea had noticed that her clothes were even tighter around her chest this morning but put it out of her mind. On further inspection, her stomach was noticeably bigger than Michelle's too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late I had a little errand I...Peter put that phone away!\" Chelsea put her freak out on hold as she turned to face Ms. Lee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather you not spread rumors about me, though I doubt many of you would dare anyway. But I'm sure you delinquents have noticed a few...changes that I didn't myself, but here's the explanation: I'm pregnant.\" Chelsea felt her stomach sink. Ms. Lee's bump was smaller than hers as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the lucky guy?\" A voice from the back of the room called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business Peter. But, my...partner has been very supportive. We only found out yesterday and I couldn't be happier. Now that's enough distractions. Open your textbooks to page 576. Now, pregnancy is separated into three trimesters of more or less equal length...\" She turned and began writing on the white board. Chelsea couldn't help but notice that her backside seemed more ample than usual as well. She could only hope that she wasn't getting any bigger down there as well. What made her more nervous was the timing of Ms. Lee's announcement. Wasn't it yesterday that all the cheerleader's boobs got bigger overnight? Pondering for a moment she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Lopez...\" Chelsea said aloud. She had felt her changes first-hand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, she's soooo hot. Even though Ms. Goode's got bigger cans, I still think she's hotter.\" Chelsea turned to find Michelle staring off into space, a dull blush coating her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop? I think whatever happened to us happened to the teachers too! We need to ask the squad at practice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they're bigger too?\" Michelle trailed off, eyes glazing over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you? Stop lezzing out all over my desk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I don't know what's wrong with me. But the last day or so I could <b>really</b> use some release. Don't suppose you could loan me Zach for an hour or so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No I can't loan you Zach for an hour</i>.\" She huffed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you'll have to do then.\" Chelsea stifled a scream as her boobs were grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem.\" The two girls turned to find Ms. Lee's eyes burning holes in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you girls want to share or do in front of the class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then no more interruptions. As I was saying, a common misconception is that gestation is nine months. False, it's actually closer to ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ms. Lee? Why are we learning about pregnancy in AP Bio? And shouldn't we be studying for our exam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the hall Peter. You know which corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man...\" Chelsea stared as the boy trudged out of the room. At least now she had a plan. After school she would talk to the rest of the girls and then...She would get to that part later.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for her, it wasn't long until she saw a student wearing a hat all the way towards the end of the hallway.  She ran as fast as she could, which was a bit more difficult today for some reason, and chased him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you there!  Stop right now!\" she huffed as she finally stopped him.  \"Uh...are you alright?\" the student asked, concerned that she was wheezing so much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to distract me!  You are violating a serious rule by wearing a hat in a school building!  You could be hiding a bomb under there!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Ms. Brown, I'm not hiding a bomb in my hat!\" he said, a little surprised.  \"Well, that's just what a terrorist would say, isn't it?  Give me that hat, and lose that disrespect while you're at it!\" she said, taking his hat.  \"Alright, fine!\" he said, obviously annoyed.  He began to walk away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should lose some weight while you're at it...\" he murmured, though it was just loud enough for Ms. Brown to hear.  \"Excuse me?  Detention!\" she shouted, walking away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown looked down at her midsection and noticed that she did have a slight potbelly.  \"Maybe I do need to lose some weight.  It'd help if I want to keep cracking down on students.  I'll just have to watch what I eat.\" she said to herself, walking past Mrs. Beverly's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Megan, did you find out yet?\" asked Ms. Lee, taking a seat in Mrs. Beverly's office.  \"Yes.  I'm...pregnant.\"  Mrs. Beverly confirmed, while chowing down on a pickle-and-mustard sandwich.  \"But you've already had kids before, is it really such a big deal?\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim and I had already decided that we were done having babies.  And besides...I'm not so sure that this pregnancy is...normal...\" Mrs. Beverly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal?  What do you mean?\" Ms. Lee inquired.  \"Well, I guess it'd be best if I showed you.\" she said.  Mrs. Beverly stood up and revealed her stomach, roughly four or five months pregnant in size.  Her button-down shirt was struggling to contain her swollen middle.  \"Megan...oh my.  Can...can I feel it?\" Ms. Lee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Leslie.\" Mrs. Beverly said, unbuttoning her shirt.  Despite multiple pregnancies, her belly was still stretch mark free, and it was perfectly round.  Ms. Lee examined her belly, feeling its tightness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really are pregnant, huh?\" she asked.  \"I must be.\" Mrs. Beverly replied bluntly.  \"How far along do you think you are?\" Ms. Lee asked.  \"I can't be very far along.  I wasn't even showing yesterday!\" she exclaimed, struggling to button her shirt back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lee leaned back in her chair, her eyes glued on her colleague's visible bump.  She subconsciously put a hand over her own barely showing bump.  \"So do you think you're ready for another baby?\" she asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant with one baby?  Sure.  I've gone through it a bunch of times.  But for some reason...I think I may be having more than one.  But multiples don't run in our family, so I...don't know.  I am going to the doctor's tomorrow after school, so I might find out then.\" Mrs. Beverly concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you told Jim yet?\" Ms. Lee asked.  \"No.  I'm not sure when I'll tell him.  Maybe tomorrow when I find out, but at the rate I'm growing, I'm not sure if I'll be able to hide it from him that long.\" she said, putting a hand on her rounded belly.  \"How is Bianca doing, by the way?\" Mrs. Beverly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's good.  We're good.\" Ms. Lee lied.  Bianca, Leslie's longtime partner, was an OB/GYN.  The two were beginning to have disagreements over one major thing: a baby.  Bianca desperately wanted one, but since she was infertile, she couldn't become inseminated.  Only Ms. Lee could, but she refused whenever it was brought up.  She mainly attributed it to not being ready to be a parent, but she always hid the real reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was deadly afraid of getting pregnant.  Even though her good friend Mrs. Beverly had gone through numerous pregnancies, she was always terrified of giving birth.  Not to mention the morning sickness and getting fat.  Needless to say, Bianca was getting frustrated with Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good.  I'm glad you two are happy.  Now, I'd like to finish my second breakfast in peace.  I'll talk to you later.\" Mrs. Beverly said, munching on the disgusting meal.  Ms. Lee walked out, and thought about her own recent symptoms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lee put her hand on her small, tight bulge that was located in her midsection.  <i>Could I be pregnant?  No, that's impossible.</i> she thought, shaking off that notion as the morning bell rang.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chelsea grunted as she tried to squeeze into her desk. Unfortunately, this classroom only had those awful old seats where the tiny wooden desk was attached to the chair. This made it hard to get comfortable, especially for students with growing pregnant bellies like Chelsea. But for Chelsea, trying to fit in was embarrassing because she thought her stomach was the result of bloating or, worst of all, fat. Still, in the back of her head, there was the fear of a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Zach and I haven't been having sex <u>that</u> much</i>, Chelsea thought as she finally slid into her seat. <i>If he got me pregnant, I wouldn't be showing already...would I</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea wasn't the only one groaning as she tried to sit in her desk. Zoe was the other student from the cheer squad in Chelsea's first period class and she shot her captain a warm smile. \"Guess we had a little too much to eat after practice last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Chelsea blushed, smiling back at the squad's top beauty. \"Julie will just have to push us extra hard today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" Zoe said, rolling her eyes. If Zoe had Chelsea's aptitude for athletics, she would likely be captain instead because of her striking good looks but she disliked exhorting herself more than anyone on the team. The only person who pushed herself less than Zoe in practice was Becky, who was blessed with natural cheerleading talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down, everyone,\" Ms. Goode sighed as she strutted into the room. Every time she entered a classroom, everyone stopped talking. It looked like a modeling shoot, with her long blond hair fluttering behind her, her huge breasts out in front, her long legs walking gracefully, and her face in a sexily uninterested glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, there was something else about Ms. Goode that drew everyone's attention. She always wore incredibly tight clothing so the sizable bulge in her midsection was all too obvious. It was just about as big as Chelsea's, as far as she could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne student raised her hand slowly, too curious about her teacher for her own good. \"Um, Ms. Goode...are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I what?\" Ms. Goode said in a loud, low voice, shooting her blue eyes at the poor girl. In a flash, the calm blue sky of her eyes was now an icy glare. The girl only gurgled, unable to respond as she froze in terror. \"No questions about teachers personal lives,\" Ms. Goode sighed, turning to the board. \"We've got a test in a few days, so if you're all ready to pay attention, I'll begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Goode's inappropriate conduct was well-known by the school's faculty and administration, but she stayed at Chelsea's high school, teaching and even getting the position of junior class leader. The reason was simple: she was a mathematics genius. At only 26, Ms. Goode had a PhD from MIT and her area of expertise was calculus, which she was teaching Chelsea at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes went by and Ms. Goode finally looked over her class, seeing their eyes glazed over. Half of the students were gawking at Ms. Goode, ogling either her breasts which had grown again since yesterday or her adorable \"annoyed face.\" The other half were staring at the series of formulas, proofs, and other calculus demonstrations she'd written all over the board. \"I can see this is over your heads,\" she sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. \"I'm having an off-day, so why don't you all pair up and go over the study guide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea slowly moved to where Zoe was sitting, groaning as she tried to move from desk to desk with the cramped space. She also caught a few students looking at her pot belly and comparing her to Ms. Goode's stomach. Zoe saw her irritation and smiled, leaning in so they could whisper. \"Looks like Ms. Goode pigged out yesterday too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if this is really fat, though,\" Chelsea said, putting one hand against her stomach. \"It's not soft. It's pretty firm, but it's still round. I think it could be gas or our digestion is acting up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did have that nausea,\" Zoe nodded. \"But I don't feel like advertising that fact. I'll lose my reputation if I tell people, 'Hey, I'm not fat. I'm just backed up.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea chuckled and looked over the worksheet, scratching the side of her head. \"We may need Michelle's help with this stuff. She understands things like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can get some boys to give us a hand,\" Zoe winked. Part of Zoe's laziness came from her confidence that her looks could get just about any guy in the school to help her out for no charge. In fact, despite all the practical flirting Chelsea saw Zoe do, she never saw her go out on a date. \"Say, have you been having...weird dreams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea gulped. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if it was a symptom of whatever's happening with us,\" Zoe said. \"I can barely ever remember my dreams but the ones for the past two days...\" Zoe shuddered, crossing her arms. \"They were creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the same thing's been happening with me,\" Chelsea nodded. \"You mean dreams with...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">pregnancy?\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ms. Goode said, standing behind the two cheerleaders, her hands on her shapely hips. \"Just because you're both on the cheer squad doesn't mean you work any less in my class. And don't spread rumors about people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, Chelsea raised an eyebrow. <i>Rumors? Why is Ms. Goode so touchy about pregnancy</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the bell rang and Zoe and Chelsea slowly tried to squeeze back out of their desks as the rest of the class left. While they were trying to leave, Ms. Goode crossed her arms at her desk. \"Ladies, let's hurry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Zoe nodded, flashing a sarcastic smile as she finally got out, pulling Chelsea with her. \"I have a feeling Ms. Goode had a bad relationship with her cheerleaders in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know why,\" Chelsea shrugged. \"By the look of her, she'd have fit right in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the classroom door, Ms. Goode huffed and pressed her hands against her round belly. \"Pregnancy,\" she scoffed. \"I can't believe students are telling one another I'm pregnant...\" But she couldn't completely shake the idea. After all...those dreams last night felt very real.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chelsea was on her way to her Spanish class, but she got called in to Mrs. Beverly's office.  Not wasting any time, she hurried to see what she wanted.  Chelsea walked into the office and saw Mrs. Beverly sitting at her desk.  \"You wanted to see me, Mrs. Beverly?\" Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Beverly stood up, revealing her belly, which was a bit bigger than Chelsea's.  \"Oh, yes!  Homecoming Weekend can go by very fast, so I printed out a schedule for this weekend's activities!\" she said, handing the piece of paper to Chelsea.  \"Cool, thanks!  I'll take a look at this later.\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to say goodbye and leave, but was interrupted by a large rumbling from Mrs. Beverly's stomach.  Her face turned as red as her hair, and she placed a cautious hand on her rounded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry, Mrs. Beverly?\" Chelsea giggled.  \"Y-yes.  Tell me...do you know if the cafeteria is open yet?\" she asked, beginning to rub her stomach.  \"No, lunch starts after this period.  So another hour or so.\" Chelsea said.  \"Oh...oh boy...\" Mrs. Beverly said, her belly continuing to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later, Mrs. Beverly.\" Chelsea said, finally leaving her office.  Hearing the warning bell, she ran to Mrs. Lopez's class, both for the fear of being late and being caught by Ms. Brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea made it just before the late bell rang, and bolted to her seat, right next to Michelle.  She looked at her friend, and noticed that she was wearing a large coat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you wearing?\" Chelsea asked.  \"I've gotta wear SOMETHING to hide this belly!  I don't want people to think I'm a tramp or something!\" Michelle exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as it's not the 1940s, no one's going to call you a tramp.  People use \"slut\" nowadays.  Besides, nobody is going to care, my belly is just as big as yours.\" Chelsea said, easing Michelle's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez sat at her desk, looking at her cell phone.  \"Lo siento, los estudiantes. Estoy esperando una llamada de tel\u00e9fono.\" she said.  As this was an advanced Spanish class, they were able to comprehend the gist of her sentence.  Surely enough, her phone rang, and she hastily picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola? S\u00ed, soy Ver\u00f3nica L\u00f3pez. Llam\u00e9 antes porque creo que podr\u00eda ser ... embarazada. Los s\u00edntomas? N\u00e1useas, el crecimiento del pecho, los antojos extra\u00f1os. Y ... mi est\u00f3mago es ... m\u00e1s grande. Ma\u00f1ana a las seis horas? Eso deber\u00eda ser bueno. Gracias. Adi\u00f3s.\" she said, ending her call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did anyone understand any of that?\" she asked the students.  They all shook their heads.  \"Good.  Now, today we are going to go over some  verb conjugations...\" Mrs. Lopez said, walking to her whiteboard.  This let the students get a glimpse of her stomach, which was pretty identical to Ms. Goode's belly in terms of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what she said?\" Michelle whispered.  \"Only a few words, but I think she was calling her doctor.\" Chelsea said.  \"I wonder what about, she kinda looks pregnant.\" Michelle noted.  \"Maybe that's what she's calling about.\" Chelsea concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the verb that we will conjugate today is \"comer\".  Anyone know what that means?\" she asked.  Chelsea raised her hand, and Mrs. Lopez called on her.  \"To eat?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  Muy bueno!  Now, would you like to do the full conjugation?\" she asked.  \"Sure.  Yo como, tu comes, usted come, nosotros comemos, vosotros comeis, and ustedes comen.\" Chelsea said.  \"Yes! Tu es muy inteligente!\" Mrs. Lopez chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to conjugate verbs, but all throughout the rest of class her stomach rumbled loudly.  She needed to eat, and fast.  The talk of eating must have gotten to her.  Luckily, the bell rang, and Chelsea darted to the cafeteria, not even talking to Michelle.</span></div></div>",

She was a gorgeous girl with everything in the right place and even the most cynical, anti-cheerleader student in the school couldn't help but get an eyeful of Chelsea when she walked by. But today, Chelsea was getting the stares of the student body for just how high her food tray was stacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starved too?\" Mary said as Chelsea sat down with her fellow cheerleaders. And like Chelsea, their trays were all as full as they could be. \"We must have been working extra hard in practice, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail shook her head as she sat next to Mary. Compared to the rest of the cheer squad table, her tray was practically spick and span. \"You still shouldn't pig out so much. It'll only slow us down when we practice today. And besides, Mother always told me girls who act good look good. Eating all this food is going to make us look like slobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you worried about how our tummies have gotten bigger too?\" Mary giggled, leaning back to show the potbelly she'd developed. Abigail's face turned red at the proposition and put one hand over her growing stomach. \"I'm sure it's just gas from when we kept puking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary!\" Abigail whined, looking around before leaning in to her friend. \"Y-you can't talk like that out loud. We're cheerleaders. We have to be classy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't go that far,\" Chelsea laughed as she stuck her spoon into the mountain of food in front of her. \"But she has a point, Mary. We're trying to eat. Don't talk about barfing, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Mary laughed as her eyes followed Zack as he sat next to his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Zack said, kissing Chelsea before smacking his lips and lolling his tongue around. \"Hmm, weird choice in foods today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw all this vinegar and garlic juice on the condiment island,\" Chelsea said, quieting down with embarrassment. \"I-I thought I'd give them a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it tastes better than it smells,\" Zack said. \"Anyway, I wanted to see if there was anything on Mrs. Beverly's schedule that some of the guys from the team could help with. You know, building stages, that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Chelsea smiled. \"You want to help?\" Zack just smiled and nodded. \"But we usually have the theater department do that kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack let out a loud laugh and put one hand on Chelsea's shoulder. \"C'mon, who would you rather want giving you a hand? Those nerds or your boyfriend and his big, strong arms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown put her hand on one of Zack's big, strong arms and gently but firmly lifted it off Chelsea's shoulder. She put one hand on her hips and smirked at Zack. \"You caught me in a good mood when you broke school rules on public displays of affection when you kissed Ms. Matthews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good,\" Zack smiled, trying to use his charm on the school's bulldog. Her eyes glimmered and his smile began to fade as he realized what a bad decision that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my good moods pass very quickly, Mr. Meyers. Unlike other teachers in this school, I am not opposed to giving a student athlete detention. From now on, keep your hands and...the rest of your body to yourself,\" Ms. Brown said. \"And ladies, this quantity of food is hardly-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rumble from Ms. Brown's own growing pregnant stomach cut her off. The cheerleaders, noticing Ms. Brown's belly, stared up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carry on,\" Ms. Brown said in a low voice as she hurried over to the line at the cafeteria. \"Excuse me,\" she growled at the line of students in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Brown?\" Michelle said, newly entering the cafeteria. \"Why don't you use the Administrator Express Line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no such thing, Ms. Stewart,\" Ms. Brown said, rolling her eyes. \"Don't make me reprimand you for teasing a faculty member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mrs. Beverly used the line when she cut ahead,\" Michelle said, pointing over to Mrs. Beverly. She was eating at a furious pace, stacking up two lunch trays as high as Chelsea had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh,\" she moaned quietly as her stomach continued to rumble. \"I know you're not big enough to hear me or kick around yet, but I need you to be a little more secretive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan?\" Ms. Goode said with a smile as she walked by. \"Don't talk to your food too much. Susan might even give you a citation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, sorry,\" Mrs. Beverly blushed, trying to slow down her meal. But before she turned back to her tray, she saw that Ms. Goode's usual tight sweater was even tighter today. Plus, the usual light lunch of phallic-shaped foods she preferred was a smorgasbord. And of course, there was Ms. Goode's growing belly. \"Are you...feeling alright, Ginger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Goode's usual sexy veneer faltered a bit at the question. \"I'm always alright, Megan.\" She marched over to a distant table and sat down, chowing down viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola,\" Mrs. Lopez sighed as she sat next to Mrs. Beverly, her portion also surprisingly large. \"How are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hanging in there,\" Mrs. Beverly said with a small laugh. \"One of those days, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez nodded before dropping her voice to a whisper. \"Can I ask you some personal questions?\" Mrs. Beverly nodded and leaned in close. \"Was it...hard to keep teaching when you had your first baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Beverly laughed quietly and sighed. \"My husband wouldn't let me work when we had our first child. He's...traditional and he had me stay home and take care of the baby, and when I got pregnant again...well, let's just say that I couldn't work again for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if your husband were more...flexible?\" Mrs. Lopez asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, and if I hadn't kept getting pregnant,\" Mrs. Beverly laughed, placing one hand on her belly. \"Veronica are you...trying to have a baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez cleared her throat before whispering extra quietly. \"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Beverly turned pale. \"W-why would you ask that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned being pregnant and put one hand on your stomach. Besides, you're...looking a little big,\" Mrs. Lopez said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...tell anyone,\" Mrs. Beverly replied in a similar whisper. \"Only you and Dana Lee know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can you keep a secret too?\" Mrs. Lopez said. \"I think I might also...have a baby on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Beverly's jaw dropped as she smiled. \"Veronica, that's terrific!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I'm a little excited too,\" Mrs. Lopez said, standing up to walk around to the other side of the table as she carried her tray. \"But until I know for sure, I don't want anyone to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she finished her sentence, Mrs. Lopez slipped on some mashed potatoes that spilled off of her own tray and spun around, her food falling to the ground. As she stumbled, her shirt \u2014 already extremely tight \u2014 snapped up, showing her entire round belly and her bra on top. On the ground, she let out a sigh and rubbed her stomach quickly. \"I'm just glad I didn't fall and hurt the baby,\" she said, looking back at Mrs. Beverly. When she saw her co-worker's shocked expression, she turned back and saw the entire cafeteria staring at her rubbing her bare, pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the secret's out,\" Mrs. Beverly said quietly.</span></div></div>",

She hurried to her car, in order to avoid conversation, and made her way to the doctor's office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she had to call her husband, Roger.  After a few rings, he picked up.  \"Hello?\" he asked.  \"Hey, baby.  It's Veronica.\" she said.  \"Hey, how was your day?\" Roger asked.  \"It was...eventful.  Listen, I'm going to be a little late getting home, I have to grade some papers.\" she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's okay.  I have a...meeting so I'll probably be a little late getting home as well.  I'll talk to you later, okay?\" he said.  \"Yeah.  Talk to you later.\" she said, noticing that she had arrived at her destination.  \"Alright, time for the moment of truth.\" she said, slowly rubbing her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, a nurse called Mrs. Lopez's name, and took her to an examination room.  \"Could you step up on the scale for a moment?\" the nurse asked.  Mrs. Lopez obliged, and watched in shock as the nurse continued to slide the weight to the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're now at 175 pounds.  It looks like you've gained about...twenty five pounds since the last visit.\" the nurse stated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was my last visit again?\" Mrs. Lopez asked, still surprised at her weight's sudden skyrocket.  \"Two months ago.  Anyways, Dr. Hernandez will be with you shortly.\" she said, exiting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Dr. Horatio Hernandez burst into the room.  He was a confident, handsome man in his late 40s, but looked younger.  \"Doctor Horatio Hernandez, HH Phd, at your service.\" he beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Dr. Hernandez.  Nice to see you again.\" Mrs. Lopez said.  \"You too, Veronica.  But if you want some advice, you might want to lay off  the chimichangas.\" he chuckled, giving her round belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, I don't think this is weight gain.  I think I might be...expecting.\" she said.  \"Oh, well let's give you an ultrasound to see if you're right.\" he said, walking out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned with an ultrasound machine, and Mrs. Lopez lifted up her shirt, allowing him to squirt the cold gel on her swollen bump.  \"Frio! Frio! Frio!\" she exclaimed, noting just how frigid the gel was.  \"I probably should have given you a warning.\" he said, maneuvering the want across her round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so it looks like you're about three months pregnant.  Weird, we didn't pick that up at your last appointment...\" he trailed.  \"Three months?  You mean I'm going to have a baby in six months?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not just one baby, you're going to have...seven.\" Dr. Hernandez stated.  Mrs. Lopez's eyes widened in shock.  \"Dios mio...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Lopez returned home and noticed that Roger wasn't there.  She walked inside, one hand on her belly, the other burying her face.  \"Pregnant.  With septuplets...\" she said, still in disbelief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica needed someone to talk to.  Someone she was close with.  Someone who had gone through a pregnancy before.  She needed Lorenza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer younger sister arrived at her house, letting herself in.  Veronica was in the kitchen washing dishes from an earlier meal, her back turned from Lorenza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to talk, Veronica?\" she asked.  \"Yes, I have to tell you something.  Lorenza...I'm pregnant.\" she said, turning around to reveal her swollen stomach to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were right!  Oh, I'm so happy, you're going to get so big and wobbly!\" she laughed, rubbing her sister's pregnant belly.  \"But you weren't even showing yesterday.\" Lorenza noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm growing a bit faster because I'm having septuplets...\" Mrs. Lopez said.  Lorenza's eyes widened.  \"Seven?  Wow, you're going to get huge!  You're going to be like Octomom, just like, one less.  So how far along are you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor said about three months.\" Veronica said.  \"Alright.  I'm not exactly sure, but I think we might be going through a pregnancy together!\" Lorenza said, rolling up her shirt to reveal her own slight bump.  The two screamed with glee and pulled in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, Roger was in the car with Ms. Goode outside of her apartment.  \"Listen, Ginger, you're really, really great in the sack, but I'm just not comfortable with THAT in the way.\" he said, pointing to her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?  You won't fuck me just because I've put on a little weight?  You misogynistic asshole!\" she said, getting out of the car.  \"Wait, baby, baby, I didn't mean it!  Forget I even said it!\" he exclaimed, realizing that he made a huge mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not going to work this time!  Don't call me!  Oh, and congrats to you and your wife about the baby, by the way!\" she yelled, entering her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger paused.  \"WAIT, WHAT?!?\"</span></div></div>",

Grant had another five minutes before she got fed up with waiting and left. Normally, a stuck-up woman like Ms. Brown would wear a watch, but she made sure to always have the most up-to-date smart phone of multiple brands on her person. If she wanted to be an effective policing force in the high school, she needed in do more than just follow students around. She had to get in their heads, understand what sick things made them tick, figure out what, with the use of these infernal devices, they were capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow came closer to the streetlight Ms. Brown was standing under. Not sure who it was, Ms. Brown lowered her hips, letting out a little groan as her belly added new weight to the lower half of her body. Tightening a fist, Ms. Brown pulled her elbow back as a man in a large trenchcoat slowly walked backwards to Ms. Brown, looking around shiftily. As soon as he turned around, Ms. Brown threw a punch to his solar plexus, making Grant double over as he gripped his chest and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, Jesus! It's me,\" he wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be too careful,\" Ms. Brown said with a little smile, suspecting it was Grant all along anyway. \"Why did you have us meet like this anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant wiped a few strands of hair out of his face and took a deep, painful breath as he tried to regain his \"movie detective\" look. \"It's the best way to talk about sensitive information, doll.\" Ms. Brown raised her fist again and Grant cleared his throat. \"I-I mean, Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Ms. Brown sighed, crossing her arms. \"So, your investigation into high school pregnancies has resulted in the uncovering of some criminal underworld and now your life is in danger, just like in one of your stupid movies.\" She chuckled. \"So, who's after you? The mob? Some biker gang that runs illegal, untaxed diapers? The Yamaguchi-Gumi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want my help, you don't have to get it,\" Grant said, removing a file from under his coat. \"Good luck snooping around on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Ms. Brown said, feeling a rumble of hunger in her growing belly. \"Let's make this quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I looked into this 'Xpect' drink further. The FDA don't know anything about it. Or the European Food Safety Authority. Or the Japanese Ministries that would look into these kinds of things,\" Grant said, flipping through his file. \"This stuff is totally unregulated and there's not so much as a footnote about Yaral Industries in any of these organizations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown shuddered. \"I felt lousy after drinking it, so no wonder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd go to the doctor tomorrow if I was you,\" Grant said. \"But I don't have any evidence of it being too hazardous. All I've noticed is where Xpect goes, pregnancy follows.\" Ms. Brown turned slightly pale at this reminder. \"So it might be an aphrodisiac, or it could lower inhibitions, or increase fertility in some way. It's all very curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep up the good work,\" Ms. Brown said, handing Grant a small piece of paper. \"Next, I want you to look into some employees at my school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant looked over the paper. Megan Beverly. Ginger Goode. Leslie Lee. Veronica Lopez. Chelsea Matthews. \"Are these...a new investigation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of the same one I asked you to work on,\" Ms. Brown said. \"They've all come into contact with Xpect too so see if anything's changing about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they're pregnant?\" Grant said, blushing a little. This assignment didn't require him to interact with any pregnant women yet (as far as he knew) and he was looking forward to getting to feel some bellies. After all, Scott Tracer got to sleep with his subjects every now and then in his detective stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me know,\" Ms. Brown said, stepping out of the streetlight. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the small, secluded area Grant wanted to meet in, Ms. Brown's breathing became heavier and more panicked. Ever since drinking Xpect, she'd been seeing pregnancy everywhere. And when she saw the larger bellies at the school, she thought it was just part of her paranoia. But seeing women eat with such ferocity and with bellies and breasts that came out of nowhere, not to mention what Grant had told her about other schools in the area, she had to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what also worried Ms. Brown was the fact that she'd drank Xpect as well. \"I think I'm at least risk,\" she said to herself with a chuckle. If Xpect was responsible for these pregnancies by making women more likely to engage in unprotected sex, she didn't have to worry about getting knocked up anytime soon. She didn't exactly have a lot of gentlemen callers waiting at her doorstep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she knew the school had a reputation to protect and she couldn't let an outbreak of teen pregnancies happen on her watch. Ms. Brown needed to find the source of all this Xpect trouble and cut it off at the roots. Another rumble from her stomach made Ms. Brown place her hand against her rounding middle and rub it ponderously. She'd also been growing a belly, which she couldn't deny. And that was the source of another wave of considerable concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant didn't have such a bad idea by suggesting a doctor's appointment,\" Ms. Brown said as a car pulled up beside her. The window rolled down and Ms. Lee stuck her head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Brown? What are you doing out here all alone?\" she asked her colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just going for a walk,\" Ms. Brown lied, before her stomach growled again. \"Although I suppose I should be getting back. I haven't had any dinner yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could take her with us,\" said Ms. Lee's passenger, smiling. \"I haven't gotten the chance to meet many of your co-workers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lee sighed. There was a big difference between Mrs. Beverly and Ms. Brown when it came to an entertaining evening, but she couldn't exactly leave Ms. Brown out here by herself. \"S-sure. Get in, Susan.\" Ms. Brown crawled into the backseat and turned to Ms. Lee's passenger. \"This is my...friend, Bianca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Bianca smiled, reaching out to shake Ms. Brown's hand. Bianca was around the same as as Ms. Lee and had long, wavy almond hair and a strong British accent, which bothered some people while curling Ms. Lee's toes. \"What subject do you teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in charge of discipline,\" Ms. Brown said in a monotone as she sat back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Bianca said, trying to keep her smile. \"Well, Leslie doesn't complain about her students too much, so you must be doing a good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Ms. Brown said curtly again, her hand resting against her tightening middle. \"Ms. Lee, let me tell you where to turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Ms. Lee said, clearing her throat. \"We were about to go out to eat and...would you want to...join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brown let out a low sigh, not wanting to appear rude. \"Sure. That would be...nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca smiled and wiggled her fists a little, the only person in the car who was happy with the night's dinner arraignments. </span></div></div>",

Becky hoisted Chelsea up and Chelsea's whole body trembled as she tried to balance on one leg. It didn't help that Becky's hands and arms were shaking and dipping as she tried to support the head cheerleader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it steady!\" Chelsea cried out, looking down at Becky for a second before the fear of falling made her snap her chin back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Becky growled through clenched teeth. Next to them, Michelle was trying to hold Zoe up, and while she was struggling, she was having much better luck than Becky. And next to her, Mary was supporting Abigail, who was flailing even more than Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't stay up,\" Abigail wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Mary smiled through her pain. \"You've got it. I'm right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, straighten up,\" Julie said, pacing back and forth as she watched each cheerleader. \"Keep those arms up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no good. Chelsea fell and took Becky down with her, pining her brown-haired rival against the gym's soft padding. Zoe hopped at the last second and managed to strike the right fall into Michelle's arms. Abigail was less lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" she shrieked as she fell, but Mary side-stepped her and caught the timid cheerleader in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Mary smiled as she and Abigail looked at one another. \"I told you I'm be here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail's face turned red as she looked away. \"Y-you can put me down now, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Julie sighed as she walked up to the cheerleaders. \"You were all on fire yesterday. Becky, you and Chelsea always nailed moves like that. What's the difference today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's too fat now!\" Becky said, turning to look at her teammates. \"You're all too fat!\" Even though Becky was only looking at the cheerleaders, in her mind, Julie was included in this. The cheerleading uniforms were all strained and stretched with the growing bellies of the five women. And even though Julie was wearing a thick, black tracksuit, the increasing roundness of her stomach was still evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just some bloating,\" Michelle said, stepping between Chelsea and Becky. \"It's from when we got nausea a few days ago. We're not 'fat,' Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want to call it, you're too heavy to lift anymore,\" Becky said, crossing her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a point,\" Julie said, nodding. \"Until you can all get your weight in order, Becky, you'll be the one in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Julie, we've been practicing the other way forever,\" Chelsea protested. \"And if we're making changes to that, what else will we have to move around in our routine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which brings me to my next point,\" Julie sighed, placing her hand on her belly for a moment. \"Becky is the new top of the pyramid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's heart sank. She'd always prided herself on not only being the team captain, but having the spotlight on the top of the pyramid. Now Becky would be the one stepping on her back as she struggled to support her. Michelle saw her friend's pain and put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that'll have to be it for today,\" Julie said, looking at her watch. \"Ladies, try to lose some weight...or get some muscles like Ms. Stewart here. Nice job supporting Zoe, Michelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sighed as the six women headed for the locker room, undressing and showering. No one wanted to talk because they were too busy rubbing soap and water over their growing bellies, wondering why they were getting so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a while, the gossiping started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, Abigail,\" Mary said, peaking her head into Abigail's stall. Abigail yelped and covered herself with her arms. \"Have you been having any weird dreams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dreams?\" Abigail asked, her face as red as could be. In fact, she had. All of Abigail's dreams involved her, extremely pregnant, and in the arms of another pregnant woman as they kissed and stroked one another's swollen womb. When Abigail woke up, one hand was under her underwear. She didn't dare tell anyone, let alone her parents. They'd made her repeat enough Bible passages about why it's bad for girls to touch themselves and they were barely comfortable with her cheerleading attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've had these weird dreams the past few nights,\" Mary said. \"About being pregnant, of all things. Crazy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail gulped. \"I-I think all women get dreams like that. It's part of our natural inclination to be mothers, of course. It's the way things should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Mary said. \"I never thought about it like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other stalls, Becky was whispering to Zoe. While the two were far from friends, Zoe tolerated Becky more than any of the other cheerleaders did. \"C'mon, tell me. Did you all start some weird new diet? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Zoe said. \"But I don't think we're the only ones. Ms. Goode was looking a little plump today too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure she didn't just get implants again?\" Becky scoffed, playing off of the popular rumor that the reason she was so curvaceous in the first place was thanks to plastic surgery. In fact, Ms. Goode was 100% natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless they were in her stomach, no,\" Zoe said. \"And Mrs. Beverly looks kind of round too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that's Mrs. Beverly,\" Becky said. \"She has babies like it's a contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's hid this one long enough, then,\" Zoe chuckled. \"I haven't noticed her being this big until just recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumors about Mrs. Beverly's pregnancy were also being discussed by Chelsea and Michelle as they peaked into each other's stalls. \"I thought she stopped having babies,\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, clearly,\" Chelsea said. \"She hasn't been pregnant since we were in 9th grade, but before we got here, she would get pregnant nearly every year, I heard. So is it that crazy that she'd get pregnant again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not,\" Michelle shuddered. \"I can't imagine having that many kids. All the messes, all the noise. Plus, what must your vagina look like after all those babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the imagery,\" Chelsea sighed, before leaning in. \"And, do you remember what Mrs. Lopez was talking about in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the phone, you mean?\" Michelle said. \"She was talking kind of fast, but it sounded like she was on the phone with a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my Spanish was better,\" Chelsea nodded in response. \"You think she could be pregnant too? She has also been getting...you know.\" Chelsea mimed a round belly, but accidentally just traced her own, which made her cheeks flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, just because one teacher's pregnant doesn't mean all us chubby women are pregnant too,\" Michelle said, seeing the distress in Chelsea's eyes. \"C'mon, we're fine. Besides, you and I are just as round and I'm definitely not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea let out a small laugh and nodded. \"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" They left the shower and started toweling off and Chelsea leaned in again. \"Hey, can you teach me how to lift another cheerleader? It looks like I'll need some practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time,\" Michelle smiled as she opened up her locker. \"But no one's easier to lift than Zoe. That girl's like magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Becky will be easy too,\" Chelsea smirked. \"She's full of hot air.\"</span></div></div>",

My mom is making lasagna tonight, and I was wondering if you'd join us?\" she said, nervous for her friend's response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble from her stomach gave Mary the answer.  \"I'd love to!  I'm pretty hungry, and I'm sure that my parents wouldn't mind.\" Mary said, flashing Abigail a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took separate cars, and entered Abigail's house at the same time.  Once inside, she introduced Mary to her parents.  \"Mom, Dad, I'd like to introduce you to my friend Mary.\" she said, as they greeted her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, biblical, I like it!\" her mother said, her voice tinged with a country twang.  She was a small woman with blonde hair and blue eyes, just like Abigail.  Her father, however, was a burly, intimidating man.  \"Nice to meet you, Mary.\" he said in a deep, booming voice.  The four sat down to eat, and Mary and Abigail obviously ate the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long have you two known each other?\" Abigail's mom asked.  \"Since freshman year, right?\" Mary asked Abigail, who nodded in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a boyfriend?\" she asked.  \"Me?  No.  Just...focusing on school.\" Mary responded.  \"Not a bad idea.  We keep pestering Abigail here to find someone.  And it's okay if you get intimate with him, but just use protection, alright?  I don't want you to end up like that Fisher girl across the street who got pregnant and dropped out of high school.  And besides, everyone knows that having a baby out of wedlock is a sin.\" she stated bluntly, eating a bite of lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, mom.  I don't even have a boyfriend...\" Abigail laughed nervously.  The rest of the meal was uneventful, but afterwards Abigail and Mary headed to her room to work on homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I am STUFFED!  Tell your mom that she's a great cook.\" Mary said, lifting her shirt to rub her swollen stomach.  \"I will.  Do...do you think we're...pregnant?  I mean, the nausea, the cravings...THIS.\" she said, poking Mary's exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?  When was the last time you had sex?\" Mary asked.  \"Um...never.\" Abigail blushed.  \"Yeah, me too.  Unless biology has changed, we can't get pregnant if we haven't had sex.\" Mary said.  \"I guess you're right.\" Abigail said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mary leaned in and kissed Abigail.  After a moment, Abigail jerked back.  \"What, what are you doing?\" she asked.  \"I..I thought there was something between us...\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, I'm sorry, but I can't do this!\" she exclaimed.  \"Why not?\" Mary asked.  \"Because, I'm a good Christian girl!  I think you should leave.\" Abigail said, tears filling in her eyes.  \"Alright.  I'm sorry.\" Mary said, leaving the house, even though she knew that Abigail had feelings for her.</span></div></div>",

She tossed the ball of wrappers into a nearby trash can, missing and hitting the rim instead. \"I guess I know why I'm a cheerleader and not a basketball player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're plenty talented,\" Chelsea giggled, walking alongside her friend as she struggled to bend over with her belly in the way. \"And I've been really hungry lately too. Must be our bodies bouncing back after that nausea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As happy as I am to feel healthy again, I could do without the constant cravings,\" Michelle said, picking up her trash and dropping it in the can. \"Just look at me. In no time, I'll be a cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've certainly got the udders for it,\" Chelsea laughed again. Michelle blushed and closed her jacket to try and hide her breasts. \"Hey, I'm only teasing. I've gotten bigger too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are everyone else on the team,\" Michelle sighed, putting one hand on her rounding belly. \"But don't you think this is, you know, different than just fat? Feel how firm my stomach is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea put her hand on her friend's pregnant belly and pressed gently. Michelle didn't realize how sensitive her bump was until now and bit her lip to resist yelping, but Chelsea nodded and removed her hand before it got too sensual. \"Mine too. It must be bloating or something like that. You think we should go to the doctor or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little early for that,\" Michelle sighed, touching her belly before blushing and stuffing her hands in her pockets instead. \"You're not still thinking about the p-word, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's face turned red now. \"It's just weird having teachers with babies on the way around us. And it's not like Zack and I have been celibate, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle cleared her throat and nodded behind Chelsea. The star cheerleader turned around and saw her football captain boyfriend walking toward them, a big smile on his face. \"Hey there,\" Zack smiled, kissing Chelsea on the lips and wrapping one hand around her waist. When his hands felt how much larger her ass had gotten, he paused for a second, turning his head to see if his suspicions were right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, over here,\" Chelsea said, holding his chin and turning Zack back to face her. \"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Zack said, walking toward his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if we get something to eat on the way?\" Chelsea said. She turned and saw Michelle weakly smile. \"A-and can Michelle come along? Practice was pretty intense today and we're both really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay,\" Zack nodded, grinning. \"Anything for my homecoming queen.\"</span></div></div>",

My dad doesn't really care about those types of things.\" Chelsea said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.  Are we just going to pick you up after or do you have a date?\" Zack asked Michelle.  \"No, I don't have a date.  Being the third wheel is my specialty.\" Michelle laughed.  They finished her conversation, and Chelsea returned home shortly after eleven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside the house, she noticed that her father had gone to bed.  Luckily for her, he had left some tacos from dinner out for her in the kitchen.  Still ravenous even after her meal, Chelsea inhaled the tacos at an unprecedented rate.  She stifled a yawn, and decided to call it a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea removed her clothes, and observed her growing form in the mirror.  She placed a hand on her round bump, and observed it's tightness.  \"I really hope this goes down by tomorrow.  Otherwise...no, there's no way...\" she trailed off.  Chelsea put on some pajama pants and a t-shirt, which was quite snug, and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first night in some time, she didn't have any dreams.  Chelsea opened her eyes groggily, and realized that she was running a bit late for school.  For some reason, she struggled to get up, but finally was able to.  Her eyes instinctively darted to the mirror, and she immediately gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was larger than before, as she looked like a woman six months pregnant.  Her t-shirt was now too small, revealing a decent part of her belly.  \"Oh, god.  I look...pregnant.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea placed a hand on her stomach, rubbing it slowly.  Then she felt it.  A fluttering from within her stomach, like there were butterflies trapped inside.  \"Nononono.  This is just bloating.  Really, REALLY bad bloating.\" she told herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea showered and got dressed, putting on the largest sweatshirt she could find.  Unfortunately, the curves of her pregnant belly were pressed tightly against the fabric.  \"Maybe, because all of the teachers are pregnant...people won't even look at me...\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, her father had already left for work, so she quickly whipped up breakfast and headed to school.  Chelsea arrived before first period began, so she figured that she might as well make a visit with the school's nurse, Ms. Stevens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Stevens had been the nurse at Jackson High for twenty years, and had earned a sterling reputation for her loving and gentle care.  Because of this, many students visited her throughout the day, often times not even needing a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the nurse's office arms wrapped around her belly, and saw Ms. Stevens.  \"Chelsea Matthews, it's been a while!  How are you?\" she asked, in her usual cheery voice.  \"I'm doing alright.  Actually...I think I might be...pregnant.\" she said, her voice lowering on the final word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?  You?  No...\" she uttered in disbelief.  \"It's true.  I mean, look...\" Chelsea said, removing her hands from her belly.  \"Oh, dear.  How long have you been hiding this?\" Ms. Stevens asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a few days.\" Chelsea replied.  \"Well, even for a few months pregnant, you still look a little big.\" she said.  \"No, not months.  Days.\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Days?  I'm sorry, but there's no way you could be this big and only be a few days pregnant!\" Ms. Stevens said.  \"Well, do you at least have a pregnancy test that I can use?\" Chelsea asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had any left, I'd give one to you, but they've all been used by some of the students and faculty.  But I can give you a brief examination just to try to figure out just what we're dealing with.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instructed Chelsea to lie down on a table, and lifted up her sweatshirt.  Ms. Stevens felt around Chelsea's swollen stomach, observing its tightness.  \"Well, it certainly FEELS like a pregnant belly...\" she noted.  \"I guess it does...\" Chelsea added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you felt any movement, by chance?\" she asked.  \"I think I felt...a little something this morning.\" Chelsea responded.  Ms. Stevens brought out a stethoscope, and pressed it against Chelsea's pregnant belly.  \"Hmm...\" she said, as she maneuvered the stethoscope around Chelsea's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Chelsea asked, concerned.  \"I might have heard something moving in there.  When was the last time you ate?\" she asked.  \"A few minutes ago.\" Chelsea answered.  \"It might have been digestion, but I'm fairly certain you're pregnant.\" Ms. Stevens revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea gasped.  While she assumed that it was the case, she was still surprised to hear that it was all but confirmed.  \"So what am I gonna do?\" Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm close friends with a nearby OB/GYN.  I'll get you an appointment tomorrow morning.  Don't worry about price, I'll pay for it.\" she responded, patting Chelsea's bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...that means a lot.  Do you have any idea how many might be in there?\" she asked.  \"Impossible to say.  Could be one.  Could be...more than that.  I guess you'll find out tomorrow, right?\" Ms. Stevens said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea rolled down her sweatshirt and thanked Ms. Stevens again, before facing her day.</span></div></div>",

As Ms. Lee ate, Bianca watched on, sipping coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant.\" Bianca stated bluntly.  \"E-excuse me?\" Leslie asked, nearly choking on her orange juice.  \"You heard me.  You're pregnant.\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you joking?  That's ridiculous!  I haven't slept with any guys, and I haven't been artificially inseminated.  I can't be pregnant!\" Ms. Lee said, gasping as she felt an odd fluttering from her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm an OB/GYN.  I deal with pregnant women every single day.  But if you want me to spell it out for you, I will.  A few days ago when I woke up, you were throwing up.  You've been having weird cravings, your breasts are growing, and your ass is about to split that skirt.  And not to mention your stomach, which makes you look like a woman five months pregnant.  Or six.\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how do you imagine I got pregnant, huh?  I'm not the virgin Mary!\" Leslie exclaimed.  \"I can't answer that, I'm not the one who's pregnant.  But I can take you by my office to get a quick ultrasound, then drop you off at the school.  That sound alright?\" she asked.  Ms. Lee nodded, buttoning up her shirt, which was straining heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the examination room, Leslie lay down on the cold table and unbuttoned her shirt.  \"Let's see what's inside, shall we?\" Bianca asked, patting Leslie's rotund middle.  She applied the gel to Ms. Lee's stomach, and maneuvered the ultrasound wand around the tight expanse.  After a few moments, Bianca was able to come to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty.  Well, you're...you're pregnant, Leslie.  And there are...five babies!  We're going to be mothers, Leslie!\" Bianca exclaimed, giving Ms. Lee a kiss while rubbing her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie just stared at her growing belly, and was finally able to muster a word.  \"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger Goode stomped through the halls of Jackson High on the quest to find Mrs. Beverly.  She tried to fit into her normally tight clothing, but it was a struggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer curve-hugging pants were now curve-groping, and she was unable to button her shirt, due to her eight month looking belly.  The only thing keeping her stomach from being completely exposed was her undershirt, which she was mainly using as a makeshift bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Goode burst into Mrs. Beverly's office.  \"Oh my god.\" the two said simultaneously, shocked at each others size.  \"What happened to you?\" Mrs. Beverly said, rubbing her full-term sized belly over her maternity blouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  You look like you could go into labor at any moment!  How many babies are you having?\" Ms. Goode asked.  \"I don't know, I'm getting an ultrasound after school.  What about you?\" Mrs. Beverly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Megan, I don't even know if I really am pregnant.  My sudden increase in appetite must have caused this.  No baby in here.\" she said confidently, giving her belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Alright, then.  Why did you stop by?\" Mrs. Beverly asked.  Ms. Goode paused, giving a confused look.  \"I...forgot.\" she said, tracing a finger around her globular tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy brain...\" Megan said under her breath.  \"Well, if you ever think of it, I'll be here.\" she concluded.  \"Uh-huh.\" Ginger said, turning to exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, her belly bumped into a bookshelf, knocking down the books with it.  \"Oops, sorry!  I should get going.\" she said, as the bell for first period rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...denial is the first step on the path to acceptance.\" Mrs. Beverly said, rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The class nearly gasped when Ms. Ginger Goode strutted into the room, her outfit effectively skin-tight as her various features were on display even more than usual. And if that wasn't enough, Ginger's bust and butt were several inches larger than before. All of the students who imagined what their math teacher would look like topless were close to having their wish come true as the full size and shape of her breasts were visible, as well as the impression of her growing nipples against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger sat on the desk and leaned back. Normally, this would be a chance to show off her ridiculous hip-to-waist ratio, but her breasts weren't the only thing that had grown over the past few days. Ginger sported a huge round belly and anyone who hadn't seen her in the previous few days would say without a doubt that the woman they are looking at is pregnant. And far along, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down,\" Ginger sighed, lifting one hand in the air. \"I know what all your gasping and sweating is about: you're worried about the test next week.\" She decided to ignore the matter of her \"weight gain\" and divert the issue to the students' fears of her difficult teaching methods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her seat, Mary nodded quickly, her eyes wide open as she drank up Ms. Goode unbelievable attire. And like every other student, she was shocked by what looked like her teacher's overnight conception. Still, Mary couldn't help thinking about her own belly and how it was growing. She wasn't as big as Ginger, but if her math teacher could go from supermodel to baby-on-board in a matter of days, why couldn't she? Beyond the obvious reason that Mary had never had sex. Somehow, she didn't think Ms. Goode had the same problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's eyes moved over to Abigail, who was blushing bright red and averting her eyes. \"What's the matter?\" Mary whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Goode is dressed so...so lewdly,\" Abigail whispered back. \"It's not right. It's improper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still in dress code,\" Mary said, never fully understanding her friend's statements about religious dogma. Still, she found Abigail easier to follow than Ginger's dizzying Calculus knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Public schools are all so secularized now, it's no wonder morals are degrading,\" Abigail huffed, parroting her parents' nightly dinner discussions. \"That's what puts crazy ideas in your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary blushed and pulled away from Abigail. She'd tried to kill Abigail last night after dinner, believing Abigail was finally showing the same affection for Mary as Mary had for her. But Abigail pushed her away and hurried back to her severely Christian household. Despite Abigail's reaction, Mary still sensed something between them. Mary might not have been a great student when it came to facts and data you can learn in a classroom, but she had a special sense when it came to matters of the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So to lessen your fears about the test, I've got a little something for you,\" Ginger grunted as she tried to pivot on her heavy hips to her bag and pulled out a big stack of papers. \"A pop quiz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class groaned and the lusty eyes of several boys and girls finally fluttered awake when they heard their curvy teacher's words. A pop quiz? In calculus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger tried to walk normally down the aisles of desks to hand out the quiz, her steps wobbling as she was forced to waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Ms. Goode,\" one student gulped as his eyes peered in between the buttons of Ginger's blouse to peek at her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Albert. Just keep your eyes on your own work,\" Ginger smirked and slapped the quiz down on the student's desk. \"It's a toughie, but it'll prepare you for Monday's test. If you pay attention, that is.\" Albert groaned and turned his baseball cap around and started working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the quizzes were handed out, Ginger waddled back to her desk, showing the class that she did not, in fact, look pregnant from behind. As she sat in her chair, Ginger flipped through her phone and tried shopping for a good OB/GYN to get an ultrasound at. As improbable as it was that she gained a pregnant belly in less than a week, Megan Beverly was all the evidence she needed that these kinds of things can happen. And besides, it wasn't like Ginger was living life in a convent. There were plenty of gentlemen who provided her with company without using a condom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ginger found what looked like a good doctor, she angled her phone to get a good selfie of her rubbing her belly. She texted it to Roger \u2014 Veronica Lopez's husband and Ginger's fling \u2014 and added the caption \"Yours? ;)\"  She cackled to herself and wondered about how Roger would respond, which distracted her from the conversation going on between Mary and Abigail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way we're pregnant,\" Abigail hissed at Mary as she tried to fill out her quiz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you saw Ms. Goode. We're not far from that now,\" Mary whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've been saving myself for marriage,\" Abigail said. \"So it's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of one woman you know you got pregnant when she was a virgin,\" Mary said, smiling a little. \"I'll give you a hint: we have the same name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you,\" Abigail snapped back. \"First you try to commit an abomination with me, then you blaspheme?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An abomination?\" Mary said. \"Don't be mean, Abigail. I can't help liking you. And...don't you like me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet!\" Abigail said, her voice much louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cheerleaders looked up and saw only belly greeting them. Looking up a little more, they saw a massive pair of breasts. And after leaning back in their seats, they saw Ginger glaring at them, a smile across her full, red lips. \"M-Ms. Goode, we weren't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it,\" Ginger said. \"Mary, I've been following your performance in this class. You need help just to get a C. Though you should have picked someone besides Abigail here to give you the answers on a Calculus test. She probably still thinks Galileo should have been imprisoned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you,\" Abigail huffed. \"I'm not Catholic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ginger drew in another breath to snap back, her t-shirt ripped apart up the middle. All of her bare, round pregnant belly was on display, as was the underside of her breasts. Ginger's face turned red but she stood strong, putting her hands on her wide hips. \"To Mrs. Beverly's office. Both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got up, Mary could see the impression of little kicks against the otherwise smooth skin of Ginger's belly. \"Wow, so you really are pregnant,\" she murmured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Ginger barked as the classroom erupted with laughter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Veronica Lopez sat in Mrs. Beverly's office, stroking her large belly and looking at it sadly. \"Seven?\" Megan Beverly repeated, her jaw still hung in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si,\" Veronica said, patting her large mount of a pregnant bump. \"That would explain the size, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Megan murmured, her hands tracing her own pregnant belly. She couldn't help but notice how she was larger than her Latina colleague and friend. Veronica looked overdue, sure, but Megan looked like she could sneeze and she'd go into labor at any minute with triplets kicking and squirming inside her. Little did she know that there were a lot more than three babies waiting inside her womb. \"Did you tell your husband yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't had the chance,\" Veronica sighed, her hands curving under her big belly. \"He's seemed distant lately. Nervous, even. Maybe he's noticed I've been getting bigger and doesn't find me attractive anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush,\" Megan pouted, giving Veronica a little smile. \"Even with the belly, you still look amazing. You've got an amazing face, beautiful hair, great skin, and your...\" Megan cleared her throat. \"You've gotten bigger in more places than your stomach, let's put it that way.\" Veronica chuckled and smiled back. \"And it's not as if your belly is unattractive, Veronica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither is yours,\" Veronica smiled. \"It's a little cute actually.\" Megan blushed and curled up more tightly in her seat. \"What, you don't think you look good pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shrugged. \"It's not like Jim ever said I looked good when I was pregnant...or showed me he found me attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's his loss,\" Veronica sighed. \"You're radiant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled again and looked down at her belly. \"No offense, Veronica, but if you're carrying septuplets, then I'm a little scared for my own ultrasound. Who knows how many they'll find in me? It's hard enough when I thought I was expecting one more baby. If it's twins, I'll be totally worn out. If it's triplets, I'll have a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it's more?\" Veronica said, raising an eyebrow. There was a knock at the office door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke,\" Megan said, groaning as she heaved herself from her seat and waddled to the door. Opening it was a struggle, with her and Veronica's bellies in the way in the cramped office. \"Abigail? Mary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were sent by Ms. Goode,\" Abigail mumbled, her head hung in shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk with you later,\" Veronica said, grunting as she stood and placed a sympathetic hand on Megan's shoulder before waddling out. As Abigail and Mary took a seat, Megan made her way to her computer and saw an email from Ginger Goode about the quiz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheating on a test?\" Megan said, putting one hand on her forehead and the other on her belly. She was astounded. \"I would have never pegged either of you girls for cheaters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Beverly, honestly, we weren't cheating!\" Mary said. \"We were talking, sure, but not cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, I know your grades aren't...the best,\" Megan sighed, the hand on her belly staying put. \"But to go this far...\" She turned to Abigail. \"And Abigail, you're such a close friend of Mary's. You should have told her about the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean 'close friend?'\" Abigail stammered, her face turning red. \"Because we're not 'that' close, if that's what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan paused. \"I...I don't think I follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me say it!\" Abigail whined, holding her hands close to her belly. After gingerly feeling its tight roundness, she threw her hands away again and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Megan sighed, turning to Mary instead. \"In a situation like this, we obviously have to make a note in your transcripts. And we'll have to contact your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Beverly, please!\" Abigail whined again. \"I...I swear to God, we were not cheating. Please, I don't want my arguing with Mary to hurt her grades or her chances at getting into a college.\" Mary turned to her friend and gulped. She'd never \"swore to God\" before. She was far too religious for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan knew that too and let out a slow sigh. \"Let me check with Ms. Goode and see your quizzes. I think that's only fair. Excuse me.\" Megan heaved herself around her desk, her belly bumping into both Mary and Abigail. \"Sorry, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause in the room. \"I guess Ms. Goode isn't the only pregnant teacher here,\" Mary said with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what a pregnant belly feels like but...that felt like the real deal,\" Abigail said, rubbing her cheek, a little red from where Megan's womb smacked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do,\" Mary said, putting a hand on her own round stomach. \"Hers was bigger but...they feel about the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, please,\" Abigail said loudly, cutting her off. \"I...I can't be pregnant. I know it looks like it and that's what all the signs point to, but if my parents found out I was pregnant...they'd throw me out. They'd cut me out of the family. I'd be all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you wouldn't,\" Mary said quietly, reaching one hand over to Abigail. \"You'd have me.\" Abigail flinched when Mary touched her, but relaxed and gripped Mary's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this is wrong,\" Abigail said, her face feeling like a balloon on the verge of bursting. \"To be...homosexual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it feel wrong?\" Mary said, her eyes welling up with tears. \"I mean, you do like me don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Abigail said, now sobbing as well. \"But I'm not supposed to! And I'm not supposed to be pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Abigail,\" Mary said, moving to her friend and holding her tightly. \"As long as I know you like me too, that's all I need.\" Then Abigail did something Mary wasn't expecting: she kissed her fellow cheerleader. The two pressed their lips together, sharing their first truly intimate moment. As they heard footsteps, Mary lurched back into her own seat and tried to rub her cheeks dry as Megan waddled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls! Don't cry, it'll be okay!\" Megan said. \"I checked your tests and your answers didn't match at all.\" The two girls started crying again and Megan's lip began to quiver. \"Stop or you'll make me do it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you be crying?\" Abigail said through her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm always so gushy,\" Megan sobbed. \"And hormones too, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail and Mary stopped crying almost instantly. \"Hormones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stopped and looked at both of them. \"Just between us, okay?\" She sighed. \"Yes, I'm pregnant. I know it's the rumor, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our lips are sealed,\" both girls said in unison, standing up and secretly holding hands behind their backs. \"Can we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, go ahead,\" Megan said, unaware that Mary was notoriously bad at keeping secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the first person Mary tells?</span></div></div>",

Before they left, they hesitated and locked eyes, smiling weakly, before continuing on. But as Mary turned the corner, she ran belly-first into Becky, her fellow cheerleader and the only one on the team who hadn't drank any Xpect. \"Mary, watch where you're going with that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Mary giggled, patting her hands on her large stomach. Hearing someone refer to it as an independent object amused Mary, especially since she was already thinking of it as a pregnant belly. \"It's getting big, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, it is. You and the whole cheerleading team is getting all pudgy. I don't see why I work so hard if the rest of you are going to keep ruining my chances at the championships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'll keep working,\" Mary nodded quickly, feeling a strange twinge inside her round middle. It wasn't the same as butterflies in her stomach, but it definitely felt like some sort of movement. Her hand slowly moved to her belly and tried to trace the sensation, but it was too faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you coming from anyway?\" Becky said, looking around. \"Were you in Mrs. Beverly's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ms. Goode sent Abigail and me there,\" Mary sighed. \"She's been very agitated lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's probably pregnant,\" Becky cackled. \"You've seen her belly and tits, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her shirt burst apart in class today and we all saw her bare belly,\" Mary laughed. \"So now this school has at least two pregnant teachers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\" Becky said, raising an eyebrow. \"Why, who's the other one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not supposed to say,\" Mary said, lifting her chin and puffing out her chest in defiance. \"She told us to promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told who? You and Abigail?\" Becky smirked, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. And she won't tell you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this came up during your meeting in her office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of,\" Mary nodded before stopping. \"Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Becky laughed under her breath. \"Mrs. Beverly is finally pregnant while we're students here. We get to see one of her legendary periods of waddling around with a swollen belly. And she must be pretty far along since she's already looking big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't supposed to tell!\" Mary said again, her face turning red. \"I-I-I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Becky smiled, putting her arm around Mary's shoulder. \"You can trust me, can't you?\" Mary sighed and nodded. \"Now there aren't any other secrets you're keeping from me, are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's mental image of her kissing Abigail flashed into her head and her face started to burn up. \"No!\" Mary yelped, running away as quickly as she could with her large belly in front of her. Becky laughed again and turned around to keep walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like she <i>is</i> keeping something from me. Oh well,\" Becky sighed. \"One secret at a time.\" Becky got out her phone and started texting everyone about Mrs. Beverly's latest pregnancy as she walked to her next class. And across the building, Chelsea and Michelle were deep in hushed conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely?\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea nodded. \"Ms. Stevens said I was pregnant, no doubt. And feel,\" Chelsea took Michelle's hand and placed it against her large belly. Michelle looked at Chelsea's stomach confused for a few seconds until she felt fluttering under her fingers. \"Feel it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Michelle gulped, moving her hand to her own belly. \"I've been...feeling something similar all day. I guess that seals it: I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Chelsea said, crossing her arms. \"I may have never been pregnant before, but I know you don't get this big this fast. And besides, you're a...a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virgin. You can say it,\" Michelle smiled, her cheeks reddening. \"And yeah, it's a mystery all right, but the facts are facts: if you're pregnant, I'm pregnant too. Are you getting an ultrasound anytime soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" Chelsea said. \"Would you...like to come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should,\" Michelle sighed, rolling up her shirt and checking her tight, round belly. \"I need to make sure this is definitely real before I tell my parents...are you going to tell your dad? Or Zack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea hesitated. \"I'll wait until after the ultrasound too. Besides, it feels like there's more than one baby in there.\" At that, both girls gulped nervously and hurried to their class.</span></div></div>",

It was a nice bathroom, nicer than any of the student bathrooms, and was kept rigorously clean by both Ms. Brown, and Ms. Brown's ruthless enforcement of facility cleanliness. You could eat off the toilet seat of the teacher's bathroom and it would be one of the most hygienic meals would ever eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in this bathroom where a life was changed forever, and it was changed with a bright blue plus sign, two pink lines, and sure enough, big bold faced letters that read PREGNANT on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree tests, taken at three different times, all with the same matter-of-fact result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read the instructions a hundred times, making sure she understood everything. She did. She could results the instructions back and forth with 100% accuracy. <br>\r\nShe stared at the three tests, her tight fitting blouse discarded, hanging neatly on a clothes hook in the bathroom. She stood there with her brown skirt undone, the large firm bulge stretching out her plain beige panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to believe it, but she seemed to \"pop\" overnight. When she woke up, she was huge. She knew what it was, what it had to be, but refused to accept it. <br>\r\nFinding the loosest fighting clothes she had (which barely fit) she snuck into work early that day. She didn't want to be seen by anyone. Once they saw her, it was over. Everyone would know. What would they say? At HER age? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n55 and Pregnant? Scandal. Still best not to worry about how many chickens you had until they hatched. Or as the old saying goes. <br>\r\nStill, today was what the students called a \"lax\" day. Those once-in-blue moon where outside life or illness kept Ms. Brown from terrorizing the students of the school with 110% dedication and efficiency. She knew how rumors started and how fast they spread. If any student or teacher so her like this, especially with how prominent her new belly looked in these clothes, she would never hear the end of it IF she wasn't pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the chances of IF NOT PREGNANT were slowly dwindling down to nearly 0% at this point. She could swear she could FEEL herself growing by the hour. She tried to do her job the best she could, hiding her vast round expanse behind folders and whatnot, and most of the staff today seemed distracted (including a new of female staff who looked pregnant themselves and then some), so she was able to sneak out early for a heavy lunch (burger, fries, milkshake, and a salad) and head over to the drug store to pick up three different tests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be sure. The store was a madhouse as nearly every pregnancy test in store was nearly sold out, Ms. Brown having to resort to some off-brand pregnancy tests she never heard off (but still claimed to be 100% as accurate as the big name brands). Women, and oddly even several very fat men where buying up pregnancy tests by the handful, as if pregnancy tests might become a valuable currency after the great collapse or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bought the tests and headed back to school, buying an extra large vanilla and chocolate ice-cream cone on the way back, trying to satisfy this incredible craving for ice cream she's had over the past few days. Hell, the ice cream was one of the first signs that she was unexpectedly expecting, as she HATED Ice Cream. Yet, every since that Xpect Drink, she couldn't get enough of it. She had it after after lunch and dinner, and as a light snack in between. It wasn't just the ice cream, it was the toppings, nuts, pickles, hot sauce. It was such a pregnancy cliche. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ms. Brown stood half-naked in the bathroom, one hand on her (unbeknownst to her triple filled) belly, the other looking over the pregnancy test instructions one more. She couldn't deny it anymore. She had a bun in her oven. In her 55 year old single oven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck\" was all Ms. Brown said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hated kids. Now she going to have one, probably more than one judging by her size explosion, by herself at 55. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" She said again loudly. She hardly ever sword, let alone in school. It was against regulations, but this, this was one time where it seemed okay to break the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror, the large gentle slope of her pregnant belly that stretched out her panties, causing them to hang low and hug the underside of the curve of her lived filled dome. Her breasts, once dropping, perked up a little bit, and seemed to be spilling out of her beige bra. She put one hand into the small of her bare back, trying to push her pregnant belly out further. Yup, she looked pregnant all right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one hand on her belly and exploring the space, and picking up a pregnancy test with another, she looked down. She saw her feet, but for how long? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck\" she said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what to do, she should give them up. Motherhood was not her forte, but yet, something deep deep down inside of her, the tiny spark barely visible in such a foul blackness of Ms. Brown, told her.. \"No. These are yours. Enjoy them. Love them. Get pregnant fat. Eat Ice Cream. Waddle\". The faintest of smiles crossed across her face, shaken off milliseconds later by the stern exterior that Ms. Brown usually wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing more to think about then\" Ms. Brown said, picking up the pregnancy tests, drying them off, wrapping them in toilet paper, and dropping them into her purse. She would save them, for a scrap book. She was old fashioned, and there was only one thing to do in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diapers, toys, cribs, clothes, food\" She said to herself, as in a mantra. She repeated it to herself over and over again, as she explored every angle of her new pregnant self. She took photos with her smart phone, replicating many of the \"sexy selfie\" poses she had disappointingly seen on the phones she confiscated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diapers, toys, cribs, clothes, food\" She said again. CLICK. She repeated it again. CLICK. It was a list, of everything she would need. <br>\r\n\"Diapers, toys, cribs, clothes, food\" She could make it work. CLICK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the bathroom, she heard some of her coworkers enter into the teacher's lounge, where the teacher's bathrooms were. She would need to \"drop the news\" as she heard them say or something, lest rumors started. She needed to control the information, SHE needed to be in charge, as she always was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter to let them know now. She looked at her pregnance in the mirror, and grabbed her blouse, not putting it back on. \"Seeing is believing\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Diapers, toys, cribs, clothes, food\" She repeated as she walked out into the crowded teacher's lounge, only in a unbuttoned skirt and bra on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Diapers, toys, cribs, clothes food</i> She thought to herself as they all looked at her. She putted a hand in the small of her back, and pushed out trying to make her belly look bigger. <br>\r\n<i>Diapers, toys, cribs, clothes, food</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she wanted some ice cream right now. </span></div></div>",

Or ones...\" she groaned, heading inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, a nurse approached her, helping her to a chair.  \"M'am, are you in labor?  We need to get you to a hospital!\" she exclaimed.  \"No, I'm not going into labor!  I'm just getting an ultrasound!\" Megan said.  The nurse paused.  \"Oh, are you Megan Beverly?  Follow me, you're a bit late.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse led Mrs. Beverly into an examination room, and saw that Bianca, Ms. Lee's partner, was waiting inside.  \"Megan, you've grown a bit since we've seen each other, haven't you?\" Bianca smiled.  \"Yes, yes I have.\" Megan replied, rubbing her belly.  \"Well, I guess you've seen Leslie, today, right?\" Bianca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she told me that she was pregnant!  Congratulations!  I think it's the perfect time for the two of you to have a kid!\" Megan said, lying down on the cold table.  \"Well, she's actually having five babies...\" Bianca said, rolling up Megan's shirt to apply the gel to her pregnant stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five?  Wow, she didn't tell me that...\" Megan said, shivering as Bianca ran the ultrasound wand across her swollen expanse.  She had gone through many, many ultrasounds, but it felt...different this time.  \"Yeah, she was a bit shocked when we found out this morning.  To be honest, we really have no idea how she got pregnant--wait, there's no way!  This is the second time today!\" she said, looking at the monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, is there something wrong?\" Megan asked, worried.  \"No, the babies are healthy.  But...you're having octuplets!\" Bianca exclaimed.  Megan gasped.  \"Octuplets?  Eight babies?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear so.  You're about four months along.  And you don't have to, but I would advise you to go on maternity leave as soon as possible.  With octuplets, it's better to be safe and not risk anything, but they all seem extremely healthy.\" Bianca said.  \"No, I think I'll stay working as long as I can.  Maybe it'll take my mind off of it all.\" she said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure Lisa feels the same way, so you won't be alone.\" Bianca smiled.  \"So you said that this was the second time today?  What were you talking about?\"  Megan asked.  \"Oh!  There was another woman I examined who is having octuplets.  Her name was Julie.  She's actually as far along as you are.\"  Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, was she kind of short, wears a tracksuit?\" Megan asked, having a feeling she knew who it was.  \"Yep.  Well, she TRIED to wear a tracksuit.  Her belly was a BIT too big for it.  Do you know her?\" Bianca asked.  \"She's the cheerleading coach at the high school.  So me, Leslie, Julie, Veronica, Ginger, and Susan are all pregnant.  And even some of the students had bigger bellies...\" Megan noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  That many people pregnant?  That seems...odd.  When did you first think you were pregnant?\" Bianca asked.  \"A few days ago.  I can't speak for the students, but at a faculty meeting we had this drink called Xpect.\"  Megan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xpect, you say?  Hmm.  I'll get my hands on a can tonight and try to run some tests on it.\" Bianca said.  \"Wait, aren't you just an OB/GYN?\" Mrs. Beverly asked.  \"I was actually a biology major in college, that's how I met Leslie.  I just liked this career field more.\" Bianca explained.  The two then parted ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after Megan ate a large meal at a nearby restaurant, she returned to her home.  When she entered, she noticed that it was relatively quiet inside, except from noise from the TV.  She waddled through the living room, and saw Jim on the couch.  When he saw her, his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan?  What the--\" Jim said.  \"Hey, sweetie.  How was your day?\" she asked, trying to avoid the imminent conversation.  \"Fine.  What the fuck is that?\" he asked, pointing to her pregnant belly.  \"I...am pregnant!\" she said, attempting to make it a joyous occasion.  \"Yeah, I could tell.  Why didn't you tell me?  I thought we were done!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I only found out today!  I had an ultrasound to confirm it.\" Megan said.  \"And?\" Jim asked, feeling that she had more to say.  \"I'm pregnant with eight babies.\"  she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was shocked.  \"Eight?  Megan, we can't raise eight more kids!  Especially all at once!\" he said.  \"I know, Jim.  We'll figure something out.  I promise.  They're kicking, do you want to feel?\" she asked, rolling up her blouse to reveal her shifting belly.  Jim reluctantly raised his hand, and felt his many, many unborn children kick and squirm inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late at night, and Bianca was in her and Leslie's basement, researching Xpect.  There were two cans on the desk she was sitting at:  one Xpect can, and one soda can which she was drinking to stay awake.  She poured a small amount of Xpect into a petri dish and held it under a microscope.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw pitch black, like a vast expanse of nothingness.  \"Odd.  Very odd.  It's almost as if this Xpect drink makes the consumer...pregnant.  But how?\" she asked.  Bianca reached for her soda and took a swig.  She placed it down, and gasped in horror.  It was the can of Xpect.  \"Oh, dear.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ginger Goode grunted and shifted her seat back again while she waited at a stoplight to try and get comfortable. The trick was getting to a place where her swollen middle wasn't pressing against the steering wheel but she could still safely drive. And if Ginger knew about what exactly was causing her stomach to grow into a fleshy ball, she'd be more focused on the \"safe\" part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" Ginger complained to no one as she now struggled with her seatbelt, made tight and uncomfortable thanks to her belly. \"How many problems is getting fat going to cause?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like everyone else at the school who drank Xpect and worried when they woke up with more than just a potbelly, Ginger was worried she wasn't just dealing with fat. And unlike students like Abigail and Michelle, she couldn't simply dispel her fears by reminding herself of her chastity. There was a healthy-sized list of gentlemen Ginger was thinking about as potential baby daddies at the moment. But Ginger also knew she took birth control on a strictly-adhered schedule. Plus, bellies like this don't exactly show up overnight. Or over a few nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except...\" Ginger sighed, bringing her fingers to her pillowy lips in contemplation. On second thought, she'd recently had her prescription changed and was on a different, cheaper brand of the pill. And if it was defective, that would make the most likely candidate for her baby \u2014 or babies \u2014 Roger, Veronica's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger began to cackle as the realization dawned on her, driving along with the stream of cars in front of her. She'd sent him the picture of her belly as a way to rattle his cage, but he could really be the one who got her pregnant. If she's pregnant, that is. Ginger sighed as she pulled into the parking lot for her home at an apartment complex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first: I need to change,\" Ginger said, looking down at her tattered shirt. After her gut split her shirt open, she tried to teach the rest of the day with it put together the best she could. Ginger never had a problem with showing some skin to her students and liked the idea that it unnerved them. Like Mrs. Brown, Ginger enjoyed injecting a good dose of fear in the classroom. But she couldn't walk around the city looking like that. Unlike in the classroom, people catcall and worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger strutted to her door, her shirt wide open, letting her belly stick out bare and her breasts wobble around in their increasingly tight bra confines. As she approached her door, an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Carolines, shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten even more innapropriate,\" Mrs. Carolines grumbled. \"Always bringing men around, wearing those tiny clothes, and now you're showing off your bastard child before it's even born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon to you too,\" Ginger laughed, running her hand across her belly. \"I take it you don't want to rub and feel the kicks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Carolines let out an annoyed huff and gave Ginger the stink-eye before grabbing the rest of her mail and shakily walking back inside. Ginger laughed again and looked down at her stomach and saw that her hand hadn't left it. Rubbing her belly felt surprisingly good, which she only saw as further evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs did Grant Buckman, who was camped out behind a bush across the street. He was watching Ginger with binoculars and scribbling on a notepad, trying to find out just how many people at Mrs. Brown's school were, in fact, pregnant. He'd already confirmed Megan, Leslie, and Veronica's coming motherhood and had one last suspicious candidate to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" a man from the apartment Grant was camped out by said with a full garbage bag in his head. \"Are you spying on that woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what it looks like,\" Grant gulped. \"I'm a private investigator.\" Not technically true, but it sounded better than \"I'm following this woman for free for a friend.\" Plus, it looked bad for him to be watching a woman by hiding behind a bush anyway. He was wearing his \"detective\" attire, which with its long trenchcoat and binoculars, was very similar to a \"creepy stalker\" attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" the man said, narrowing his eyes. \"And you're watching that woman because?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant turned pale. He was in an incriminating position already, but if this man pushed any further, he might see that Grant was currently sporting a powerful erection. Ginger was attractive enough as it was, but coupled with Grant's pregnancy fetish, she was driving him a little wild. \"S-she's sleeping with the husband of her co-worker, or at least it's suspected that she is.\" Grant didn't know his lie was true, ironically enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \"Wouldn't surprise me. She struts around here all the time, showing off her body. Make sure you catch her.\" And with that, he was gone \u2014 off to the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice neighbors she has,\" Grant scoffed as he turned his eyes back. Ginger was already leaving her apartment, now wearing a large sweater that may have been baggy at one point but was now stretched out to accommodate her pregnant belly. He hurried to stay close to her as Ginger left the complex and waddled down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the local pharmacy and, with a sigh, picked out a pregnancy test. Ginger hadn't had to get one of these since college and this time, she didn't think she'd dodge a bullet. \"This and...a candy bar,\" Ginger said at the counter, feeling a sudden urge to eat a cookies and cream bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you really need this?\" the cashier said with a skeptical look. \"You're not already sure you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ring it up,\" Ginger snapped back, rolling her eyes. She stuffed the small box under her arm and shoved the candy into her mouth, chewing it as she waddled back. But halfway to her apartment, she stopped and turned around. \"Is someone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant held his breath, hiding just around the corner as she tried to avoid detection. But his ridiculous trenchcoat was too large for his own good and the tail end stuck out all too obviously. Ginger waddled over and pulled Grant out from behind the building and glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" she said. \"Or should I get the cops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um,\" Grant stammered, a little frozen by Ginger's beauty up close, even though his mind was racing for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger's eyes caught his notebook and some of his scribbles and things started to click for her. \"Wait a minute...you're not some stalker. Someone told you to trail me.\" She let go of him and crossed her arms against her ample chest, grinning a little. \"Interesting. Who would want you to follow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say,\" Grant said, turning to leave before Ginger stood in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of one nosy woman at work who wants to maintain her version of order,\" Ginger nodded. \"Or a married Latina who might have gotten wise. Or any other reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-like I said, I can't say,\" Grant said, this time stopped by Ginger's belly as she pressed it into his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, don't be like this,\" she cooed, puffing her lips out and leaning in with her breast, letting Grant peek down her vast cleavage. \"Why don't we talk about it...at my apartment.\" What Ginger didn't realize was her belly was doing more of the persuading than any other part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think that would be okay,\" Grant nodded and Ginger giggled playfully and wrapped one arm around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Nice and easy,\" Ginger purred.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Are we all ready to go?\" Julie asked her small crew of cheerleaders. She had on her usual dark jacket, but with her belly as big as it is now, its usual bagginess was changed into a zip-up leotard. And even the zipper was only up about three-fourths of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea and the rest of the cheerleaders just mumbled quietly in reply. They weren't as big as their coach, but each girl struggled to fit into her uniform thanks to her large pregnant stomachs. Mary and Abigail had both already resigned to the fact that they must be pregnant, despite their abstinence, and were currently shooting each other friendly looks, stroking one another's bellies gently. After tonight's game, they were looking forward to spending some time together and discovering just how much they cared for one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea was still trying to deny the obvious reality jutting out from her middle, but she and Michelle were fairly convinced they must be pregnant. All that was left was to bite the bullet and go to the doctor's office for a test and ultrasound to confirm it all. At least for Chelsea, she thought this was in the realm of possibility. She and Zack had unprotected sex every now and then and birth control pills don't always work. But Michelle had yet to get her first kiss, yet the movement inside her beach ball-like belly was impossible to ignore. The only cheerleader still firmly in denial about her coming maternity was Zoe, but she was hard to read. The gorgeous senior was one of the school's great mysteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>I'm</u> ready,\" Becky said with a smile, looking at Chelsea directly before turning back to Julie. \"I'm not the one who put on a ton of weight...or got sloppy with my pill schedule.\" Chelsea's cheeks burned as Becky ran her hand down her flat stomach. \"Come one team, let's run out there and do a few cartwheels while we're at it. Everyone up to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one dared snap back at her. They were all too aware that there was no way they could run out in their condition. \"I have to rule against that,\" Julie finally said, breaking the silence. \"We have the championships in a few days and we wouldn't want to do anything risky and get an injury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Running out is risky?\" Becky said, putting her hands on her hips. \"And it's the last home game of the season. We're seriously not going to do an even semi-flashy entrance to catch everyone's attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think anyway we go out with get attention,\" Michelle whispered to Chelsea, which made the team captain giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brisk jog out, how about that?\" Julie said. \"It's not as though you girls sprint at every game. Now come on, hands in the middle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ended up getting their bellies together in the circle as the pep band began to play. All six girls ran out, with Becky far ahead thanks to her lack of a belly. Becky waved the most gleefully, laughing to herself as she heard the rest of the audience gawk at the rest of the cheerleaders. Their uniforms weren't letting their bellies come out uncovered yet, but they were a few stitches away by the look of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea and the rest tried to stay composed as they got to their spot and waved back to the crowd, smiling the biggest fake smile they could muster. Only Abigail was having a hard time keeping the facade up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, the football team ran out and Zack turned to wave to his girlfriend. Chelsea waved back and Zack took off his helmet to get a better look, clearly confused by her size. They hadn't seen a lot of one another in a while and in her cheerleading uniform, it was much harder to hide her pregnant gut under a coat or puffy shirt. As Zack slowly moved away, Chelsea's smile vanished and her arms fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about all of them,\" Julie said, walking past the girls. \"Take a seat and get ready to do the Spring Classic at the next time out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game went on without too much of a hitch. The Jackson High defense was keeping the game competitive but Zack was clearly distracted and wasn't making too many strong passes. Michelle was using a pair of binoculars to inspect the other side's crowd and cheerleaders, nudging Chelsea after a while. \"Who are we playing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bermont High,\" Chelsea said. \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle handed Chelsea the binoculars and she gasped. Several of the other team's cheerleaders were pregnant as well. So were lots of women and, by the look of it, men in the opposing audience. \"Weird, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Chelsea said, trembling a little. Just what was going on in this city? She was cut off as the clock went all the way down and halftime came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone up,\" Julie said, clapping her hands. The girls hurried as quickly as they could, trying to do the best poses they could while wobbling around, their bellies weighing them down. The crowd just kept laughing and laughing and Chelsea felt her cheeks burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do the standing pyramid,\" Chelsea said. \"We can do it, come on. We've got to win them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else, save for Becky, was clearly nervous about it, but they trusted Chelsea's enthusiasm. Mary, Abigail, and Michelle stood on the bottom and Zoe and Chelsea did their best to climb onto their shoulders, grunting and shaking the whole time. \"Stand still,\" Becky laughed as she did a running jump to get on top, waving gleefully at the crowd. As people began to clap, the pregnant girls were all losing balance quickly. \"Don't drop me, preggos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not pregnant!\" Michelle yelled, and with that, the whole pyramid began to fall apart. Each girl quickly jumped ship and tried to do tumbles and flips to save face. When they had all taken a happy sigh and were glad it was over, they heard the laughter only growing. Looking down, each pregnant cheerleader now had their bellies totally exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abigail!\" a loud voice roared from the stands. Abigail looked up and saw her extremely religious parents staring at her. Abigail's father was fuming and her mother was shaking her head in despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled her eyes and Abigail ran back to the locker room as quickly as her pregnant body could take her. \"Wait! Abigail!\" Mary said, stopped from following her by Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give her a little space for now,\" Julie said, whispering in her ear. \"I know how you feel about each other but...trust me. Wait until after the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn't get much better from there out. After halftime, Jackson High's performance plummeted and they ended up losing by two touchdowns. The cheerleaders didn't try anything else daring, except for Becky, and went back to the locker room dejected. \"That was awful,\" Chelsea grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just got distracted. There's a lot of...illness going around,\" Julie said. \"With some more focus, championships can be ours. I know it can, if we perform the way we did a few days ago. Now go get changed and head home.\" Julie paused and took a deep breath. \"But before we go, I should let you all know something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Zoe asked, her lips spreading into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to keep being your coach, so don't worry, but I recently confirmed that I...am...pregnant,\" Julie said, unzipping the rest of her jacket and placing her hands on her belly. The other cheerleaders pretended to be surprised and \"aww\"ed, clapping a bit. \"Thank you. It's been a bit of a whirlwind but I've always wanted a little boy or girl of my own...though one at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll be a great mom,\" Chelsea smiled, unsure about whether she can say the same about herself.</span></div></div>",

Chelsea offered to take Michelle home, and the two got in Chelsea's car, having to move the seats back slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is real?  We're actually pregnant, huh?\" Michelle asked, rubbing her round bump.  \"I think so.  I mean, I can't even imagine what else it could be.  The symptoms seem to fit.\" Chelsea replied, placing one hand on her own belly as she felt movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, what am I gonna tell my parents?  I'm a virgin, you know that, so me being pregnant should be impossible!\" Michelle said, still trying to cling on to the ever evaporating hope that she wasn't in fact pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.  But somehow, someway, we're PROBABLY pregnant.\" Chelsea said.  \"I'll probably tell my parents tomorrow after the ultrasound.  You?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell Zack and Dad tomorrow.  Zack's probably still upset after the game, so I'll let him simmer for a bit.  And if I tell Dad tonight he'd take me to the ER, and I really don't have time for that tonight.\" Chelsea said, pulling up to Michelle's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle exited the car and waddled towards her home, rubbing her pregnant belly.  \"I'll pick you up at about 10 tomorrow, alright?\" Chelsea asked.  \"Yeah, sounds good.  Maybe after we can get lunch and talk about Homecoming.  I hope we can still fit into our dresses tomorrow.\" Michelle added, entering her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea then comprehended what Michelle said.  \"Oh, shit.\" she said, realizing that it'd be a tight squeeze.  She drove home, and saw that the lights were still on.  Chelsea put her hands over her sweater-covered belly and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad was sitting on the couch watching TV, looking over to see her walk in.  \"Hey, how'd the game go?\" he asked.  \"Not great.  Lost by fourteen.\" she replied, heading to her bedroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Bermont?  We've beat them for the past ten years...\" her dad said.  \"Yeah.  The guys were a bit...distracted.\" she said.  \"Ah, that's a shame.  Last home game, too?\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  Anyways, I'm gonna go to bed.  Me and Michelle are gonna get ready for Homecoming tomorrow at her place.  I'm going at about 10 or so.\" she said, hiding the fact that she was going to get an ultrasound.  \"Fine by me.  Night, sweetie.\" he said, as Chelsea walked into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea opened her closet and saw her homecoming dress, pulling it out.  It was formfitting and bright green.  She shook her head, realizing that she couldn't be bothered to struggle with it tonight.  She put on a pair of pajamas and walked to her bed, rubbing the bit of bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea lay down on the bed, hearing it slightly creak.  Slowly, she drifted off to sleep, the faint movement inside her stomach easing her into slumber.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the school, Ms. Brown, Ms. Lee, Mrs. Lopez, and Ms. Goode arrived at the teacher workroom.  Mrs. Beverly had called them for a meeting to discuss something that she said was important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for arriving on such short notice.  As you all are probably aware, we are all mysteriously pregnant.\" Mrs. Beverly said.  Ms. Goode laughed.  \"Something wrong, Ginger?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you all might have buns in the oven, but I...I'm not pregnant.\" she said, obviously in denial.  \"Seriously?  We both look like we could give birth if we sneezed.\" Mrs. Lopez said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine.  I'm having an ultrasound tomorrow.\" Ginger huffed.  \"There we go.  So who's the daddy?\" Ms. Lee asked.  Ginger glanced at Mrs. Lopez and stared at the floor.  \"Uh, I'm not really sure.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to what I was saying, you all are going to be mothers for the first time, but if you've noticed, a handful of students look like they may be pregnant as well.\" Mrs. Beverly said.  \"Yeah, and they're all cheerleaders, too.  All but one of them, anyway.\" Ms. Brown said, oddly quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need guidance.  So starting Monday, I wanted us to have a meeting with them each day for the rest of their pregnancies.  We can talk about being pregnant, and prepare them for motherhood along the way.\" Mrs. Beverly said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when during the day?  It's not like there's a lot of free time in the schedule.\" Mrs. Lopez said.  \"During lunch.  That way they won't be embarrassed by their growing appetites.\"  Megan said.  The teachers all agreed that it would be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These next few months are going to be so fun!\" Mrs. Beverly said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Chelsea woke up, she already felt exhausted. Sure, she'd been asleep and resting, but her dreams were so vivid and quick, it felt like she'd been awake the whole night. A person has several different dreams during one sleep cycle and Chelsea felt like she remembered all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pregnant at school, she was pregnant in the hospital, she was pregnant on the moon, she was pregnant and taking care of her teenager daughters, all pregnant as well. Various versions of possible lives, all involving Chelsea swollen and ready to bring new life into the world. It was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's the day,\" Chelsea sighed, running her hand over her bare belly, getting a few squirms and kicks in response. If that'd happened two days ago, she would have screamed in shock. But now, it just made sense. Chelsea already knew, deep down, that she was pregnant. And with a lot of babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that really confused her was why she was already so big. When Chelsea went to sleep, the baggy t-shirt she wore covered most of her belly. It was too big to really conceal and there was plenty of underbelly to be seen, but that didn't bother her as much. Now, only the topmost curve was covered and Chelsea could look down and see plenty of acreage of smooth, bare, tight stomach. Well, when she looked down, the first thing that caught her attention were her increasingly buxom breasts, but that was far from her main concerns now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea let out a sad groan as she shifted off the bed onto her feet. \"Today's the day\" was supposed to mean the Homecoming Dance, but now it meant \"ultrasound day.\" What a mess the past week had made of her life. On top of the world one second, an unmarried pregnant teenager carrying a mysterious litter the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm not single,\" Chelsea smiled, trying to cheer herself up. But that just made her think about how she hadn't told her boyfriend about any of this yet. And besides, what does being single or not matter when you're pregnant. It wasn't like Zack would be having sex with her. She turned and looked at herself in the mirror, frowning a bit. Chelsea still didn't think any guys would want to join her in the sack anytime soon but...she didn't actually think she looked bad. In fact, her skin and hair had never looked better and the \"bum\" had a sexy quality to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be going crazy,\" Chelsea said, shaking her head and waddling to the shower. As she expected Day 5 was even harder than Day 4, which was harder than Day 3 and so on. She couldn't see her legs, which made stepping around a wet, slippery shower a dangerous situation, but she took it slow enough to be safe. And slowing down gave Chelsea that chance to really explore her new body, her new <b>pregnant</b> body, with her hands. It still amazed her how her huge beach-ball belly could be so tight. She always imagined pregnant bellies were a little squishier. Less surprising was the tightness of her new ass, which went right along with past experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showering already?\" her father said, knocking on the bathroom door. Chelsea froze, thinking he'd still be in bed. She had to get up a lot earlier to sneak up and go to the OB/GYN with Michelle. \"It's kinda...early for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, homecoming, you know?\" Chelsea said, laughing nervously. \"Got to put a lot of effort into looking good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always look good, dear,\" her father chuckled. \"You know...if Mom was here to see you, she'd be so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy,\" Chelsea said, turning off the water and biting her lip, a small smile curling. \"Not...not right now. I can't get this worked up this early in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" her father smiled, tapping his hand against the door a few times before heading downstairs. Chelsea let out a long breath and checked to see that he was gone before doing a clumsy quick waddle back to her room, water dripping from her popped-out navel onto the carpet. Once back in, she tried to dress to conceal her belly as best she could, but with her current advanced state of maternity, none of her regular clothes fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then I'll just try to look the best I can,\" Chelsea pouted, putting on a small sweater that made her breasts a little less lewd and a little more flirty and put on a pair of jeans to accentuate her butt. She left her belly exposed, trying to capitalize on the strong self-confidence she felt surrounding it at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle texted her and Chelsea picked up her phone quickly. &lt;here now. hurry!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea took a deep breath and looked around the staircase to make sure her father wasn't around. When she was convinced the coast was clear, she waddled down as quickly as she could, but unfortunately she didn't manage to be that quiet, thanks to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, is that you?\" her father said, walking into the foyer with oven mitts on. \"You sound like a bull in a china shop. I made you break...\" He stopped when he saw his teenage daughter, pregnant and with her enormous bare belly hanging out. \"Chelsea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, please,\" Chelsea said quietly. \"I...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" her father said, all the energy from his voice gone. Chelsea bit her lip again and ran out of the house toward Michelle's car, heaving herself into the backseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you got ready,\" Michelle smiled, turning around in the passenger seat. \"So I'm definitely too big to drive now, so I got my friend Tim to drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyello,\" Tim said, his voice rolling around as he turned back to look at Chelsea with a dramatic gaze. \"I'll be your chauffeur for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in the drama department at another high school,\" Michelle nodded. \"So he's used to keeping secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, lots,\" Tim smiled. \"I'd tell you both some, but that would break your trust in me as a confidant, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drive, dude,\" Michelle chuckled, elbowing Tim before looking back and Chelsea and frowning. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Chelsea mumbled, running her hand across her belly. \"Let's just get this over with.\"</span></div></div>",

The kind of sad feeling that comes from having the greatest dream you could imagine, only to realize that that was all it was: a dream. And now he was back to his regular life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, great,\" he heard in a breathy grumble next to him. Grant's eyes flew open as he turned to see Ginger Goode beside him in her bed and remember that it wasn't a dream after all. He'd spent the night in the company of the beautiful woman with the biggest pregnant belly he'd ever seen. \"It's bigger again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is!\" Grant cried out in joy, diving toward Ginger's belly, trying to wrap his arms around her pregnant roundness, lips puckered in glee. But Ginger pulled up her blankets and pushed him away with her hand. \"W-what's wrong?\" Grant said, looking up at the gorgeous teacher with puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's wrong,\" Ginger purred, running her fingertips down her swelling chest and down to her belly. To be honest, she'd been a little sex-starved since her belly started extending past her breasts and it was nice to have someone break her celibacy, especially someone who was so into her maternal body. \"I just don't like guys who are so clingy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled and moved out of the bed, keeping the blanket wrapped around her, not wanting to give Grant any more looks at her wonderful nudity. Ginger's reason for not wanting Ms. Susan Brown's spy wrapped around her again was a little more than what she said. During their tryst, Ginger had learned quite a few things thanks to his easy-loosened lips and suspected she'd be needing more information. Keeping her distance and letting the lust build up in Grant would be the best way to convince him to gather more for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was nervous about them getting too close for too long. That might resemble, ugh, a \"relationship.\" Ginger had no issues with long-term sexual partners, but didn't want much in the way of closeness. Whether it was because she didn't want to be restrained or because the idea frightened her, even Ginger didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably...shouldn't have let all that slip last night,\" Grant blushed. \"Susan's going to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell her?\" Ginger laughed from her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have to,\" Grant sighed, looking down with embarrassment. As he feared when Susan gave him this \"case,\" he let his love for pregnant women get the best of him. \"Humphrey Bogart would have kept his head,\" he grumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you tell her, that's not so bad,\" Ginger purred, moving her index finger across his chin. Grant was forced to look up and see Ginger now in lingerie that was somehow even sexier than her naked body. \"If, however, it means you don't stop filling me in on what's happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I wouldn't dream of it,\" Grant stammered. \"After all, this all concerns your...your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy?\" Ginger smiled, pressing her belly against Grant's chest and running her hands up and down it. \"Yes, I wished you'd told me before I gave the suspected father a scare.\" She laughed and started petting Grant's hair. \"Although I probably would have anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so...when I learn more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come right back here,\" Ginger smiled. \"Or rather, come right <i>here</i>.\" She patted the spot in her bed where they laid and giggled. \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Grant quickly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I need you to run off,\" Ginger said, patting him on the back. \"I have things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant did as he was told and got changed, running out the door and quickly getting out his phone to inform Susan of what happened. She did not take it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the students at my school were irresponsible,\" Susan groaned. \"I should never have had you do this. You're such a...a goof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant had to stop himself from laughing. He'd never heard the stoic, serious Susan use a word like \"goof\" before. \"But at least I got this information in the first place. Aren't you glad to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Susan sighed, rubbing her swollen stomach. \"Now I know that this 'Xpect Energy Drink' causes pregnancies. It's more important than ever that I get it out of my school now. It's already caused enough damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll bet,\" Grant gulped, picturing a school full of pregnant students and teachers. Then he started to think about what would happen if a man drank Xpect and shuddered. \"So what do you want be to look at next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where it's coming from, for starters,\" Susan said with a groan. She was currently in front of her mirror, doing her exercises in a leotard that made her belly look even larger. \"I won't have time to do any work myself. There's a homecoming dance tonight which is always one of my biggest challenges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you want me to go and look around at the dance?\" Grant stammered, wanting a look at who else at the school had a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you stay away,\" Susan grunted. \"You've caused enough trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Grant nodded, blushing as one more thought popped into his head. \"S-Susan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Susan said, lifting a barbell with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...<u>you</u> drink Xpect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Grant,\" she said, hanging up and tossing the phone as she slammed her weight down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant's face turned bright red as he put his phone away, wondering how seeing Susan with a big pregnant belly would affect him.</span></div></div>",

She rubbed it, and noticed that it was much bigger than it was the day before.  When Veronica had her ultrasound two days ago, she was told that she was three months along.  But for some reason, she had a feeling that she was a bit further along than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger Lopez walked in, glancing at his wife.  He told Veronica that he was staying late for work, but in reality he was actually sleeping with one of his co-workers.  Usually, it would have been with Ginger Goode, but a weird text admittedly irked him.  \"Hey, honey.\" she said, rubbing her eyes.  \"Hey.  Sleep well?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, yeah.  Roger, I have something to tell you.  I'm...pregnant.\" she said, removing the covers to reveal her huge stomach.  \"I...I heard.  But you're so big already!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you heard?  Who told you?\" she asked, squinting her eyes.  \"Uh--one of the teachers at your school.  Ran into them this morning.\" he gulped, recognizing his slip-up.  \"Ah, okay.  And to answer your question, the reason I'm so big is because I'm having septuplets.\" she said, one hand stroking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Septuplets?!?  What is that, like, seven babies?\" he asked, his eyes as wide as his wife's stomach, who nodded in confirmation.  \"So have you been taking fertility pills or something?  I don't think that's...natural.\" Roger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't been taking any fertility pills.  But this is real.  They're real, Roger.\" Veronica said, dragging his hand on top of her belly.  \"Uh-huh...\" he said, still trying to comprehend the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready to be a dad?\" she asked.  \"Uh-huh.\" he repeated.  \"Well, I should probably get dressed.  Lorenza's taking me to the mall to get things for the babies.  Oh, yeah!  She's pregnant, too!\" she said, heaving herself from her bed, waddling into the closet.  \"Jesus, is every female I know pregnant?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica left with Lorenza, and half an hour later he received a phone call.  \"Hello?\" he asked.  \"Hey, Roger.\" said the voice on the other end.  \"Ginger?  What do you want?\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your wife home?\" she asked.  \"What?  No, she's out with her sister.  Why?\" he asked.  \"I've got some big news for you.\" she said, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, there was a knock at the front door, and Roger opened it.  Ginger walked inside, donning a heavy coat.  \"What the hell do you want?\" Roger asked.  \"It depends on how you react to this.  I'm pregnant!\" she said, removing her coat to display her belly, which was the same size as Veronica's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You too?\"  he asked, annoyed at this discovery.  \"And I'm having seven babies...\" she said, seductively running a finger down her belly.  \"So now what?\" Roger asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have two choices.  One, you leave your wife for me.\" Ginger said.  \"You want me to leave Veronica for you?  No way.  She's pregnant, too.  It's not happening, I love her!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?  Then why have an affair?\" she snickered.  \"Anyways, I guess you only have one choice.\" Ginger said.  \"And that is?\" Roger asked.  \"Pay child support.\" she stated.  \"But...Veronica's going to find out!  Ginger, I'm sorry, but I can't!\" Roger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  I suppose there is one other option.  Instead of paying child support, you have to have sex with me whenever I want.  I know you were going to distance yourself from me, so this is really the only option.\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that safe?  I mean, with seven babies and all...\" Roger said.  \"I guess we'll find out...\" Ginger said, taking off her pants.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't just because of their enormous bellies, although that was certainly something to look at. Veronica was roughly halfway through her pregnancy according to her doctor but looked like she was close to literally bursting. Her colossal brown belly was bare and smooth, shining in the mall's lights. Even more shocking was her sister's belly, which was even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat caught everyone's attention was the rest of their bodies. Veronica and Lorenza would have turned heads with their bodies before getting pregnant, with their heaving breasts and plump asses. Now, since drinking Xpect, their curves had become much more pronounced and they were having a hard time finding clothing to conceal their more voluptuous body parts, let alone their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being pregnant at the same time is so weird,\" Veronica said in a small voice, her fingertips never leaving her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenza giggled. \"I guess so but it makes sense if you think about it. As little girls we were inseparable. Some people even thought we were twins. If we didn't get pregnant together, it just wouldn't feel right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pregnancies aren't the exact same,\" Veronica smiled, gazing at Lorenza's enormous mocha tummy. \"You've been pregnant a month longer, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the doctor tells me,\" she sighed. \"Six babies, ay...I don't know how you'll handle seven. I'm freaking out with these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have Roger,\" Veronica said with a small smile. Lorenza couldn't help notice her sister's deceptive look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hermana</i>, you know you can't keep anything from me,\" Lorenza said. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things between Roger and I...feel funny. I can't point to anything specific but we've felt distant,\" Veronica sighed, running her palm up and down her belly as she stared at it, feeling the tiniest flutters inside her massive fleshy mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think because of the pregnancy?\" Lorenza asked, pursing her large, dark lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but I only told him about the baby...I mean, the babies today before we left,\" Veronica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenza chuckled. \"<i>Querido</i> I think he could tell you were expecting before today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was long, long before I even suspected I could be pregnant,\" Veronica said, her voice beginning to tremble. \"I just wish I knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think he might be...\" Lorenza looked around and leaned in to Veronica to whisper. \"An affair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorenza!\" Veronica gasped, her face turning red. \"H-how could you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, maybe it's just the office I work in. Everyone's sleeping with everyone. Well, except me. I have my standards,\" Lorenza huffed. \"But I can always  get a sense about these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy,\" Veronica grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Lorenza sighed. \"I hope so. And besides, look at you.\" Veronica's blush grew as she looked down at her belly. \"I mean...look at you before you started swelling up. How could anyone have an affair behind your back? You're as hot as they come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only saying that because we look so much alike,\" Veronica said with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how I know it's true,\" Lorenza said, puffing out her chest. \"No man's ever slept around on me. I can't think of anyone who would make Roger be unfaithful to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica gulped as one woman appeared in her head: Ginger Goode. Veronica tried not to be vain but she knew how she looked and the only woman in the area she thought could compete with her in physical beauty, besides Lorenza, was Ginger. But would Roger really be so ballsy as to sleep with one of her coworkers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She has been looking rounder around the waist</i> Veronica thought as her sister tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get out mind of things and go shopping,\" Lorenza smiled warmly. \"I feel like getting something that might actually cover my belly up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Veronica nodded, trying to get her mind off of what she assumed was a crazy theory. The two women waddled into the mall's enormous maternity clothing store, only to see the shocked eyes of the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh God, there's more of them,\" the young man said. \"W-welcome ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lorenza smiled with a giggle. \"Got anything that might fit us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly?\" the young man said in a hushed tone. \"I don't think so. But don't tell my manager. She's almost as big as you two and thinks these things look good on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think we'll look good?\" Lorenza purred, leaning in to the front desk, letting her cleavage do the talking for her. Lorenza was far more willing than her sister to use her looks to get a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man gulped and looked like he'd break his neck trying not to look down there. \"O-our larger outfits are in the back if you want to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Veronica said, grabbing her sister by the collar and pulling her back. \"That was a little shameful, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't working anyway,\" Lorenza sighed. \"It's harder to flirt when you're pregnant. But he's right: these all look too tiny for women like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door to the changing room swung open with a slam and the half-naked body of Megan Beverly waddled out, her creamy belly on full display. \"They don't fit! None of them fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan?\" Veronica asked. When she met her co-worker's gaze, Megan's eyes immediately began to water and her lip trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Lopez,\" Megan sobbed, leaping into Veronica's arms. \"It's awful. I thought I could handle being pregnant one more time but...but not this pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh, take it easy,\" Veronica said, leading her into the changing room and shooing her sister away. \"Tell me what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything,\" Megan sniffled. \"I look like a blimp, my husband will barely look at me, I'm exhausted all the time, nothing fits me, no one respects me at school now that I look like a beach ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I respect you,\" Veronica said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, Veronica, but not many people respect you either,\" Megan said, looking up at the school's Spanish teacher. \"Except for me and maybe Ms. Lee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice of you to say,\" Veronica smiled. \"I...may be having some issues with my husband too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he tell you your pregnant body is ugly? And fat? And that's it's gross to be with a pregnant woman?\" Megan said, starting to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look lovely pregnant, Megan. <i>Muy bello</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" Megan said in a small voice, her gaze moving closer to Veronica's. And in an instant, their lips met and hung there before tightening, feeling each other's softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica broke the kiss first, waddling clumsily out of the changing room. \"I-I'm sorry, I can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veronica, I'm so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's...\" Veronica took a deep breath. \"It's fine.\" With that, she moved out of the store as quickly as she could, with Lorenza huffing and puffing to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, bad inventory,\" Veronica said, her face burning as she touched one hand to her lips.</span></div></div>",

However, her main focus was on her belly, which made her look pretty bloated.  Bianca rubbed it, noticing just how firm it was.  \"Please don't be what I think this is...\"she trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was running late for an appointment that was made on short notice by an acquaintance of hers for a teenager.  Between examining the Xpect and worrying about the fact that she might be pregnant, Bianca's mind was boggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca bustled into the kitchen, where she saw Leslie, only donning a bra and panties, devouring a large amount of food.  \"Ah, there you are!  How's the mother of my children doing?\" Bianca said, approaching Leslie to rub her belly and give her a kiss.  Leslie's stomach had grown over the night, making her look nearly due with a single baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving.\" she bluntly replied, barely taking time to breathe.  \"That's good!  You are eating for six after all.\" Bianca noted.  \"I guess so.  How far along did you say I was yesterday?  Seventeen weeks?\" she asked, stopping her binge to feel her babies kicking.  \"Around there, yeah.  Why do you ask?\" Bianca asked, quickly devouring some yogurt that she found in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...it feels like I'm further along than that.\" Leslie said.  \"Huh.  Well, I'm running late.  We'll talk about it later, alright?\" Bianca said, leaving the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca arrived at the office twenty minutes later, and was approached by Jane, one of the many nurses who worked there.  \"Good morning, Bianca.  It's actually two girls you're seeing, Chelsea Matthews and Michelle Stewart.  I already took their weights, and they both seemed really upset about it.\" Jane said, following Bianca down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About their weight or their pregnancy?\" Bianca asked, looking at their charts.  \"Both.  Look, I know you're busy right now, but can we talk after this appointment?  It's...important.\" Jane asked, running her hands through her auburn hair.  Bianca agreed to do so, and entered the examination room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Chelsea and Michelle were sitting on cold angular chairs, their burgeoning bellies showing due to their ill-fitting clothes.  \"Sorry I'm late, girls.  So you both think you're pregnant?\" Bianca asked, her eyes glued to the charts.  \"Seriously?  Have you seen our stomachs?\" Michelle asked.  \"Yeah, sorry.  Just a bit preoccupied.  So how long have you thought you've been pregnant?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...what, the fifth day?\" Chelsea asked Michelle, who nodded in confirmation.  \"Five days and you're this big already?  Actually, that reminds me of my girlfriend...\" Bianca noted.  \"Wait, is your girlfriend Ms. Lee?\" Michelle asked.  \"Yes!  You know her?\" Bianca asked, retrieving two ultrasound machines from the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's our biology teacher.  Congrats on the pregnancy, by the way!  You excited to be a mom?\" Michelle asked, rolling up the part of her shirt that was covering her pregnant belly as Bianca turned the machines on.  \"What?  Uh--I'm not pregnant!  Oh, you were talking about Leslie, weren't you?  Yes, I'm very excited.\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been quiet.  Are you alright?\" Bianca asked Chelsea.  \"Just nervous, that's all.\" Chelsea said, not sure if the butterflies in her stomach were from the nerves or the pregnancy.  \"Chelsea, I've met hundreds of women who've felt the same way you have, and end up loving being pregnant.  You'll be fine.\" Bianca smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe maneuvered the ultrasound wands around both of their bellies.  \"Well, you're both about 22 weeks pregnant.\" Bianca stated.  \"So...is it just one each?\" Chelsea asked.  \"I'm still counting.\" Bianca said, trying to come to a conclusion.  \"Looks like six fetuses.\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, triplets?!?\" Michelle asked.  \"No, six each!  You're both having sextuplets.\" Bianca concluded.  \"Six...Oh, god...what am I gonna tell Zack?  Or my dad?\" Chelsea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they'll understand.  Multiples are tough for any woman, but you and the babies are both in good enough shape to not worry about anything.  Just relax.\" Bianca said, giving the two pregnant teens pamphlets.  She bid Chelsea and Michelle farewell, and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was waiting outside, looking visibly nervous.  \"You wanted to talk to me, Jane?\" Bianca asked.  \"I...I was wondering if you could give me an ultrasound?\" Jane asked.  \"Sure.  But only if you give me one, too.\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cold examination room, Jane revealed her swollen belly to Bianca, which was previously hidden by her scrubs.  Bianca conducted the ultrasound, and she herself was shocked at the results.  \"Jane...you're three months pregnant with octuplets!\" Bianca exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca expected Jane to be in disbelief, but she was proven wrong when a smile slowly creeped across her face.  \"I...I can't believe it!  My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for years, but the fertility experts said it wasn't possible!\" Jane exclaimed, tears of joy streaming down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Jane.  I guess we should find out how many buns are in my oven, huh?\" Bianca asked, trading places with Jane.  She rolled her shirt up, exposing her slightly protruding middle.  \"Well, you're about two months pregnant with quints.  That's the same number of babies that Leslie's having, right?  What are the odds of that?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the past few days I've had, anything's possible.\" Bianca said, rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

And why wouldn't we?\" Michelle said, rolling up her shirt with one hand while the other gripped a fast food burger. \"It makes no sense that we'd get this pregnant this quickly. It doesn't even make sense that <u>I'd</u> get pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Chelsea nodded, eating a few fries while she looked down at her swollen middle. She, unlike Michelle, had been sexually active and she wondered whether the babies \u2014 the actual number she was carrying was still too much for her to wrap her head around \u2014 were Zack's or if they'd ended up in her womb some other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their ultrasound, the two friends needed a quiet place to sit and take in what they'd learned about themselves. And after detour to satisfy their cravings, they went back to their high school and sat out on the bleachers. Football practice was already over and they had the whole place to themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell your dad and Zack?\" Michelle asked, turning to Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my dad may already know. Or at least be suspicious,\" Chelsea sighed. \"He saw the...the belly and it's not hard to figure out what's making it so big and round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think Zack already knows too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he hasn't gotten a good look at it,\" Chelsea said, rubbing up and down her sides, feeling little vibrations of movement inside her. \"Besides, he's...not really that smart so I don't know if he'd get the right idea at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle gave a little laugh. \"Anyone who dated Becky can't be <i>that</i> smart.\" She saw Chelsea's face start to grow more forlorn and scooted over. \"H-hey, I didn't mean that to sound so mean, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just...would he even stay with me when he finds out I'm pregnant?\" Chelsea said, gripping the sides of her massive ball of tight flesh. \"Or will he just go back to Becky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't be like that,\" Michelle said, wrapping one arm around Chelsea's shoulders. \"You two have been together for a long time and you go so well together. And if he would seriously leave you when you're pregnant with his kids, then...then good riddance! He was no good to begin with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Chelsea said in a tiny voice, trying to hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, you still look totally hot,\" Michelle grinned. \"I wish my pregnancy agreed with me as much as yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, stop. You look great,\" Chelsea smiled, looking back at her friend. \"Trust me. Any guy'd be lucky to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle rolled her eyes. \"They'd have be be someone with a pregnancy fetish, if that kind of thing even exists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure,\" Chelsea snickered. \"The Internet's full of people who are in to all kinds of stuff. You're probably someone's Marilyn Monroe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with my luck, they don't go to our school,\" Michelle sighed, finishing off her burger and groaning. \"Ugh, maybe we need some new clothes, Chelsea. I'm on the verge of needing to unzip these pants if we eat anymore. By tomorrow, I probably won't even fit in my own bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention our prom dresses,\" Chelsea sighed. \"We may have to get some new ones. I know we'd planned on renting those two but...there must be some others. We can't be the first pregnant girls to go to their high school prom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle chuckled and nodded. \"Let's go there then. I want to look good for tonight if I'm going to be the Prom Queen's right-hand woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends arrived at the mall's dress rental store, their faces bright red as they waddled up to the counter. \"Hello,\" the young man there said with a smile. \"How can I help you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We placed an order for prom dresses for tonight,\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, tonight's the big night,\" the young man chuckled. \"I go to Sunnydale too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're both on the cheerleading team. Chelsea and...Zoe, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Michelle,\" Michelle said with a little smile, elbowing Chelsea. \"Guess you're the famous one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't recognize you,\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not surprising,\" he laughed. \"I kinda keep to myself. I'm Jonathan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Michelle grinned, the two of them meeting eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Chelsea said, stepping between the two, \"Jonathan, can you...keep a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he shrugged. \"I've talked to you two more than anyone else at school all year so I don't have many people to blab to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle and I are,\" Chelsea cleared her throat. \"p-pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan peered over the counter and his face turned red. \"O-oh...yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the dresses we'd planned to rent probably won't be all that comfortable on us now,\" Chelsea said. \"Do you have anything that'd...fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're in luck,\" Jonathan said, hurrying from behind his counter to a back rack. \"The Southdale High prom was a week ago and they also had quite a few p-pregnant students too and my manager ordered a bunch of maternity dresses.\" He took one long dark red dress off. \"How does this look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" Chelsea nodded, taking it from Jonathan. \"I'll go try this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got another one like that?\" Michelle asked with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I think this would look better on you,\" Jonathan said, handing Michelle a backless black dress with some reflective material around the shoulders and waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Michelle said, looking it over. \"Well you're the expert here, I guess. At the homecoming tonight I'll have to see what you think of everyone else's outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going,\" Jonathan said with a nervous laugh. \"I don't have anyone to go with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't have anyone either but I'm still going,\" Michelle smiled. \"It's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...if you don't have someone...we could go together?\" Jonathan said, his blush growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's cheeks got a little hot in return. \"You'd want to be seen with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should ask you the same thing about me,\" Jonathan smiled. \"B-besides, with that dress on, you'd be the best looking girl at the dance. Don't tell your friend I said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle!\" Chelsea called from the changing room. \"Tell me how this looks, would ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-here,\" Michelle said, shakily throwing her phone to Jonathan. \"Put your number in, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jonathan nodded as Michelle waddled away. He looked around the store and sighed. \"I guess I'll need to look up a tux rental store now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Susan Brown ended her call with Grant Buckman and continued to stare at her figure in the mirror.  For a 55 year old, she was in pretty good shape, as she did exercise every day before school began.  But that was before she had become mysteriously pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts and butt had gotten larger, that was true, but her belly made her look seven months pregnant.  And she was certain that she was pregnant.  If the multiple positive pregnancy tests weren't a good enough indication, the kicks that she had been feeling this morning were all she needed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her grey spandex exercise outfit, her stomach looked more like a small moon than anything else.  She was able to do a few basic exercises earlier, but didn't want to do anything too strenuous in an effort to not get her or whatever was quickly growing in her womb hurt.  As far as Susan could tell, the easier workout did no harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her little meltdown yesterday afternoon, Susan went home and called her doctor to schedule an appointment.  She was very vague about the reason for the appointment, and told the receptionist that she was having stomach problems, which was a bit of an understatement.  Susan knew that if she told her doctor that she was pregnant, he'd never believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan removed her spandex outfit and went to her closet.  To her bemusement, nothing she owned fit.  \"Damn this all!  I'm going to have to get some bigger clothes after the appointment!\" she exclaimed, huffing as she felt kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to just wear a bra, which could barely contain her blossoming breasts, and a pair of underwear.  Susan grabbed the largest coat she owned, which surprisingly hid her belly well.  She headed out, nervous about the appointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving to the doctor's office right on time, she checked in with the receptionist, her hands stuffed into her coat to hide her belly even more.  \"Alright, just take a seat and a nurse should be with you in a moment.  Are those stomach problems persisting?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's putting it lightly...\" Susan muttered, taking a seat.  A few minutes later, her name was called by a nurse, who had a burgeoning middle of her own.  Susan followed her into a nearby examination room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Susan.  Before Dr. Ponder can see you I need to take your weight.  That coat looks like it'll add some weight to it, so would you mind removing it for me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'd rather not.  Personal reasons.\" Susan replied, giving a nervous laugh.  The nurse looked at her skeptically.  \"Alright, then.  I won't pry any further.  Step on the scale, please.\" the nurse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan obliged, and waited for the nurse to come to a conclusion.  \"That's...interesting.  You've gained thirty pounds since your visit two months ago.\" the nurse noted.  \"R-really?\" Susan asked.  She knew that she had gained SOME weight with the pregnancy, but not that much.  \"Yeah.  Must be all muscle, huh?  The doctor will be with you shortly.\" the nurse said, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a brief wait, Dr. Ponder entered the room.  She was a grey-haired woman in her early 60s, whom Susan considered to be an acquaintance.  Not a friend, though.  Susan was too busy for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Susan.  So you say you've been having stomach problems?\" the doctor asked.  \"In a way, yes.  But there was another reason why I scheduled the appointment.  I'm pregnant.\" Susan said, fearing the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, Susan.  Really, what's going on?\" Dr. Ponder asked.  \"No, I am being serious.  I am pregnant.\" she repeated.  \"I'm sorry, but that's not possible for a woman for your age.  Especially since you've been through menopause.  And, if you don't mind me asking, when was the last time you had sex?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.  I'm a virgin.  But I swear I am!  Look!\" Susan said, removing her coat to reveal her round belly to the doctor.  \"Oh...what the hell...\" the doctor said.  \"So do you believe me now?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie back for one moment.\" the doctor said, as Susan did so.  Dr. Ponder began to feel Susan's belly, noticing how firm it was.  This continued for a while, until kicking emitted from her pregnant belly, making the doctor gasp in shock.  \"Excuse me for one moment.\" Dr. Ponder said, obviously shaken up at the whole predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned a few moments later with an ultrasound machine.  \"I have no idea how this happened, but we're going to see what's really going on.\" Dr. Ponder said, starting the process.  She maneuvered the wand around Susan's taut belly for a minute or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Dr. Ponder trailed, her jaw dropped.  \"What?  Is the baby alright?\" Susan asked.  \"Susan, it isn't just one baby.  You're having triplets!\" the doctor stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets?  Three?!?\" Susan asked.  She knew that she was pregnant, as it was impossible to ignore, but three babies at her age was going to be hard to handle.  \"It looks like it.  All boys.  I'd say you're roughly five months along.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor handed her a few pamphlets to Susan, and sent her on her way.  Susan drove home in stunned silence.  When she got home, she pulled out some ice cream from the fridge and began to eat, hating that she was giving into her craving.  She ate most of the carton, and was interrupted when she heard the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan?\" a voice called out, who she recognized as Grant's.  \"In the kitchen.\" she said, continuing to eat.  \"Sorry for coming by uninvited, but I wanted to talk more about...Susan?\" Grant said, surprised at her lack of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about Xpect?  Sure, why not?\" Susan said, turning around to reveal her pregnancy to Grant, who gasped in shock.  \"Uhh...belly...\" was all Grant could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great observation skills, Grant!  If you couldn't tell, I'm pregnant.  And guess what?  I'm having triplets!  And I'm 55!  Isn't that great?\" Susan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...I pick a bad time to stop by?\" Grant asked.  \"That would be a wise deduction.  Leave.  Now.\" Susan said, ushering Grant out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was left alone in her house, barely clothed, and to top it all off was five months pregnant with triplets.  To put it bluntly, she needed somebody so she wouldn't feel so alone.  Waddling over to her couch, she picked up her phone and dialed Grant's number, hoping that he would come back.</span></div></div>",

Her friend nodded silently while she clutched her big pregnant belly and Michelle smiled back. \"I'm sure he'll understand. You've got a cool dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Chelsea said in a quiet voice, not fully convinced by Michelle's characterization. \"I guess I'll see you at the dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep and hopefully I'll have someone with me too,\" Michelle grinned. Chelsea smiled back, glad Michelle managed to find someone recently. She waved as her friend drove away and took in a big breath and walked back into the house. Chelsea's father was still sitting in the living room and he had a frustrated look on his face when he saw his pregnant daughter waddle back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi dad,\" Chelsea said weakly, one hand against her round stomach. With her top, about half of her belly was still visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, I need to talk with you,\" he said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea nodded and waddled into the room to see him, choosing to stand instead of sit down, since she knew once she got down it was hard to get up. \"I wanted to talk with you too, dad. As you can probably see...I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, tell me it's not true,\" he said, cutting her off. \"Tell me it's some sort of prank or some weight gain or the school is having you wear a fake belly as part of health class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it wasn't real,\" Chelsea said, rolling up her shirt to reveal her entire bare, smooth belly. \"But it is. Dad, I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father buried his face in his hands, letting out a long sigh. \"How did you keep it hidden from me for so long? I've seen you before and you didn't look like...like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Chelsea said, her lips starting to wobble as she got worked up. \"It just appeared over the last few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, don't lie to me,\" her father grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not! I'm as confused by this as you are,\" Chelsea said, now holding both hands against her belly as she felt movement inside her. \"Great, now they're starting to kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They?\" Her father said, clearing his throat. He knew his daughter looked a little too big, but still, he wasn't expecting twins. \"How many are you carrying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle and I got our ultrasounds today,\" Chelsea said, biting her lip to keep it from shaking. \"We're having sextuplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle too?\" her father said. \"Wait...sextuplets?\" If he'd been standing up, he'd have fallen into his seat by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said dad, I don't understand a lot of this,\" Chelsea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you use protection when you have sex?\" her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea froze and hesitated before responding. \"N-not always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea, I told you to be careful. I wish you were still my little girl but I know you're becoming a woman so I want you to have a healthy emotional life but you have to be responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Michelle is pregnant and she's still a virgin!\" Chelsea yelled. \"And Mary and Abigail too! And a lot of teachers at school are pregnant! Something weird is going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear any excuses for right now!\" her father barked back. \"I said you have to be responsible. Have you thought about how you'd raise the babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea sighed. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the father even know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father groaned and gripped his temples. \"If your mother was here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Chelsea began to sob and ran to the stairs. \"Don't bring mom into this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea slammed the door to her room and cried and cried, her hands clutching her pregnant belly. Quickly, she stripped out of her regular clothes and stood in front of the mirror, gazing at her belly. In just a few days, she'd been transformed into a new, maternal woman with a swollen middle that seemed impossibly big. And she had the sense that it would only get bigger as the days went on. And at the end, Chelsea would be a mother. It was all so strange and, in a way, too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unwrapped her prom dress and slipped it on. Like Jonathan had told her at the rental store, it looked beautiful on her but Chelsea also noticed one thing: it didn't full fit her. A sliver of Chelsea's pregnant belly still stuck out. Chelsea began to cry again as she clutched her hands to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I have to get pregnant? Why did all this chaos have to come into my life?\" Chelsea cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chelsea?\" her father said at the door, knocking lightly. Chelsea turned around and waited. \"Are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here,\" Chelsea scoffed back. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to talk,\" he said. \"Please, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea stood and thought about it for a moment before waddling over and opening the door. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's angry face went away when she saw that her father had also been crying. \"Chelsea, when I brought up mom, I didn't mean to shame you. I just meant she'd know just what to do say. Much better than I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea wiped her eyes. \"C'mon dad, I understand how you must feel. No one wants their teenage daughter to end up pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she'd still help you out to be a mother. And in a way, she'd actually be proud of you,\" he smiled. \"Here, I want you to have this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea gasped when her father handed her a framed picture of Chelsea's mother when she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to give this to you as a graduation present but I thought, considering what's happening-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea hugged her father tightly, tears streaming down her face. \"Thank you, dad. Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Chelsea,\" he said, hugging her back, feeling his grandchildren kick against him. \"And if you say a lot of other kids are mysteriously pregnant, I think I'll have a talk with the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dad,\" Chelsea said, rolling her eyes with a smile. \"You do what you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you look very nice in your dress,\" her father smiled. Chelsea giggled and closed the door before turning to the mirror and running her hands down her sides. Even with the little bit of belly showing, Chelsea had to agree. She looked good.</span></div></div>",

What are we going to do with these babies when they're born? How are we going to take care of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will happen to the two of us?\" Mary said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Abigail said, starting to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Mary said, reaching one hand over to rest over Abigail's. \"What will happen to <u>us</u>?\" Abigail moved her hand away from Mary's and looked away. \"Oh\u2026I thought we were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Abigail sighed. \"But it's still hard for me. All my life I thought and believed this kind of relationship was wrong but now\u2026\" She looked down at her belly. \"Maybe all these babies is God's way of punishing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now babies are punishments? That's a new one,\" Mary giggled but she saw that Abigail was only looking more distressed. \"Look, Abigail, I like you a lot and I know you feel the same way. We'll find some way to stay together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even raising these babies?\" Abigail said, turning back to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure our parents would help us. My mom raised me and my siblings so how much harder can 10 or more babies be?\" Mary said. Abigail was about to correct her new lover but just rolled her eyes instead, choosing to avoid the hassle of explaining things to Mary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt my parents would want to help,\" Abigail said in a sour tone. \"It'd bad enough that I'm pregnant without being married but if I added in that I'm in love with another\u2026another woman, there's no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Mary said in a small voice. \"I mean\u2026they're your parents. You're their daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Abigail said. There was a long silence after that before Abigail spoke up again. \"What about adoption?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up our babies?\" Mary said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not\u2026they're not our babies, Mary. They suddenly appeared in our bellies and it doesn't make sense how they got here,\" Abigail said. \"At least this way they'd go to some families who could take care of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno\u2026things could still be hard for them,\" Mary said, moving her hand as she felt a kick around the curve of her belly. \"Though we should figure something out soon. We keep getting bigger each day. How much longer could this go on for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail sighed and kept her eyes on her own belly. \"And about us staying together\u2026are you sure that's such a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary felt her heart sink. \"W-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we're talking about all this like we'd definitely be together forever but we're just in high school. That's a big commitment,\" Abigail said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary felt her lower lip tremble. \"You\u2026you think you'd break up with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Abigail said, her eyes starting to water. \"You make me feel a way I've never felt before. But it's just a big risk, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary put one hand on Abigail's shoulder. \"Abby\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just\u2026my parents got married out of high school and when I see my mom, she seems so miserable,\" Abigail said, tears starting to roll down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary hugged Abigail tighter. \"We won't be like that. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail laughed and wiped her tears as she pressed her hand against Mary's belly. \"We really are getting huge, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have to start showing off my belly to fit into my clothes,\" Mary laughed. \"I guess I'm not going to the dance tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going anyway,\" Abigail scoffed. \"My parents called it 'sinful.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can have our own little dance,\" Mary smiled, kissing Abigail on the forehead. \"What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound nice,\" Abigail said, sitting up and letting her lips gently touch Mary's.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now just a few hours before the dance, Chelsea was doing some last minute preparations.  She made sure her hair and makeup was just right, as she wanted to look as best as she could.  Well, as best as a high school senior five months pregnant with sextuplets could look.  As she was in the bathroom putting on some finishing touches to her mascara, she got a call from Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked.  \"Hey, baby.  Listen, I'm not gonna be able to meet you at Michelle's to take pictures.  The guys wanted to get dinner together before the dance.  I'll see you there, okay?\" Zack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Yeah, alright.  Are you feeling alright?\" Chelsea asked, noticing that his voice seemed a bit weaker than usual.  \"Well...I was sick the past couple of days, but I was fine for the most part today.  Listen, I'm getting a little hungry so I'm gonna go head to the restaurant now so I'll be there a little early.  Love you.\" he said, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she thought that his illness was a little suspicious, she quickly brushed it off and dialed Michelle's number.  They exchanged pleasantries, and began their conversation.  \"What's up?\" Michelle asked.  \"Could you give me a ride to your house?  Zack's hanging out with some of the other football players, and I'm not exactly used to driving with a pregnant belly.\" Chelsea said.  \"Sure!  I'll be there soon!\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea finished getting ready and waddled to her bed to take a seat.  She felt her babies kicking, and began to realize that this pregnancy was real.  She was going to be a mom.  And for her, it was going to be hard to do without her mom to guide her along the way.  Chelsea's train of thought was interrupted by her doorbell ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Michelle!\" she said to herself, bolting out of her room.  As she exited her room, she heard a distinct ripping sound, followed by the feeling of her dress getting much looser.  Chelsea turned her head, and saw that her dress had gotten caught on the doorknob, completely ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" Chelsea gasped, holding the tattered remains of her dress.  She waddled to her closet and found her bright green, formfitting pre-pregnancy dress.  \"Well, here goes nothing...\" she sighed, pulling the dress on with all of her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a legitimate struggle, but after many attempts she was able to get it on.  However, if she so much as breathed out too much, she knew that the dress would rip like her previous one.  Her belly stuck out like a sore thumb, and her breasts were nearly heaving out of the dress.  Needless to say, it wasn't a great look for Chelsea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, she could hear the sound of growing, loud footsteps coming from the stairs, followed by a familiar voice.  \"Hey, Chelsea!  Just had a nice convo with your da--OH GOD, CHELSEA!\" Michelle shouted, taken back by her friend's choice of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...my other dress ripped...\" Chelsea muttered.  \"Oh, sorry about that.  Well, I think you look great!\" Michelle said, patting Chelsea on the shoulder.  Chelsea thanked Michelle, and the two exited the house and headed to Michelle's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief drive, the two pregnant cheerleaders reached their destination.  \"So Jonathan and I have already taken our pictures, so it'll just be you and me.\" Michelle said.  \"So...Jonathan.  You like him?\" Michelle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.  I mean, I think he's...interested in the belly.  But he seems cool.\" Michelle replied.  \"Right.  Well, just be careful with the post-dance festivities.  Wouldn't want an unplanned pregnancy, would we?\" Chelsea asked, as the two shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed inside, and were greeted by Michelle's parents, as Jonathan was standing nearby.  The two began to do multiple poses as Michelle's mom took photos.  \"So, Chelsea, is the pregnancy going well so far?\" she asked.  \"As good as a sextuplet pregnancy can go, sure.  So you guys are alright with <i>this</i>?\"  Chelsea asked, gesturing to her and Michelle's bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Michelle explained to us that this wasn't exactly a natural pregnancy, so of course we supported her.  And you, for that matter.\" Michelle's father said.  Michelle's parents were always considered to be cool, at least by Chelsea's standards, so them being supportive wasn't all too surprising.  At least her father was beginning to come around to her impending motherhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief conversation, which included Michelle's mom giving Chelsea a few tips about the pregnancy, she left with Michelle and Jonathan, heading off to the Homecoming dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was 9:00 on a Sunday night when Lindsay Walker sat down to grade her 4th graders' papers from the weekend.  Actually grading the papers didn't take too long, but she liked to make comments or suggestions on them, often encouraging, and that ate the bulk of her grading time.  Her husband Carl was still in Europe.  He was the top salesman for his firm, and any major potential client, local, national, or international, he was often the first one to be sent over.  They did miss each other, but Carl always loved traveling and Lindsay could immerse herself in her work with her students, and both found their careers rewarding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a short weekend and Lindsay was not exactly looking forward to the upcoming week.  There would be a parent-teacher meeting on Wednesday, but her school was not a large one, and the parents mostly good-natured folks, that that would actual be a relaxing way to spend the Wednesday afternoon.  It meant that she had to finish her grading tonight or risk lazily doing it tomorrow before school.  Lindsay was so focused on this that she didn't hear the door open downstairs, her husband dropping his bags by the door and then walking upstairs slowly and quietly, perhaps thinking she might be asleep or dozing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was 36, the same age as her husband minus a few months, and had been teaching middle school since she had graduated college at 22.  She was a smart, patient, and confident teacher, traits that made her match for her sometimes rambunctious students.  She was also stunningly beautiful, having long, wavy red hair, smooth pale skin, and a slim, toned figure that had hardly changed since high school.  Her husband, himself moderately attractive if starting to show he was nearing middle age, never got tired of seeing her after a long trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her falling asleep over the papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not one of those teachers that assigns homework over the weekend, are you?\" he said, leaning against the doorway crossing his arms and holding a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Lindsay blinked and yawned, then stood smiling broadly when she saw him.  \"You weren't supposed to be coming back until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We closed the deal early, and they've got another big contract in Buffalo they wanted me to come home to HQ so I can head out there next week.  Also, hi!\" they embraced, ending with a tired but thankful kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you made it back,\" Lindsay said, sitting back down again, yawning louder this time.  \"I was just grading papers.  The big PTA meeting is on Wednesday so I won't have time then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, those,\" Carl said, taking off his blazer and tossing it messily onto the closet floor, \"I don't believe you, by the way.  I don't think any parent that actual goes to a PTA meeting is there for anything other than having some kind of soccer mom power trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay smirked.  \"They're not like that there.  Mostly, at least.\"  She yawned, stretching her whole body.  Carl looked her over, admiringly.  If he hadn't just gotten off of a fourteen hour flight he could have gone some good married sex right about then.  Maybe tomorrow, he thought with a self-approving nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Lindsay asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got you some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, this is some kind of antique ring I found in a store that the CEO over there kept talking about.  The owner assures me it's not cursed, but he kept winking at me as he said it so I'm not sure I believe him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely,\" Lindsay said, taking it in her hand.  She tried it on to see if it fit, flashed it at her husband, and then put it safely away in her jewelry box to wear on some other occasion perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this, uh, well, this I just picked up over there.  It's not for sale here yet.  It's supposed to be an energy drink that's not horribly unhealthy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Lindsay a tall can.  It was mostly plain, except for the words XPect printed in stylized font on it.  Lindsay had a weakness for coffee with a lot of sugar, soda, and energy drinks.  She avoided them for health reasons, but every one in a while if she just had to be up late or couldn't get started in the morning, she'd give in.  A healthy energy drink, while a somewhat weird gift to most wives, was actual somewhat thoughtful in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thank you,\" she said, taking it and popping the top.  \"I still have a good two hours to go here, I'll need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hours?\" Carl said with a mock sneer, \"Yeah, good luck with that.\"  He turned to go to bed.  Lindsay grabbed his hand playfully and stood up to kiss him good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you just had a long flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did.  I'm hitting the sack,\" Carl said, walking out of the room.  \"Feel free to wake me when you come in, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" Lindsay turned and went back to her papers.  She sniffed the drink.  It was lightly carbonated, but didn't have any real discernible soda.  She took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" she said after a tiny sip.  There was a hint of bitterness to it.  She continued writing on the papers and then took a larger gulp.  This time the bitterness was almost overpowering.  She swallowed, but gagged, coughing a little.  Giving it just one more chance, she drank a few more sips slowly, probably finishing half the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regretted it immediately.  Her face contorted as an inadvisable combination of sourness and bitterness filled her mouth.  She set the can aside shaking her head.  It might be healthy, but nobody was going to drink this disgusting thing.  It didn't taste good to begin with, and tasted even worse when combined with its own awful aftertaste.  Lindsey turned back to her papers, her hand rubbing her flat stomach as it gurgled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guuuuurgle-glump!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay leaned forward with a moan, wrapping her arms around her middle.  A wave of nausea swept over her, not helped by her stomach acting up.  It felt like it was trying to turn over, leap upward, and jump out of her all at once.  With another sickening groan welling up inside her, it was the leaping upward part that now concerned her.  Lindsay sprang to her feet, still crouching forward, and hobbled to the office bathroom.  She fell to her knees and vomited into the toilet without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained with her face over it for a few moments, occasionally another surge of bubbling nausea welled up inside her, and she found herself again throwing up.  She wrapped her arms tightly around her stomach.  It was still squirming inside her, but the sick feeling was going away.  After a half hour of vomiting, dry heaving, and finally just waiting, Lindsay stood up, drank some water, and went back to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, her stomach finally returned to normal, mostly.  Of course it wasn't going to feel perfect after that, but it didn't feel quite right.  She should have felt empty, but Lindsay had the odd impression that her abdomen was fuller than it should.  Rubbing her quietly gurgling stomach, Lindsay returned to her papers.  It took a little longer than it should have with the interruption.  She found her husband fast asleep as predicted.  She toyed with the idea of waking him up.  That drink had made her pretty sick pretty quickly, and even though it passed she wasn't completely sure she was totally fine now.  She massaged her tummy, which was still groaning and hiccuping a little.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her upset stomach, Lindsay drifted off to sleep quickly.  She slept deeply and was dreaming almost immediately . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lindsay found herself in the teachers' lounge at work, sitting at a table reading a book and drinking coffee.  Her long time friend and coworker Amy came by and took a seat.  There was something different about her, but in her dream state Lindsay couldn't tell what it was.  Amy looked excited, a bright smile on her cute face.  In fact, she looked better than usual.  She was slim and healthy, and Lindsay realized she hadn't seen her looking like that in a while.  In real life, Amy was pregnant, ready to give birth in a matter of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not pregnant anymore,\" Lindsay said pointing her finger as if she just solved a great mystery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Amy stood up and did a little twirl.  Lindsay nodded, impressed.  Pregnancy had not been kind to Amy.  Aside from the usual changes any pregnant woman goes through, Amy was putting on more weight than was normal, and had gotten all around chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great!\" Lindsay said, putting her book down, \"How did you lose the weight so fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it just melted off,\" Amy said with a laugh, \"Feels good, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the baby?\" Lindsay asked, as if she just realized that to not be pregnant anymore Amy must have given birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash Amy was at Lindsay's side with her hand over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lindsay asked, and attempted to remove her friend's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lindsay pushed Amy's hands away, her stomach groaned loudly and pushed like she had taken a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" she cooed involuntarily.  She rubbed her tummy herself.  It had puffed out and not gone back down.  The buttons on her blouse around her middle strained, as did the belt holding her skirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not far along yet to feel kicking,\" Amy said, taking her seat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinday's stomach once again groaned and pushed outward, going from puffy to round.  Her belt slid down, tightening painfully, while on button over her naval popped off.  She wheezed and leaned back, grasping her stomach tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not pregnant,\" Lindsay finally said, as her stomach yet again rounded further, popping the rest of the buttons off her blouse and causing her belt and shirt to snap open in the front.  She yelped.  She looked four, maybe five months pregnant now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't get pregnant,\" Lindsay stammered, but couldn't deny she looked the part.  She tried to tug her shirt back together but her stomach was much too large now.  She stood up and stumbled into the table.  Amy was already up and helping her stand.  Lindsay's back creaked as it adjusted to the new eight up front.  She steadied herself on the table just in time for her belly to bulge forward, pressing into the table and causing Lindsay to stumble backwards with a short cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible!\" Lindsay yelled, breathing heavily from the new weight inside her.  Surprisingly, she didn't panic just yet.  She felt, and saw, movements inside her belly, which she rubbed to settle it.  \"What's wrong with me?\" she asked Amy, who was smiling sweetly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, it's normal-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lindsay grabbed her belly tighter as a full, stretching feeling filled it.  She winced and moaned as her stomach rounded out further, growing heavier, tighter, forcing her to spread her legs to remain standing.  But the weight was getting too much.  Her skirt split down the side as her hips widened to adjust, and she fell into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's-it's-\" she panted as her belly button popped out, the top of her blouse losing its top buttons as her small breasts swelled painfully.  Stretch marks appeared on the side of her increasingly massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Amy asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not stopping!\" Lindsay screamed as the chair buckled under her weight.  Her legs spread out to accommodate her new girth, the skin all across her belly growing shiny and taut.  She tried to lean back more but only fell off the chair, lying on the floor.  She lifted herself onto her elbows and saw her giant, quivering belly growing in spurts every second.  She wanted to scream for it to stop but couldn't get enough air.  Amy knelt down next to her, concerned but nearly as scared as Lindsay was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, this is normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay almost got the words \"this isn't normal out\" but just as a deep, sharp pain began radiating all over her belly she awoke . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay woke up to her alarm, sweating and shaking.  She found her hands pressed firmly against her firm tummy through the t-shirt she had worn to bed.  She must have been sleeping deeper than she thought, since she hadn't woken up Carl.  Still shaking from the dream, Lindsay got out of bed and prepared for the day.  Something felt different, but much like Amy in her dream she couldn't tell what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream upset Lindsay more than she would have thought.  When her and Carl were married in their 20s they had tried to have kids, but Lindsay couldn't.  It wasn't a particularly tough blow for them.  They both liked children enough, but Carl traveled a lot, and Lindsay had enough to worry about with her students, so they got over the disappointment without difficulty.  Still, Lindsay did occasionally wonder what it'd be like to have one of her own.  After seeing how tough Amy's pregnancy was for her, Lindsay could at least add that one plus to not having kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay showered, brushed her long red hair, brushed her teeth, feeling something different about her body all the while.  It slowly downed on her as she looked in the mirror that her breasts didn't usually wobble that much.  In fact, they were fairly small, at least under average size, but now they felt heavier, swollen even.  Her t-shirt, which normally wasn't tight but clung to her loosely, was actually a little stretched around her breasts.  She felt them in her hands.  They were tender, almost sour, and definitely rounder and heavier than they should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point was brought home when she dressed.  Her bra was restrictive, almost painfully so, and she had to wear it at its second loosest setting.  Adjusting her bra, or any of her clothes for that matter, was something she hadn't done since she was a teenager.  She wondered if she was finally starting to gain weight.  She was in her mid-30s now, after all.  She couldn't keep her perfect 20-something body forever, after all.  The thought would have depressed her a little, but she put on her shirt, and fashionable belt, and a dress shirt.  Other than the buttons being a little tight up top, the outfit fit perfect as usual, and she looked to be her same, slender self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to lessen any notice of what she felt were now her giant breasts, Lindsay wore a sweater for good measure.  She went downstairs to start the day, letting Carl sleep off his long flight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Years of sticking to lesson plans had given Lindsay a very good sense of sticking to a well timed schedule.  When Lindsay went downstairs to make breakfast, she knew it would be around ten minutes of preparation and maybe five or ten of eating.  She wasn't a big eater, never had been, but as she went to the kitchen her stomach was rumbling loudly.  She realized just how hungry she was.  It was better than the nausea she went to bed with, but was unusual for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay proceeded to make some eggs and sausage, the scent sending her tummy into a whirlwind of anticipation.  She patted it softly as she rushed to finish cooking.  She had never heard sounds like that come from her, or felt as hungry as she did.  Eating proved equally strange, as every bite made her crave even more.  She had gulped down her usual breakfast, then got up to make even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is with me today?</i> she asked herself, holding her flat, growling stomach in her hand as she poured more sausage on the stove, adding some bacon now for good measure.  If she wasn't careful she'd run out.  She finished another helping of both, but her stomach still wasn't satisfied.  She burped softly.  She was definitely full already, and while she knew all the grease she had just consumed would probably pay her back with an upset stomach she just wanted more.  She threw some waffles in the toaster and, despite misgivings that this was way, way too much food for her to eat, finished up the rest of the bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Lindsay found herself finally able to stop eating.  The hunger had subsided, now replaced with a satisfied, stuffed feeling.  And she was quite stuffed.  She rubbed her stomach through her shirt.  It felt hard, and a little puffy.  Lindsay moaned loudly between little burps.  She had never eaten like that in her entire life.  Even her arms were a little tired from cramming food into her mouth for a full hour.  She must have put away a pound of sausage and bacon, each, and not to mention the eggs and waffles she had packed in.  It was no wonder her stomach felt hard as a rock under her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh great,</i> Lindsay said to herself with concern, <i>Well, this explains my bra being tight this morning.  Have I been eating like this a lot lately?</i>  She inwardly shuddered as she soothed her stuffed tummy.  <i>I have to get this under control now that I know it's happening,</i> she thought.  Lindsay wasn't a vain person, but she was a healthy, thin, and beautiful one, and she did not want to get fat.  Gaining weight would be a new experience she'd rather avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her blouse just a little too tight around her chest, and her stomach rubbing a stomach too full and feeling kind of tight as well, Lindsay gathered her papers and set out to work.  It was after 7:00, so as long as there were no more interruptions Lindsay would be on time as usual.  Still, she moved more sluggish than usual, which she attributed to her night of nausea and her morning of stuffing herself with grease and fat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay fidgeted in her seat the entire ride to work, tugging at her bra straps and shirt.  Worse yet, her breasts were feeling so sensitive that just brushing her hand against them sent a shiver through her.  It was bad enough that she was sleepier than usual, but she was feeling completely off and distracted.  She hadn't gone a mile down the road when her stomach rumbled.  It came on so suddenly, signaled by a loud, deep growl, that she lurched forward and grabbed her stomach.  She was already full.  It was impossible that she could be hungry, especially this hungry, so soon after eating a much too big breakfast.  Fast food places, with promises of cheap and greasy breakfast meals, suddenly looked quite appetizing to the usual healthy eater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, I'll work it off starting tonight,\" Lindsay muttered to herself as she swerved into a parking lot, cutting off several cars from both lanes.  The honking and yelling the proceeded irritated much more than it normally would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay couldn't help but feel embarrassed while ordering, feeling the need to throw in a \"for a friend\" as she ordered four large sausage and bacon biscuits and a large order of tater tots.  Her stomach gurgled with anticipation while the food was handed to her by a cashier who couldn't care less.  <i>Oh, shut up, I'm getting food, okay?</i> Lindsay thought, frustrated.  Before she just felt off, now she was actively annoyed at nothing in particularly.  She tore open the first biscuit and was cramming it in her mouth before she even left the parking lot.  Her stomach gurgled a thank you, but Lindsay had to consciously fight down a sickening feeling at all the grease she was putting into her already grease-filled stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay had made the drive a million times and so was quite comfortable eating on the road.  What wasn't comfortable was how her stomach kept groaning at her while she eat, no matter how stuffed it was getting.  Lindsay's mind sent her mixed signals.  She should be nauseous from all of this greasy, fattening food that was sitting in her stomach like a heavy lump, but she was also starving and needed to eat.  She thought about the xPect from the night before.  If all this energy drink did was make you sick and hungry it was never going to sell in the American market.  Or any market, really, now that she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell for the first class had already rung when Lindsay pulled up.  She could have gotten in just as the students were sitting down, but sat in her car finishing her meal first.  By the time she got to the last tater tot she practically had to force it down, but force it down she did.  She leaned back, rubbing her stuffed belly in her hands.  It felt hard as a rock, but at least it distracted her from the full, hypersensitive feeling in her breasts.  She thought her belt and skirt were chafing her up front.  As if she wasn't self conscious about her swollen chest, now she'd be worried that she looked bloated, too.  With a fleeting sense of foreboding, Lindsay realized she was wearing the same outfit as in her dream last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her tummy unconsciously, Lindsay made her way down the empty halls.  A few stragglers were rushing to class.  These were young kids here, and generally weren't intentionally missing class.  Lindsay stifled a belch as she entered her class.  She buttoned up her sweater to further hide her body, an action which seemed laughable yet disturbing to the knowingly beautiful teacher.  She braced herself for what was certainly going to be a frustrating, long day.</span></div></div>",

She was constantly tugging at her belt, adjusting her shirt when she turned to the chalk board, and enduring the loud moans coming from her stomach.  She wished she had worn a skirt that sat lower one her hips, as she could swear her waistband was getting tighter around her middle the longer the day went on.  And that's not even mentioning how hypersensitive her breasts were, a sensation made more distracting by her mysteriously tighter bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as she might Lindsay couldn't help but snapping at a few students who were being rowdy.  She felt bad immediately, and softened her voice even more than usual afterwards.  But soon something else would suddenly cause her to flare up and suppress a growl.  Of course the kids didn't mean any harm.  She had some of the best-behaved students in the school and they treated her with as much respect as kids that age.  She knew there was no reason for her to be frustrated with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody has bad days, she told herself as she took a break, sitting at her desk while the students worked quietly at their desks.  She rubbed her throbbing temples and leaned forward with her elbows on her desk.  Her skirt and belt cut into her stomach.  She let out a little burp and gave her tummy a sympathetic rub.  She knew it was just her imagination, but she thought her blouse's buttons felt strained.  She couldn't exactly lift up her sweater to check in class, though, and contented herself that she really was just that uncomfortably bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's no wonder with how you've been pigging out lately,</i> she told herself, even though she knew that it had only been today that her appetite had been out of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time lunch rolled around, Lindsay was starving.  She couldn't get out of the classroom fast enough.  How could she be so hungry but still feel so full?  With her hand firmly planted over her growling stomach Lindsay went to the teacher's lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was thankfully mostly empty when she got there.  She filled up a tray with much, much more food than she intended.  Sitting down, she audibly moaned at the amount of food she was about to eat.  She patted her stomach again.  There was no mistaken the food baby underneath her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just one of those days,</i> she thought, rationalizing her ravenous hunger, <i>I'll be better tomorrow.</i>  With that, Lindsay dug in, her normally dainty eating habits thrown to the wind as she somehow managed to create a steady flow of food into her mouth with little interruption.  Her stomach made a strange, growling sound, as if both objecting to being stuffed beyond capacity but also pleased at being obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay barely even noticed when Amy entered.  One minute, Lindsay's eyes were squarely on her overfilled tray watching the food disappear into her equally overfilled stomach, the next she looked up at the large, round belly that belonged to her best friend and co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lindsay,\" Amy said in her sing songy tone while taking a seat.  Amy was nearing the end of her pregnancy, and the effects, Lindsay thought, were astonishing.  Amy had never been really thin, although nobody would call her particularly heavy.  But that had changed now.  With another month to go Lindsay couldn't imagine how Amy could get much bigger.  It wasn't just her belly.  Her whole body had swelled.  Lindsay tried not to think like this about her friend, but in the mood she was in she couldn't help but be judgmental, if silently.  <i>Oh God, she used to actually be pretty,</i> Lindsay thought, <i>Well, at least cute.  Now she's so swollen, and puffy, uhg . . . </i>  Lindsay shook her head, swallowing the huge mouthful of food.  She hadn't said anything, of course, but felt bad all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there.  How's things going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave her a look as she lowered herself into her seat.  She too had a tray of food, and it wasn't nearly as full as Lindsay's still was.  As Amy spoke, Lindsay began stuffing a muffin-her third-into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, good.  The doctor says I'm healthy, the baby's healthy, we're all healthy here.  How are you?  Carl's coming back today, right?  Do you miss him about the same when he leaves or are you kind of used to it by now?\" Amy continued along this vein until Lindsay, having wolfed down some unappetizing but, to her suddenly no longer discerning palate perfectly delicious, mozzarella sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually he came home last night to surprise me.  It was nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?  Something seems not right,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Lindsay said, stifling a belch, \"I think I contracted a stomach thing last night.  Carl brought back this new energy drink.  I was throwing up all night and,\" she hesitated, blushing despite herself, \"and, ah, eating nonstop since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah,\" Amy said, nodding, but giving no indication she had any idea about what was wrong with Lindsay.  Lindsay found that inexplicably annoying and now regretted telling her friend that she had been eating a lot.  She self-consciously planted her hands across her tummy, which at least stopped her from eating for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you say everything's going well?\" Lindsay nodded to Amy's own giant ball of a belly, but Amy looked like she still wanted to discuss what Lindsay was clearly so on edge about.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay stuffed more food in her mouth to give her time to answer.  She really didn't want to be social right now.  She was starving and bloated and irritable.  The only thing she wanted to do was go home and sleep.  Fortunately, Principal Maria Donner appeared as if from nowhere.  As usual, she approached with a purpose which she immediately began speaking of, heedless of any discussion Lindsay and Amy might have been having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Lindsay.  Amy.  I wanted to speak with you about the tricounty spelling bee.  I'd like to get to the state championship this year.  It'll be good for the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay, chewed and swallowed her mouthful of food before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" she asked, sounding less friendly than she intended.  Maria addressed her, barely acknowledging Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like a list of students you think would have the best shot in the lower grades.  Do any names come to mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, not off the top of my head . . . well . . .\" Lindsay thought.  She actually could name a few students she knew to be exceptional spellers.  She just didn't care to discuss it in length at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, take your time,\" Maria said, her tone more positive upon seeing Lindsay actually considering the topic.  \"Have a list to me by the end of the week, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll get it to you,\" Lindsay said, taking a giant bite of her sandwich, then finishing it off as Maria walked away straight to another table.  Lindsay found herself watching her go.  Maria was much taller than her, but otherwise she knew from older faculty photos that in her younger days she had a similar figure.  Now she was in her fifties, and while still a beautiful woman had steadily gained weight.  She was now, Lindsay thought as she watched her, a voluptuous older woman with hips a little too wide and nagging bit of a belly which Lindsay could imagine her struggling to keep under control.  Her own stomach rumbled.  She rubbed it, sitting back.  It was tight and firm in her hand.  She adjusted her belt, letting it out a notch, then blushed when she looked back at Amy, glad she hadn't seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I don't know any spellers?\" Amy said, not nearly as annoyed as her words would indicate.  She turned back to Lindsay.  \"So what's up?  Talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, okay?  I promise,\" Lindsay stood up to go, taking now completely empty tray with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Amy said, her expression showing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay belched quietly and groaned in frustration as she found herself rubbing her swollen tummy as she left.  Amy nodded to herself.  She was certain her friend had some big news she was in denial about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter politely asking half the teachers she met who were not in class for good spellers, and advice on improving their odds, Maria bolted to the back of the building as kitchen supplies were being delivered.  The vice principal normally handled this, but he was on vacation, and Maria never missed a chance to micromanage.  She moved surprisingly fast, oftentimes vanishing before whoever she was talking to could even say good bye.  She wasn't an intentionally callous person, but while at work every single about the school was her priority, and she fluctuated wildly between which was the top priority at any given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery was going smoothly, but Maria just wanted to check.  She found one of the new teachers on break out back.  She didn't mind if the faculty wanted some alone time.  Who could blame them?  Pamela Kim was otherwise very friendly, if reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery driver pushed one last crate out of the loading dock and into the building.  It had a large, generic logo on it, so Maria assumed it must be for the vending machines.  Pamela moved to walk inside, apparently not noticing Maria there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New energy drink?\" said the young teacher, stopping at the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the driver said, \"Just in from, aah, who cares?  Yeah, they're new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela grabbed on for herself, putting it in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it a try,\" she said more to herself, and then continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria almost ran after her to tell her not to do that, but thought better of it.  She had learned to not press teachers too hard on the little things, such as taking food from the cafeteria and such.  It made it easier to get them to see eye to eye on bigger issues when they came up.  Still, she was curious now.  She took a can of the drink herself, the label reading XPect in big, generic letters.  She was sure Gary had ordered these, always trying to give the students something new to keep them interested.  She would have to test it, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay only felt worse the rest of the day.  It was all she could do to put on a cheerful face for her students.  It wasn't just that she felt full, although she did considering how much she had eaten, her stomach felt heavier, harder.  Lindsay had never been one to wear tight clothing, and being naturally thin she didn't have, so the feeling of her belt growing tighter around her waist, and of the buttons on her blouse beginning to strain, was both uncomfortable and alien to her.  She pointedly refused to look down at her swollen breasts and stomach.  She was certain they must look bigger even to somebody not paying attention now.  Finally, by three, the students quietly in their seats, Lindsay sat down at her desk and rested her head in her hands with a loud sigh.  She looked forward and felt a sudden release along her middle.  At least one of her buttons had popped off under her sweater, making a sound she convinced the whole class could hear.  Nobody noticed, though, and Lindsay couldn't help but slouch down in her chair and examine her tummy.  It had grown rounder in the last few hours, looking positively puffy now.  Her belt and skirt were digging into her, not to mention even with the release of one button her shirt was still feeling tight, especially around her breasts.  She fidgeted in her seat, releasing a slight moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay couldn't wait for class to let out.  She was polite, but now growing too tired to put in much effort.  When the students left, she closed her door, and gave her body a good look.  She rubbed her stomach, glad she had worn a sweater, except now even that looked tight and failed to hide that her middle was rounder, fuller.  She undid her belt another two notches, finding that now the only way to get her skirt to feel better would be to unbutton it.  She was sure her breasts would be the next thing to bust a button.  She really liked this blouse, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing the floor of her empty classroom, Lindsay placed one hand on her hip and the other on her firm, rounded tummy.  She bit her lip, a wave of frustration settling over her.  <i>I guess I really am gaining weight,</i> she thought, and the idea really did upset her.  She liked the way she always looked.  She hated the thought of having to buy bigger clothes, even if \"bigger\" would be average to most women.  And look how much she had gained already?  What if Carl came on after one of his longer trips and found his petite, beautiful wife had become stout, round, even fat, in his absence?  He wouldn't say anything, of course, and she didn't feel any kind of obligation to stay thin just to make her husband happy, but she could imagine the disappointment in his face as he hugged her and found her big gut pressing against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay shook her head.  She was overthinking this.  For all she knew she was just really bloated, maybe having an unusual reaction to something.  People's stomachs don't usually expand enough in a day to outgrow clothes, as she seemed to be on the fast track to doing.  Sure, that must be it, it was probably just an allergic reaction.  She convinced herself enough of this possibility that she decide she would think no more of this, since hopefully by tomorrow the swelling would go down.  It also explained her headache and bad moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading home, Lindsay finished up some work, and, at the demand of her annoyingly rumbling stomach, picked up a big load of fast food on the way.  Again, she couldn't even wait to get out of the parking lot before she tore the bag open and started eating.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay was pleased to find that before going home where she would undoubtedly continue to be restrained and frustrated, she was able to call Amy.  Amy was more than happy to hang out with Lindsay for a few hours.  The two hadn't really done that in a few weeks, and Amy had plenty to say.  Lindsay let her speak, politely dismissing hints from Amy to let out whatever was bothering.  The problem was that now that Lindsay had a person to vent to, she wasn't sure what she was venting about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy tried on a few of her late term pregnancy dresses and asked Lindsay's opinion.  Lindsay didn't come out and say what she thought-that Amy looked enormous in anything-but was polite.  In fact, while Lindsay couldn't suppress her thoughts that Amy's looks had suffered from her rather large pregnancy, she thought she had been harder on her before.  She even started to see what people said when they spoke of that \"glow\" pregnant women had.  Amy was never that gorgeous to begin with, but while hugely pregnant, Lindsay had to admit she did look kind of cute.  Pretty, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you tell me what's wrong now?\" Amy finally said, plopping herself down next to Lindsay.  Lindsay had been fidgeting in her seat the whole time.  She had removed her belt in the car, but that didn't relieve the pressure her skirt was giving her.  The zipper strained as her lower belly felt fuller and rounder than before.  Her sweater still covered without hiding her bloated middle, and the missing button weighed heavily on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Lindsay said with a sigh.  \"It's just been a very, very aggravating day.  I don't know when it started . . . well, yes I do.  Last night, I had a new energy drink Carl brought back.  I was throwing up half the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg, I know how that can be,\" Amy said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've been pigging out all day.  Look at this,\" she lifted her sweater, revealing the missing button on her blouse.  \"I actually popped a button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Amy said, patting Lindsay's shoulder.  She wasn't the type to throw back the fact that she, much more than Amy, must have infinitely more complaints about her changing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm overreacting,\" Lindsay pulled her sweater back down, and when she went to slouch in her seat wound up jutting her chest forward.  A snap was heard from under her sweater.  Lindsay blushed, folding her arms around her as she settled into a pouty slouch.  \"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably just bloating from that drink.  Unless . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.  But still, everything feels off today.  These and this are just the worst part,\" Lindsay motioned to her whole front.  She didn't look that different, especially with the dark sweater minimizing her growth, but Amy now had a good view of just how bloated Linday's tummy was getting, and her breasts had gone from their usual firm and tiny size to looking just under ungainly on her slim frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should see a doctor.  You know, when I was pregnant the first time-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not pregnant,\" Lindsay said quickly, although the way she rubbed her stomach was too reminiscent of how Amy rubbed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know.  Lindsay, just see a doctor, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw a whole lot of doctors before and I can assure you I'm not pregnant.  But . . . I'll think about it.  If this swelling doesn't go down by tomorrow we'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, her eyes fixed on Lindsay's stomach.  Her friend did not look like herself.  She was irritable and had a tired expression on her face.  Only when Lindsay brushed her red hair out of her face with a flourish and smiled did Amy think Lindsay might be getting into her usual, better mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better get home,\" Lindsay said, smiling.  She did feel better, even if her clothes felt even tighter than before somehow.  \"Carl's making dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I miss Carl dinners,\" Amy said.  She hadn't been over to their place in a while, as Carl had been spending more time abroad for business since Amy had gotten pregnant.  \"Not that I'm missing out on eating,\" she laughed and patted her stomach.  Lindsay almost glared at her, but just smiled back and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at work tomorrow,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.  Take care,\" Lindsay said, and was glad to pull away.  Her full stomach pressed up against Amy's huge belly was an unnerving feeling for reasons she couldn't entirely explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better than she had all day, although still uncomfortable and not too happy, Lindsay made her way home, confident that a relaxing night with food and her husband would make everything better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl knew right off that Lindsay had had a frustrating day.  Lindsay didn't want to discuss it, though, and Carl accepted that.  When Lindsay was in a sour mood the only thing to do was wait and let her either come out of it or let her talk about it if she wanted to.  Tonight, she didn't.  After briefly hugging her husband, worried that he'd notice her swollen tummy if she stayed still too long, she immediately went upstairs to change.  She felt instant relief upon removing her skirt followed by a sinking feeling when she saw the lines around her sides caused by it cutting into her.  She moaned loudly as she surveyed the missing buttons on her blouse while her hand subconsciously rubbed her slightly curved stomach.  She threw on some sweatpants and a tank top long enough to only reveal the smallest amount of her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl hadn't noticed that Lindsay was bloated, but he did detect that something was different.  When she sulked downstairs in her more comfortable attire he kept staring at her to see what it was.  He was just getting off the phone when she came down and fell back on the couch with a muffled sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise,\" Carl said, \"I thought tonight was a pizza night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay smiled, her eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" she said, feeling less stressed already.  As generally healthy eaters pizza was a rarity reserved when either one of them was feeling down.  Lindsay stomach groaned, vibrating visibly with hunger.  Lindsay blushed and quickly yanked a blanket over her hoping Carl didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl picked out a few movies that would be sure to relax his wife and, by proxy, himself.  By the time the pizza arrived Lindsay was in better spirits.  She made some references to being annoyed with the principal at work but that was the detail she went into.  Around this time Carl thought he realized what was different.  Unless he was mistaken Lindsay's always smallish breasts looked a little fuller.  This wasn't an unwelcome change, if it wasn't just an illusion, and Carl thought there was something else he was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Lindsay's best efforts, it soon became obvious.  While Carl had a first and second piece, Lindsay had already eaten three, and was going for a fourth.  He stomach groaned under the blanket and Lindsay, who wasn't used to this unprecedented onslaught of hunger, was powerless to resist.  The quiet hours wore on punctuated by Lindsay's chewing, occasional belches, and the churning sound coming from her belly that grew quieter the fuller she got.  Lindsay went into a state of zen eating, aware of how uncomfortably full and heavy her stomach was getting but forcing the thoughts back.  She could feel the skin around her slim tummy grow tight, almost painfully so, while safely hidden by the blanket her shirt rode up and her sweatpants rode down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay barely noticed the time passing.  It was nearly 12:00 when some awareness returned to her.  She was leaning into Carl's arm, and he in turn into the side of the couch, half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ready for bed, honey?\" he nudged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so,\" Lindsay stretched her arms, then stopped with a pained moan as the movement sent a stinging feeling through her taut, bulging belly.  The blanket slid to the floor and Lindsay, her eyes half closed, let her hands fall to her middle and gently cup her exposed, hugely bloated stomach in her hands.  She sighed softly, turning her head.  She awoke with a start when she saw the confused look on Carl's face.  She turned bright red, and quickly yanked her tank top down over her stomach.  She stood up quickly, stumbling a little as if the two entire pizzas inside her were no throwing off her center of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>{Two pizzas?)</i> she thought with dismay looking at the empty boxes while still holding her shirt down.  She saw that it stuck out further than before, giving her breasts a run for their money.  Carl must have noticed the look on her face, as he put a sympathetic hand on her shoulder.  Before he could answer, she brushed him off and quickly stalked off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's-it's just a food baby,\" she said, mortified at letting Carl see her pig out like that, \"It's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl thought that anything said after that would only make things worse.  He followed her up to bed to find her already hiding under the covers.  He said good night and kissed her on the cheek.  She grunted, too embarrassed to say anything further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay fell asleep surprisingly fast, but woke up slowly and achingly.  She did her best, as usual, to not wake Carl.  She had almost forgotten the pizza binge from the night before, although the still full feeling in her stomach reminded her.  She moved sluggishly, feeling weighed down.  She tugged on her sweatpants.  The felt snug, not just around her front which she knew was puffy, but around her behind, too.  As she moved past the bathroom mirror she experienced a similar, but stronger, sense of dread as the morning before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped at her profile.  Her tiny ass had gained some inches, stretching her sweatpants.  Except if it had the effect was being accentuated by the new, subtle curve her back was making around the middle as her fully round stomach jutted forward, as far out as her round, swollen breasts.  Her tank top looked almost too small on her.  She stared slack jawed at her altered figure, her hands moving along her rounded backside and her horribly swollen stomach.  Her mind raced to explain it, the only explanation being a forceful restating of her belief from the previous day.  Even though her arms were still slender, and her face still beautiful and thin, Lindsay spoke softly to herself with a tremor in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm fat,\" she said, the words causing her the nearly tear up.  How could she have let this happen?  She was always so healthy and had the body to show it.  What happened that made her so lazy and bloated?  Had Carl noticed the whole time but been too polite to say anything?  She would have thought at least Amy would have warned her, rather than hint through insinuations she must be pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, nearly all of her clothes could not fit Lindsay's new figure, particularly her belly.  Her breasts and ass posed their own problems, but it was clear that her belly was the real trouble area.  Lindsay did what she could, finding a tasteful skirt with a stretchy waistband and a loose-fitting blouse that, if it didn't hide the fact that she was gaining a lot of weight, at least wouldn't rip open if she stuffed herself senseless again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay only considered staying home sick once, and then scrapped the idea.  As much as she dreaded having all her co-workers see her like this she dreaded seeing Carl all the more.  He must have noticed, she thought, and was ashamed at him being there when she realized what she had let happen to herself.  With an unsettling extra swaying in her hips Lindsay made her way to school.</span></div></div>",

She still felt odd, so she decided to head to the bathroom to wash her face.  She approached the sink and filled her hands with water, then applied the water to her face.  As she did this, Lindsay could hear someone gagging in a nearby stall.  A flush was heard, and Principal Donner exited from the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Lindsay.\" she said, her face pale and her voice hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.  You alright, Maria?\" Lindsay asked, drying off her hands and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I think I've got food poisoning.  I've been throwing up since yesterday afternoon.\" Maria replied, one hand resting on her stomach and the other on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not good.  Any idea what caused it?\" Lindsay asked, her own hand subconsciously going to her rounding middle.  She frowned, and removed it forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could remember.  I've...been eating more than usual since yesterday.\" she said, as if it pained her to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you feel better!  You know, I had something similar the past few days, but it's cleared up for the most part.\" Lindsay said, giving the principal a smile.  Her stomach rumbled, breaking the fairly peaceful moment.  \"Well, the hunger's still there...\" she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice talking to you, Lindsay.  Oh, don't forget about the Parent Teacher conferences tomorrow night!\" she said, exiting the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember!\" Lindsay replied.  As the principal exited the restroom, Amy entered, her belly leading the way.  Lindsay was surprised that she wasn't wearing any of the maternity dresses that she had gotten yesterday, and instead was wearing a blouse that was a little too small, as a sliver of her belly was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Lindsay.  You feeling better?\" she asked, her tummy bumping into Lindsay as she approached her.  \"Sorry.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not throwing up anymore, so that's good.  But...something still feels off.\" Lindsay said.  She noticed the look on Amy's face, and changed the subject.  \"So, uh, why aren't you wearing one of your new maternity dresses?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's laundry day.  And you know how I like to have my clothes washed before I wear them for the first time.  You never know who's tried on clothes before you.\" she said, pulling up her shirt to rub her pregnant belly.  It had a few stretched marks, and looked incredibly tight, almost uncomfortably so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, no offense, Amy, but you're huge!  Are you sure there's just one in there?\" Lindsay asked, rubbing her friend's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned, upset that Lindsay had pointed her size out to her.  If there's anything a pregnant woman hates, it's someone telling them how big they've gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I'm sure.  You're welcome to come along to my ultrasound appointment after school today if you want to see for yourself.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Owen doesn't want to come along?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between all of my pregnancies, he's been to enough.  So do you want to?  You'd have to drive, though.  It's...kind of getting hard.\" Amy admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Lindsay smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!  Listen, I'll talk to you at lunch, okay?  This baby's been kicking my bladder for the past thirty minutes.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay walked into the teacher's lounge, and noticed that it was much quieter than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's Pamela?\" she asked, noticing that Ms. Kim was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She took the day off.  She said she was throwing up all night.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big deal.  I have too but you don't see me complaining about it.\" Gary Bundy said, a fifth grade teacher.  He was a somehow married man in his late thirties with a rapidly receding hairline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not everyone has as strong of a desire to educate as you do, Mr. Bundy.\" Maria said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way.  You wanna try this energy drink, Lindsay?  It's the last one.  You've looked like hell the past few days, so I though you could use it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, Gary.  I've tried it already.  It's...not really my thing.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\" he said, chucking the drink in the trash can nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and the teachers left the lounge, ready to face the day ahead.  Lindsay was the last one out and made her way to her classroom, her stomach giving a faint rumble that she knew would grow louder and more frequent as the day grew on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be a long day...\" Lindsay sighed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay found this day more frustrating than the last.  She found herself sitting down a lot more, not nearly as active as she usually was when tending to her students.  Inwardly she told herself this was a mistake.  With how big she was getting she should not give into the temptation to sit still.  But when she was sitting still, during the few moments when her students worked quietly, she would slouch back in her chair, gently rubbing her oddly firm, rounded stomach under her clothes.  She found it difficult to grasp that it, and the enlarged breasts above it, really belonged to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also constantly growled at her.  She kept running to the snack machines when she could to quickly stuff her face with something, anything, but it was never enough.  She kicked herself even more for this.  <i>Damn it, Lindsay, you're fat enough.  Why can't I control myself anymore?</i> This only made her more irritable.  She also found herself rushing to the bathroom more than usual, like her stuffed belly was fighting for room with her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of the day things were getting out of hand.  Lindsay's head was pounding, her stomach screaming, her loose-fitting skirt and shirt felt alarmingly snug.  Could she have grown so much throughout the day eating only the occasional snack?  It seemed impossible, but her body confirmed it.  <i>Impossible,</i> she thought, grimacing at herself in the teacher's lounge bathroom as the day drew to an end.  Her fat stomach did, she admitted, look a little pregnant.  She had thought before that her ass was growing along with her stomach and breasts, but looking at herself now she thought it was her posture.  She was slouching, like her center of gravity was shifting, and her slim behind looked like it was jutting out backwards as her belly did forward.  Her arms and legs were still thin.  Her face, thank god, didn't look any chubbier.  Lindsay could only stand to look at herself and contemplate her changing body for so long.  She had to turn away, and just missed Principal Donner rushing in to one of the stalls again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay met up with Amy with the hopes that her mood would lighten.  To a degree, it did.  Even already have several kids she still was happy for her friend that her and Mike had another on the way.  It also confirmed that there was, in fact, only one in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Amy aid smirking as she pulled her shirt back down.  Lindsay helped her up.  The doctor kept looking at Lindsay as if she wanted to ask her something.  Finally, as they were about to clear out, she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask who you're seeing?\" she said, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what now?\" Lindsay said, her hand moving, as it did too often now, to her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Ob/gyn,\" she said, \"I don't mean to pry, I was just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color rushed into Lindsay's face as she suppressed an angry shout.  Amy must have seen the signs, as she immediately said goodbye and began rushing Lindsay out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>not</i> pregnant,\" Lindsay hissed as they left the building, wanting to say something nasty about the doctor but not willing to give it more effort than unintelligible mutterings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, you know ho these doctors are, they think everyone's pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay rubbed her stomach in frustration, feeling much more angry and, to her own surprise, on the verge of tears.  She was never this emotional, certainly about some perceived slight.  It must be because she was still getting used to the idea that she had gained weight, she reasoned, calming herself down.  The realization was so sudden that of course she'd feel off kilter, especially how all around awful she had been feeling the last few days.  Ever since she had that XPect . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just not used to to . . . to this,\" Lindsay said, sniffling a little as she placed her hands on her swollen middle.  She was embarrassed both for how she felt now and for nearly lashing out at Amy's doctor.  \"I'm sorry, Amy.  I've been so off lately.  I was sick after that drink the other night and ever since then, with work and how much I've been eating . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy patted Lindsay on the back.  \"It's okay, I know it's rough.  Want to go back to my place?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I...I don't think so, Amy.  Sorry, but I'm just not feeling well.  I'll see you tomorrow.\" Lindsay said.  Amy nodded.  \"Okay.  Hope you feel better.\" Amy said, going in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay hesitated, then begrudgingly hugged her friend.  Their stomachs collided, preventing them from fully embracing.  Amy looked down at Lindsay's belly, and nearly gasped as she saw how big it had gotten since yesterday.  She frowned, but decided that it was best to not bring it up due to Lindsay's current mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bid farewell, and went their separate ways.  Lindsay returned home, anxious to see how Carl would react to her growth.  She pulled into the driveway and headed inside slowly, partly out of choice, and partly because of how weighed down she felt.  No matter, she entered the house and was greeted by Carl, who was sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe.\" he said, his eyes not straying from the TV.  \"Hey.  Gonna get changed real quick.\" Lindsay said, quickly going up the stairs.  She shimmied out of her skirt and walked up to the mirror so it would be easier for her to see the buttons on her blouse.  What she saw shocked her.  Her blouse, fairly loose at the beginning of the day, was now tight, straining the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay unbuttoned the blouse as fast as she could, fearing that if she grew any more the buttons would burst.  She looked at her bare belly in the mirror, turning to see how much it had grown.  Not only had it continued to push out, but Lindsay could swear that it was beginning to become rounder.  If she didn't know any better, she'd say she looked like Amy did when she was nearly six months pregnant.  Lindsay shuddered at that thought, desperately trying to find something that would cover up her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on a pair of sweatpants, which hugged the curves of her rear a bit more than she would have liked, and put on one of Carl's t-shirts.  Normally it would be incredibly loose on her, but now it was pushed out by her round stomach.  Shaking her head, Lindsay returned to the living room to properly greet Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day?\" he asked as she sat down on the couch next to him, crossing her arms over her belly.  \"Not great.  Still feeling kinda weird.  But it's the same old same old.  Oh, I did go with Amy to her ultrasound appointment today.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  How was that?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow.  \"It was...interesting, I guess.  You won't believe how big she's gotten, though.  God, it's like she's smuggling a beach ball in her womb.\" she scoffed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, damn.  I hope you aren't saying those kinds of things to her face.  So...you've kinda been doing a bunch of pregnancy related stuff with Amy lately, haven't you?  What's up with that?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I guess she needs some help with things since she's sort of getting close to her due date now.\" Lindsay said.  \"I guess so.  Anyway, I was going to make dinner soon.  I was planning on making pasta...\" Carl said, trailing off to give Lindsay input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I was kind of wanting steak...\" Lindsay said.  \"Steak?  I thought you didn't like steak.  When we went to that steakhouse for our first date you got a burger.\" Carl pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.  I...guess I'm craving it.\" she said, giving him a weak smile.  \"Fine.  I'll be right back.\" he said, pulling out his phone to call the aforementioned steakhouse as he left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was left alone with a growling and growing stomach, a deadly combination.  Trying to fend off her hunger, she went and got her laptop,  looking up her curious symptoms.  Normally, she would rest the laptop in her lap, but now she had to rest it on her legs as her belly impeded her lap.  As she surfed the web, she subconsciously rubbed the bottom of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe typed in her symptoms: growing stomach and breasts, constant hunger, nausea, and hit enter.  There was one solution to her search: pregnancy.  \"It's not possible...\" she said.  She removed some of the symptoms, and just left in \"growing stomach\" and \"constant hunger\".  There were a few more results, including weight gain, a tapeworm, or a hysterical pregnancy.  \"Maybe...\" Lindsay trailed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that a web source couldn't diagnose her problems, she closed her laptop and turned the TV on.  She was distracted for a while, but as her stomach rumbled more loudly and frequently, she couldn't ignore it anymore.  Lindsay walked to the kitchen, looking for anything to quench her appetite. By now, it was nearly 8:30, and she couldn't wait any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a bag of potato chips and began to eat them.  However, this wasn't quite what she was looking for.  Lindsay returned to the cabinet and pulled out some nutella, which she began to dip the chips in.  In no time, she went through half the bag.  She was interrupted by Carl returning.  \"Sorry about the wait!  The place was packed.  Oh, and I saw the principal there!  She said hell-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the kitchen and stopped when saw his wife.  \"Couldn't wait, huh?\" he laughed.  \"Sorry...I got hungry.\" Lindsay said.  \"It's fine!  As long as you eat your meal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't be a problem.  Lindsay ate her steak in record time, and continued her conquest on her baked potato.  Carl just stared in awe.  Lindsay noticed after she finished her meal.  \"So...babe.\" she said.  \"Yeah?\" he asked.  \"Do you...think I could have the rest of your steak?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl looked down at this plate, and he had only eaten half of the steak.  \"Sure.  I still have the baked potato to eat.  He passed it over to his wife, and she began to chow down.  Lindsay finished the rest of the steak before Carl was done.  She stifled a burp, and looked down at her stomach.  Lindsay could have sworn that it grew again, which greatly upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I need to go to the restroom.\" she said, hurrying to the bathroom upstairs.  She locked the door behind her and pulled up her shirt, getting a good luck at her growing belly.  Indeed, it had grown again, and she looked well over six months pregnant.  At this sight, she began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl heard her, and approached the bathroom door, trying to open the door before realizing that it was locked.  He knocked on the door.  \"Linds...\" he said.  <br>\r\n\"What?\" Lindsay asked.  \"Let me in.  I want to talk to you.\" he said.  He heard a few sniffles before the door unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he saw his wife, or to be more precise, her belly.  \"So...what's wrong?\" he asked.  \"What's wrong?  Do you see me?  Do you see THIS?\" she asked, pointing to her bared belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you've just put on some weight.  That's all.  I mean, you're close to 40.  You couldn't have stayed young and slim forever.  Neither of us could.\" Carl said, putting his hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay shook her head.  \"So I'm fat?  Thanks, you ass!  And I would think that a fat stomach would be flabby and soft.  Not...like this.\" she said.  \"I'm sorry.  I just...think that's what's happen-\" \"Feel it.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Carl asked.  \"Feel my stomach.\" she repeated.  \"I...okay.\" he said.  He put his hand on Lindsay's belly, noticing how hard it was.  \"So what?  You had like two steaks, a baked potato, and half a bag of chips.  You're just bloated.  What, do you think you're pregnant or something?  We tried for years.  We know it can't happen.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I know.  It's just...I guess I am putting on weight.\" Lindsay sighed.  \"Hey, how about we start working out together?  We can start tonight!\" Carl offered.  \"Not tonight.  I'm really tired.\" she said.  \"Tomorrow?\" Carl asked.  \"Well, I have the parent-teacher conferences.  Maybe if I'm still up for it after we can do it.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  That belly will go away in no time!\" he said, patting Lindsay's stomach.  She couldn't help but smile.  \"Good night.\" she said, playfully smacking him with one hand and pulling her shirt down with the other.  \"Night.  I have to take a business call, so I'll get to bed when I'm done.\" Carl said.  Lindsay nodded and headed to bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay slipped under the covers and tried to sleep, but she was surprisingly hot.  She tore off the covers, which made her a little more comfortable.  Lindsay shifted to her side, as the weight of her belly was beginning to get uncomfortable.  Finally in a position to sleep, she shut her eyes, but opened her eyes when she began to feel an odd sensation in her stomach, a gassy, almost wiggling feeling.  \"I guess that's what happens when I eat so much this late.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay rubbed her round belly, hoping that this would quell the feeling.  It did, but without thought she still rubbed her stomach as she drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Surprisingly, Lindsay fell asleep easily once she was able to turn to her side and let her stuffed belly rest, but it was a fitful sleep.  She dreamed of being compelled to eat nonstop, of busting buttons and tearing clothes, of her slim coworkers snickering about her weight behind her back.  When the alarm finally woke her, Lindsay awoke in no better mood.  Slowly, with more effort than she was used to, she rose from her bed and wandered to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My new morning ritual,</i> she thought as she turned to the mirror with her hands cradling her belly.  It hard grown since last night, no doubt about it.  She still felt full from her meal, which explained why it still felt full and tight, and not flabby as she knew it normally must be now.  Her breasts might be larger, they certainly felt heavier, almost full as her stomach.  With a grimace she realized that her belly now outgrew her breasts by  a good margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be comfortable, so despite believing that it would be another blow to her self esteem she decided on jeans for the day.  Happily, they fit, but buttoning them was uncomfortable.  Her belly sat heavily upon the button, even if she was pleased that she could still fit her good jeans over her hips and ass.  She struggled with her bra, then threw on a stylish, clingy shirt.  It was outfit she always liked.  She thought she looked particularly sexy in it.  Not today, though.  The front was stretched to its limit, barely covering her belly, and the seams at the side felt like they could bust open at any moment.  For her own security she threw a cardigan on over it, but knew she would be unable to button it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was walking slower now, she knew, but today she thought her belly was actually pulling her forward.  Her back ached, and a few times she caught herself rubbing her curved back as she walked like she really was pregnant.  She pushed the thought out of her mind, but didn't even bother trying to stop her hands from rubbing her back, or even her taut, round stomach.  She felt an occasional bubble of gas inside her, but no burps came to relieve her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay arrived in the teachers' lounge before anyone that morning.  That worked out, as she was able to grab more snacks than she thought she'd be able to eat before anybody saw her.  When Amy came waddling in, she was already seated and surrounded by wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look awful,\" Amy said sympathetically, putting a hand on her arm as she sat across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  I'm a whale.  I feel like I can barely walk,\" Lindsay spoke calmly, if sadly, and Amy could tell she was somewhat resigned if only temporarily.  \"Carl and I are going to start working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good . . . \" Amy peered around the table with narrowed eyes, which widened as she saw Lindsay's belly packed into her too tight shirt.  \"Oh my god, Lindsay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay glared at her, \"Don't even say it.  I know what I look like, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther teachers had started to arrive by now.  They were quieter than usual, some seemed to be in a particularly sour mood.  Maria sidled up to Lindsay and Amy.  Lindsay thought she looked just as tired and stressed as her.  But there was something else.  The curvy but slim older woman had, like Lindsay, put on some weight.  Lindsay might otherwise not have noticed, even if it was pretty obvious.  She felt some sadistic pleasure in knowing she wasn't the only one whose youthful metabolism was failing her, even if Principal Donner had a good twenty years on her.  Her slacks and buttoned dress shirt were stretched tautly across her round stomach, which she kept rubbing as if afraid it would get bigger if she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay.  Amy,\" she said, \"Have you give any thought to the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we know, the spelling bee,\" Gary, sitting a table behind them, suddenly snapped, \"We know all about the spelling bee, we're not going to just conjure better spelling students out of thin air if you keep nagging us about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, looking eager to have some to lash out at, turned to Gary and spoke in her most authoritative voice, \"This is important for the image and welfare of the school, Gary.  I thought you'd be a little more concerned given how your students' test scores have been lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary rolled his eyes and stood up to continue the argument, \"Don't start telling me about test scores . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" Amy said.  Lindsay wolfed down her last candy bar and followed Amy.  As she did so, she got a clear view of Amy's colossal ass and hips, and noticed the swaying movement they made as she walked.  She inwardly moaned.  Amy was waddling, and Lindsay could recognize that own unfamiliar sway of her hips as the start of the same walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the teachers lounge listening to other teachers get into the argument, both for and against the principal.  As they did so, Lindsay nearly ran into Pamela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back,\" Lindsay said in an offhand manner, \"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Pamela said quietly.  The slight young woman was hunched over, her arms folded across her, Lindsay noticed, swollen chest.  The baggy sweater she wore couldn't hide that her stomach was pooching out some, too.  Lindsay almost said something, almost even made a mental connection, but Pamela kept walking, her eyes on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pamela's put on some weight, it looks like,\" Amy said, then turned to Lindsay with a start, changing the subject, \"So see you at lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Lindsay said.  The two parted ways to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, class was more frustrating than the day before.  Tests were being given today, which meant Lindsay had to walk up and down the aisles as her students worked, to help and to prevent cheating.  They were generally good kids, but it still happened.  Walking down the aisles proved embarrassingly difficult for Lindsay.  Throughout her whole teaching career she had taken for granted that her slim figure made the task easy.  Now, there were complications.  The first time she turned at the front of the class to walk down the next aisle of desks her belly grazed the desk, knocking a young boy's book off.  She blushed, smiled, apologized, and the kids laughed, but Lindsay became even more self conscious than she already was.  Not only was her belly bumping into desks and students, but her her gate had changed enough that walking without banging her hips into the desks was impossible.  They weren't much wider than usual, but she was swaying more with each step and didn't know her own girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Lindsay had to sit down.  Her feet, her back, the stretched skin of her belly and breasts, were becoming agonizing.  She soothingly massaged her belly, not caring if the whole class saw her.  Her fingers kept catching her her belly button.  Even under her shirt was visible, but not deep like she would have thought.  It was starting to pop out, no doubt from her overindulgence lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch, Lindsay had had it.  She was ready to call it a day, to leave, maybe go home and sulk, or even go to a doctor like Amy kept suggesting.  She didn't think she could put up with another few hours of this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay suffered through the next few hours. She walked among the students less, and snapped at them when she did. She couldn't go more than a few feet without her belly bumping into something. She grew overheated quickly, eventually removing her cardigan. She regretted it, as without that buffer her belly looked even bigger. She couldn't help but constantly repeat to herself how huge she was, how fat she had been getting, so much so that it was getting awkward to even walk around.  She absolutely refused to think of her belly as anything but a big ball of fat that ruined her figure. That the rest of her, other than her breasts, hadn't grown was kept safely out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, she entered the teachers' lounge to some stares from her co-workers. She blushed, staring at the floor and, consequently, her belly. She tugged at her shirt.  Did it get even tighter? Or, she reconsidered the thought, had she gotten even bigger since she put it on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently so, according to Amy's look as Lindsay sat next to her after slowly lumbering over to get some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Lindsay,\" Amy said, staring in shock at her stomach. \"Are you bigger since this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than get angry, Lindsay sunk lower in her seat as her giant belly would allow, as she began cramming food into her mouth as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay, you need to see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just going to tell me to lose weight,\" Lindsay said, barely glancing at her friend, \"And I tell myself that enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Amy said soothingly. She gently placed a hand on Lindsay's belly. It was hard and firm, more than her own which had her significant pregnancy weight added to its size. Lindsay shuddered and turned to her, speaking more calmly than she usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do that, it makes me feel like a giant pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy removed her hand. \"You need to see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If working out with Carl doesn't work to shrink me down to normal I will, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay . . .\" Amy looked for a new topic, \"Are you ready for the PTA meeting tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm ready,\" Lindsay said, getting a little worked up, \"Ready for a bunch of obnoxious yuppies to come in and tell me how to do my job even though they can't raise their own kids right? I don't go into their homes and tell them how to parent, why do they think they can come here and tell me how to teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked a little surprised by Lindsay's response, but not too much given her mood lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do work for them, really. It's a good way to improve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't have any idea what we do here. I don't think it's right letting them come here and talk down to us like they have more experience with children than they do. We're with them all day for most days, I think we know a little better than them how to teach children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay, who had shoveled in nearly her entire piled on tray of food, stood up, bumping her belly into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof,\" she stumbled back a little, standing straight, arching her back and rubbing it gently. The entire lounge saw just how pregnant she looked now. \"Need to use the restroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lindsay left, Gary looked over to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy. So Lindsay is pregnant, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She hasn't mentioned anything about going on maternity leave,\" Maria said, her hand, as it often was now, pressed firmly into her recently swollen tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be due soon, like in a month or two?\" Pamela added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled awkwardly. She felt like an idiot telling her what Lindsay told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to tell you. Lindsay says she's not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary laughed.  \"Yeah, sure she's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just, you know, weight gain?\" Pamela asked. Amy shrugged. Lindsay's belly and breasts were getting huge but the rest of her was perfectly trim as always. If it wasn't pregnancy, Amy couldn't tell what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay's lunch didn't satisfy her for long. Her stomach rumbled the rest of the day.  By the time classes let out, and she prepared to go meet the parents of her students, she was famished. She grabbed some snacks from a vending machine and ate them on the spot, watching her bloated reflection in the glass. She didn't know whether to be frustrated or depressed at the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to chat with Amy before the conference. She slowly made her way to the gymnasium where it was being held. In the past she wasn't keen on having to straight from teaching to talking to parents, but today she was glad the PTA was holding their meeting right after classes. It would get it over with. She was especially glad it was more of an informal meet-and-greet rather than a meeting with a agenda where things would be discussed in an orderly fashion, as Maria always wanted to do. The other teachers uniformly shut that idea down whenever Maria brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd was something Lindsay never thought would be any kind of problem for her to maneuver through. And, through her entire life of being a petite and thin woman, it never was. But now, every time she turned she bumped into somebody or almost did. She mentally prepared a strategy for walking across the room. When she realized that she now had to maneuver herself like an ungainly ship in a dock, she placed her hands on her belly and growled quietly. At least so far, she had managed to avoid talking to the any of the parents. She was making her way to some more vending machines to calm her roaring stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ms. Walker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the two friendly voices of the Levins, parents of Jessica, one of Lindsay's best students. Lindsay stopped in her tracks and slowly turned, making sure not to bump her belly into the wall. The Levins' faces told her they were surprised by her new, rounder look, but they said nothing. They were all around pleasant people, as much so as their daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just want to say how proud we are of Jessica, she is doing really well in your class,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't think we don't know you have a lot to do with that!\" Ms. Levin said with a knowing smile and pointing a finger at Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lindsay said, eager to get to more food, \"Thank you so much. She's a, ah, she's a great student. I'm glad to have her in my class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're glad you're her teacher,\" Mr. Levin said, looking thoughtful, \"You know, she was kind of a late bloomer, didn't really get into the whole education thing under after other kids . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay felt her stomach turn with hunger. She rubbed her belly, again bemoaning how tight her already overly tight shirt had gotten. She must look like a stuffed sausage in her outfit, she thought, and still her biggest concern was filling her stomach even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Lindsay said meekly after the proud parents spoke for a minute, she turned without hesitating further and made a beeline for the vending machines in the corner of the room. Her belly nudged a few on the way, but only she minded. The other parents there just seemed to accept that Ms. Walker now needed a wider berth than she used to. As Lindsay crammed a couple of candy bars into her mouth hiding in the corner, hoping to do it quickly just to hold her over, she detected someone approaching. She was about to sit down in a chair as her feet, back, legs, really her whole body, was painfully aching after a day of standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Walker, can I have a word?\" the words were obnoxiously formal and condescending, and they came from a woman who was around eight months pregnant, but otherwise slim and in good shape. Lindsay glared. <i>I'm as big as a pregnant woman now,</i> she thought sadly. Even if she didn't already dislike Eileen Kamisky, mother of class part-time troublemaker Danny, she now felt another source of anger at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, of course,\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Danny needs more attention. He's a smart boy, you know, who just doesn't always think before he acts. I think he would really benefit from some extra attention from you, do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my students are important to me, Ms. Kamisky,\" Lindsay said with barely disguised disdain. She found herself staring at the woman's large belly, her hands listlessly rubbing it, and Lindsay didn't even realize that her own hands were now doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but Danny's a special child, don't you think?  He's so creative. I don't think you're fueling his creativity enough. Can you think of more ways to fuel his creativity?\" Lindsay developed an sudden dislike for the words 'fuel' and 'creativity' based solely on hearing them repeated by Ms. Kamisky. \"His creativity needs to be fueled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! It was so obvious. Lindsay forced a fake smile as she realized the best form of defense against overbearing soccer moms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are absolutely right, Ms. Kamisky,\" Lindsay said, implying she agreed all along. \"I can think of some special projects for some of the more gifted students in my class which Danny would be perfect to take part in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Kamisky beamed, feeling she had done her job and happy to be sucked up to. \"That's wonderful, Ms. Walker, simply wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay breathed a sigh of relief. It looked like Ms. Walker was leaving. Before she did, she gave a half turn back to Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And congratulations!\" she said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On what?\" Lindsay said, confused, her hand resting on top of her tight, round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your pregnancy of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay blushed, narrowed her eyes, and clenched her fists. Her first response was to start going off on this annoying woman, and her better judgment on had seconds to reel her in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay snapped.  She stormed the few feet to Eileen Kamisky so quicky their bellies grazed each other.  She was livid, her words coming out in angry spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>not</i> pregnant.  I <i>can't</i> get pregnant.  But if I <i>was</i> pregnant at least it would give me an excuse to tell you and your lazy, entitled, idiotic soccer mom friends how to raise your own kids right since I don't think any of you know the first thing about children.  But you still think you can tell <i>me</i> how to teach them.  I have more experience with them than any of you do, and I don't need you to tell me your kid is special.  Every kid is special and every parent comes here thinking theirs is better than the rest.  But they're not, and neither is yours.  Your son doesn't deserve more than anybody else and if you weren't such an ass you'd realize this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay wasn't exactly yelling, but Ms. Kamisky reacted as if she were.  There were more teachers nearby than parents, so the damage was at least minimized to an extent.  Ms. Kamisky looked more upset than angry herself, and attempted to stammer out a response, but Lindsay cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about any excuses, I get enough of those from those kids you never taught responsibility to!\" Lindsay grabbed her stomach suddenly and gasped, taking a step back.  Something lurched inside of her.  She felt strong, wiggling movements inside her.  It didn't feel like gas, it felt like there were things moving inside her.  \"Ah!\" she gasped again, grabbing around her expansive stomach, confused and scared.  \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around.  Ms. Kamisky stared back, as confused as her.  Lindsay felt a few more strong jerks inside her belly.  Breathing heavily, she bolted as much as her new waddling gait would let her, not even turning back to look, just holding her belly and hustling outside.  Whatever embarrassment she just brought upon herself was nothing compared to the panic she felt at the motions going through her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got outside and sat on a bench, breathing heavily.  The movements had stopped while she ran, or rather walked semi-swiftly.  She moved her hands across her round belly as she calmed down.  Her heart was still racing when Amy approached her, moving even more slowly than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay!\" Amy said, and Lindsay was surprised to see her half smiling, \"I heard you just told off that obnoxious Kamisky woman.  What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay held her belly, debating whether to tell Amy what she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.  I just went off on her.  She deserved.  Bunch of annoying yuppies.  But . . . something stopped me . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay didn't answer.  After a moment of silence.  Amy stood up, belly first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to get some lunch?  I think we've done enough damage for one night.  There's the buffet down the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" Lindsay stood up, using the same general motion as Amy did to stand, \"sounds lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs two large-bellied woman walking up to a buffet nobody gave a second thought to how much food both were taking.  Amy and Lindsay, however, both noticed how Lindsay was piling her plates up high.  She was eating more than Amy by far, and eating it faster, barely able to respond to Amy's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her third helping, Amy put on her concerned face again.  Lindsay's hand was pressed tightly into her lower belly.  Even though she knew she was always full now, and that her stomach had grown round and tight, she could feel it stretching again with the food she was eating.  She felt like she had another bump along with her already giant belly simply from stuffing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay . . .\" Amy started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay put her fork down and looked across the table.  \"I know.  I'm eating like a pig,\" she looked down at the empty plates, feeling her own taut belly and tugging on her shirt.  It was stretched well to its limit now, both around her belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both had their fill and were heading to the parking when Lindsay stopped suddenly.  Several strong lurching movements moved through her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah!\" she yelped, causing Amy to stop in her tracks as she doubled over and moved her hands all over her belly.  \"Oh god, what is that?\" she said with panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel, feel!\" Lindsay grabbed Amy's hands and put them on her belly.  She felt the movements.  They did, she knew from much experience, feel like babies kicking.  But it would have be a number of them, and they'd have to have grown pretty fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lindsay.  You need to call a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movements having subsided, Lindsay pushed Amy away and rushed to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't call your doctor because you're getting fat, Amy,\" Lindsay said, but her voice was shaking.  \"I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ride home, Lindsay felt weaker, but still disturbing, wiggling movements in her belly.  With a resigned sigh, she made an appointment for tomorrow after school.  As hard it was to accept that she had gotten so big so quickly, that something else-especially something obvious and specific-was wrong with her was harder to swallow.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay arrived home still frustrated but eager to fulfill her promise to herself to work out.  She knew if she didn't just do it she would never get her figure back in control.  With Carl to keep her motivated, she actually felt somewhat energetic even as she trudged her way through the door and nearly knocked the coat rack over by underestimating the size of her belly.  Carl was ready, or at least, he was already wearing clothes to work out in.  He didn't take much effort to dress up when he wasn't on business trips, and Lindsay could appreciate that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, honey, how was the PTA?\" Carl asked, getting up to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask,\" Lindsay said simply, wanting to put her explosion at an annoying but innocent parent behind her.  She squirmed in discomfort as Carl pressed his body into her belly and, she was reminded with a jolt, now swollen and sensitive breasts.  She pushed him away as gently as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to, uh,\" he paused and quickly tried to hide his surprise while gawking at her belly.  It was well past her breasts, and looked as heavy as it felt.  Lindsay knew how awkward she felt, but she still didn't have a full idea of just how huge she looked and how rapidly she had grown.  \"Ready to work out?\" Carl recovered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Lindsay said like she was waiting for him to ask.  \"Let's start with a jog around the neighborhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure . . .\" Carl said.  He watched Lindsay climb up the stairs, holding her belly and the railing.  From behind it was hard to tell anything had changed about her, although her hips had grown wider under the weight of her newly enlarged middle.  He had a hard time believing she would be able to jog, or even walk briskly, in her state.  Like Amy, he wanted to believe her that she wasn't pregnant.  He knew it wasn't possible, as she did.  Still, Lindsay's insistence that it was just regular weight gain was getting less and less believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay, stumbling over herself as she did so, changed into a pair of stretchy work out shorts and a tight tank top.  She regretted it instantly.  The middle over their dresser showed that her belly was fully visible, popped out naval and all, and the shirt was uncomfortably tight around her breasts.  She didn't work out often but she recalled thinking she looked pretty hot in that outfit before.  She very briefly teared up as she ran her hands over her belly.  She shook her head and stopped herself.  Yelling at parents, friends, and crying were not how she normally as, she knew.  She found a pair of sweat pants which she was able to pull up just under the curve of her belly.  She found one of Carl's old t-shirts.  It was mostly loose, even around her chest, but exposed half of her belly to the air.  She sighed.  It would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Carl putting on his jogging shoes downstairs.  He looked over and smiled, obviously avoiding looking at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was less excited than she was before.  She tugged at her shirt and with effort put her own shoes on.  Bending in the middle was getting difficult.  Carl offered to help her stand but she glared at him and, with a loud huff, stood up on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do some running,\" she said with a determined nod.  She didn't sound convinced anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good night for a jog.  The sky was clear and the air cool but not cold.  Lindsay was glad it was late enough that nobody else was strolling through their neighborhood, as within five minutes she was ashamed of herself.  Carl had sped up ahead, then slowed down so Lindsay could follow.  But it was no good.  She couldn't jog more than a few steps before she stumbled.  The bouncing of her belly and breasts was physically painful when she did get moving, and she just couldn't keep her balance.  Worse than that, she grew winded almost instantly.  Carl hadn't even broken a sweat but Lindsay was drenched by the time they got to the end of the block.  At that point, they had both decided to stroll rather than jog.  They reached the lamppost still within view of their house.  Carl stopped, but Lindsay continued on a few steps to lean against the post.  She was panting heavily, her face red and her clothes soaking.  Her sides, already tingly from her stretched skin, now ached as much as her breasts and thighs.  It was a moment before she could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Carl asked, putting a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't even walk half a block without feeling like this?\" she said, still panting.  She looked up into Carl's eyes with a mix of confusion and self-pity.  \"How did I let this happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Lindsay, I think it's . . . maybe something . . . \" he wasn't sure he was going with that, but stopped as Lindsay breathed in deeply and then grabbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt that twisting feeling again, like something rolling around inside her, pressing on the walls of her stomach and wiggling deep within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she yelped, holding her belly all over, forgetting her exhaustion.  \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Carl said, Lindsay had started to slide down the lamppost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Lindsay snapped at him.  She squirmed, pressing her belly tightly.  It wasn't painful, but it was not a pleasant feeling.  If it was gas, or indigestion, it wasn't the strangest she ever felt.  \"Feel my stomach.\"  She grabbed Carl's hand and pressed it over her tight, wet belly.  He didn't feel anything.  The feelings had faded away as quickly as they began.  He took his hand away and helped her stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it feel like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't describe it.  I don't know,\" Lindsay said.  For some reason the words \"something moving inside my belly\" were difficult to say out loud.  She held her belly.  Her heavy breathing caused it to rise in and out prominently, exaggerating her already bloated appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started walking back.  \"I set up an appointment tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" was all Carl said.  He put an arm around Lindsay's shoulder.  \"Don't feel too bad.  The first work out after not working out in a while is always a short on.  They'll get longer and easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay stared past her breasts to her heaving belly, rubbing it gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, I hope,\" Lindsay said, \"I can't keep going like this without some exercise.  I'll get huge.  I'm already huge,\" she added softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you gained that much weight,\" Carl said, obviously not telling the whole truth but not quite lying, \"And I think you're as beautiful as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay smiled, not believing him, \"Thanks, but I don't feel like it right now.  And, and . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay blushed as a rumble erupted from her stomach.  \"And I'm starving.  Let's get back home and get some dinner.\"</span></div></div>",

Carl followed a while after.  He couldn't help but stare at his wife to take in her changed figure as she lay on her side, her giant belly pushing before her.  He could only guess she was pregnant and in deep, deep denial, but the idea didn't make him less worried.  It couldn't be weight gain, he thought as he looked over her.  The rest of her was as thin as always.  Only her once flat belly and once small breasts had taken a hit, and now looked unnaturally huge on her thin body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay's alarm went off.  Normally Carl heard this and would instantly go back to sleep after glancing at Lindsay.  But today, the alarm continued.  He sat up, finding the bed empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay?\" he said, looking in the bathroom and finding no one.  He went downstairs.  A light came from the kitchen, along with rustling sounds.  As he approached, he could hear loud, rapid chewing, and a very strange, gurgling sound that he soon recognized as the amplified noise of a very hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found Lindsay standing in front of the fridge, taking out any food she found and cramming it in her mouth while her other hand rubbed the sides of her exposed, taut belly.  Even from behind, he found it hard to recognize her.  Even if the rest of her looked as lean as ever it looked like her hips had gotten wider, perhaps responding to the new weight placed upon them.  Her stance was wide and her posture slouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, honey,\" Carl said softly as he walked up to her.  She turned, her cheeks puffed out from food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph?\" she muttered, swallowed, then said dully, \"Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling today?\" Carl asked gently.  He put a hand on her shoulder but she shrugged him off.  She reached into the fridge and pulled out leftovers from last night.  Even in front of the fridge, he could see she was sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ruuuuuuuurg,</i> he belly gurgled.  Lindsay winced and rubbed her belly, but didn't stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she said.  \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh, made that appointment for after school, right?\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay turned on him, annoyance in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Carl, I'll go after school.\"  Her belly roared loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Lindsay said, her voice softening a little.  She turned a little towards him, and Carl found her even turning seemed to be an effort with all the extra weight she was carrying, \"I'm eating, okay?  I'll go after work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl decided to stay quiet for the time being.  He went upstairs to go back to sleep, but it was useless.  He heard Lindsay lumbering up the stairs.  He pretended to not notice her huffing and heaving as she tried to get dressed.  Only when he heard her cry a frustrated \"Oh, you have to be kidding me!\" did he sit up.  He found her standing by the closet, still wearing the tank top that showed most of her belly, with skirts and pants scattered around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to him and her expression softened a little.  \"Guess what?  I can't get anything up past my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, Lindsay-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay threw the skirt she was holding down with a grunt.  She reached for some sweatpants and, with maneuvering to avoid falling over, managed to get them on.  To appear somewhat professional, she threw a long cardigan on, although there was no hope of buttoning it.  She left for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay had to discover a new way to get into her car.  Gone were the days when she could just leap in.  Now, she had to sit down backwards first, and then turn to face the front.  Her belly hit the steering wheel.  She pushed the seat as far back as it would go.  It helped, but barely.  Without wasting a moment to feel sorry for herself, she went upstairs and found Carl wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said, blushing, \"Um, I, uh, can you drive me to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Carl said immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay wore that expression that showed she was half amused, half on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't fit behind the wheel,\" she said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Carl said.  He hugged her, but it was an awkward hug. Neither was used to the three enormous orbs squished between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me if anything happens,\" Carl said after a short, silent ride.  Lindsay, awkwardly as always now, leaned over and kissed him quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.  Thanks,\" she said.  Carl could tell she was making an effort to be, if not positive, at least normal.  \"Love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, too,\" Carl said.  He watched her waddle into the building slowly.  She was early today, and the school looked mostly deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay hoped she could make it to the teachers' lounge and in peace before anybody showed up.  She knew she looked horrible, and not just from the drastic change her figure had taken lately.  She wasn't dressed for school.  Her huge belly was half bare, her popped belly button just barely covered.  Her hair was a mess.  She had made the slightest effort to comb it.  So when she found the tired, but still professionally attired and made-up Principal Donner sitting in the lounge, she found her annoyance returning.  She suddenly remembered the scene she made the night before.  Yelling at a students' parents was generally frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Lindsay,\" Maria said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Lindsay sat down in her normal spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, it's standard practice for me to evaluate all the faculty after a PTA conference,\" Maria said, oblivious that Lindsay was trying not to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here it comes,</i> Lindsay sat back and sighed, resting her hands firmly on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't come.  Maria walked over to her, and while she seemed very tired and not very enthusiastic, had no ill will in her manner.  Also, Lindsay saw, her eyes popping out at the sight, Maria had gained a good bit of weight.  Her belly wasn't just puffy, but round, and she had clearly forgone her usual buttoned blouse in favor of a stretchier one more forgiving of her changes.  Her breasts had grown, too, and her face had a rounded look to it that actually added some youthfulness to her appearance.  Still, she looked as uncomfortable as Lindsay felt, and was doing her best to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sitting in with you first period this morning, if that's all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Lindsay said, looking up and down the Principal's body.  Maria, she saw, was doing the same to her but with obvious bewilderment.  \"So,\" Lindsay hazarded to say, hoping to bring it up rather than have it brought up, \"I guess you heard about last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard about it?\" Maria gave a weak smile and an even weaker laugh, \"I was there, remember? Don't worry about it, Lindsay.\"  Maria shook her head and turned to go.  Lindsay was more relieved than she thought she would have been.  She also suddenly felt a little bad for disliking the normally rule-crazy Principal.  \"If you could have met some of the parents when I started here you'd know that they were nothing like the spoiled soccer moms we have to deal with now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was all Lindsay could say, \"Thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Donner returned to her seat to read with the hint of a smile still on her face.  Lindsay almost cheered up, until that unsettling wiggling sensation hit her again.  She moaned softly, rubbed her stomach and hoped it would go away.  She glanced down and saw something bump up and move across the surface of her belly.  She gasped.  The wiggling stopped after that.  She felt an icy feeling in the pit of her stomach at the sight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay was able to slip out of the room before Amy arrived, and awkwardly waddled to her classroom.  \"Lindsay, a word before we continue?\"  Maria asked, slowly approaching her with a slight waddle herself.  \"Of course.\" Lindsay said.  Although she agreed to do it, standing still was starting to become painful due to the weight of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know that I said that you were off the hook for that little outburst last night, but I just received a fairly stern email from Mrs. Kamisky.  She said that she'd sue if you weren't reprimanded.  And well, you know that her husband is a lawyer...\" Principal Donner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Lindsay said.  \"So, as your punishment, I've decided to make you a chaperone for tomorrow's field trip to the museum. It'll last until 2 or so, but you can go home once you get back. Amy, Pamela, and Gary are the other chaperones.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. I think that's fair.\" As Lindsay replied, something pushed hard against her belly, so hard that even Maria could see it.  It was starting to do so in multiple places and showed no signs of stopping.  \"AH!\" Lindsay grimaced, clutching her bulging midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked at her with concern.  \"Are you hurt?\" she asked.  \"I...no.  It's just really uncomfortable...\" she said, rubbing her belly to try to stop the movement to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria placed her hands on the side of Lindsay's belly. To her shock, something pushed back against both of her hands.  \"Lindsay...I heard you talk yesterday about your...fertility struggles, but...are you SURE?\" she asked.  \"I...yes. Maria, please.  I...I can't be pregnant. I just can't be, okay?\" she said, calming down as the movement had began to cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  But...I'm concerned, Lindsay.  I really am.\" Principal Donner said.  \"Well, if it's any consolation I'm going to see a doctor after school. Shall we go in?\" Lindsay asked.  \"After you.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf class was difficult for Lindsay yesterday, today was nearly impossible.  If Maria wasn't sitting in on today's class, she would definitely spend the day at her desk, but she couldn't seem inconsiderate to her students with the principal in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay walked around the room as her students worked on an assignment.  As she walked through the aisles, her huge belly grazing her students' shoulders.  \"Sorry.\" she muttered as she passed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Walker?\" a student behind her asked.  Lindsay turned quickly--a little too quickly--and knocked over another student's desk with her belly.  \"OH!\" she gasped, picking the desk back up.  Lindsay looked over to Principal Donner, who quickly looked away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch, she was exhausted. Lindsay had removed her cardigan due to the heat she was feeling. Because of this, her belly looked absolutely monstrous.  <i>Kinda looks like my sister did when she had the twins...</i> Maria thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was in a deep sweat, and was panting uncontrollably. Her belly heaved in and out as she tried to catch her breath.  At this point, she couldn't tell if it was just her catching her breath or those reoccurring movements.  Or both.  And of course, her stomach was constantly rumbling.  Lindsay couldn't be sure, but she could have sworn that it had grown since she woke up.  She was more than relieved when the bell finally rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lindsay, you've got a great reputation here for a reason.  Your devotion towards educating these children is unmatched.\" Maria said as the two made their way to the cafeteria.  \"Thanks.  I try my best.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot!  When was the last time you had a story time session?\" she asked.  Even though Lindsay taught 4th graders, the principal still thought that reading stories to the kids was important. These story time sessions were held every three weeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...I guess it's about that time to.  I can do it after lunch!\" Lindsay offered. \"Great to hear!  I...I hope that everything works out with the doctor today.\" Maria said.  \"Thanks...\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay entered the cafeteria and piled her tray with food.  As she got her food, she saw Gary and Pamela enter.  If she didn't know any better, she'd swear that they were both rounder around the middle.  She waddled to the table and carefully sat down next to Amy, who was staring at Lindsay's belly. \"Hey. Didn't get to talk to you this morning.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that.  I had to talk to Maria.\" Lindsay said.  \"It's okay.  Listen, do you...wanna borrow some of my clothes?  I don't want to sound mean but...you've kinda outgrown everything you've got.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, but thanks for the offer.  I think I'll get some bigger clothes after the appointment.  Argh stop!\" she said to her belly.  The movement began again, and Amy felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay...At your appointment, you need to request an ultrasound.  Can you do that?  For me?\" Amy asked.  \"If they can't find anything, I'll ask as a last resort.\" Lindsay replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the classroom, Lindsay got her students to sit in a circle as she grabbed a book to read to them.  Lindsay waddled to her desk and sat down, opening the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Walker?\" Jessica asked.  \"Yes, Jessica?\" Lindsay asked, one hand resting on her belly.  \"How come you aren't sitting in the middle of the circle like usual?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I'd try something new this time...\" Lindsay said, realizing that her excuse was a weak one.  \"But it's not story time if you aren't sitting in the middle!\" one student claimed.  \"Join us!\" another one chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. You all win.\" Lindsay said, heaving herself up belly first.  The class cheered loudly.  Lindsay waddled over to the circle and bumped Danny's head with her belly as she stepped inside.  \"Sorry!\" she said, but deep down she really wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay carefully lowered herself to the floor and crossed her legs.  Her belly sat heavily on her lap.  \"Okay...\" she huffed reassuringly.  She began to read the book to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay noticed the class was more attentive than usual as she read.  That, or they were all gawking at her monstrous stomach.  Lindsay read a few chapters of the book, and story time was officially over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer students began to stand up and return to their desks.  Lindsay attempted to get up off of the floor, but found out that she couldn't.  Her belly simply weighed too much.  She began to sweat and looked around nervously.  After a few more attempts, she plopped back onto the floor with a heavy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis amount of activity caused the movements in her belly to begin once more.  \"Um...can I get a little help here?\" she asked, blushing.  Two students were brave enough to accept, and approached her.  They tried their best, but couldn't do it.  Two more students joined in and failed.  Finally, eight of her students were able to successfully lift her off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was fairly uneventful, except for the constant snack breaks, restroom runs, and frequent movements in her stomach.  The final bell finally rang, and Lindsay waddled to the parking lot.  Carl was waiting for her in the car, his hands nervously rubbing the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay heaved herself into the passenger seat.  \"You ready?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even in Carl's larger sedan Lindsay was cramped in there.  Her belly pushed out nearly to the dashboard, her knees forced into the door and center console by its size.  It rumbled, loudly, amplified in the tiny space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop and get some food, first?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Carl said, glancing at her half-exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been eating all day, but I'm still hungry.  It's always like that lately,\" she said softly, rubbing her belly, then added quickly with bitterness, \"No wonder I'm getting so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hun, you're not fat,\" Carl said, but he didn't sound convinced himself and found it harder and harder to take his eyes of Lindsay's enormous middle.  Lindsay said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey picked up some fast food, two meals for Lindsay, and drove to the doctor's.  Lindsay was depressed and nervous, and didn't devour her food as quickly as she had been.  They were in Dr. Monroe's parking lot and Lindsay was still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit stalling,\" Carl said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not stalling,\" Lindsay said, her mouth full, \"it takes a while to fill me up these days, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I didn't mean anything,\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay leaned back with a loud groan and grabbed her belly, then swallowed.  She felt those movements again, hard, deliberate, and everywhere within her massive sphere of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah,\" she groaned.  It didn't just feel strange, it was uncomfortable when she thought there was no way she could be more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel, feel,\" Lindsay said.  Bumps rose up and down on her belly, which shook back and forth in the confined space.  Lindsay winced.  The more this happened, the more her original concern was replaced by frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl felt it.  He knew exactly what it felt like, although none of them had ever felt so many such movements in one person before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" Lindsay cooed again, trying to shift in her seat but her added weight made it impossible for her.  She rubbed the bumps as Carl kept his hands on her belly.  There was plenty of room for both.  She grunted in frustration when they failed to stop after a minute, and pounded the side of the car with her still slender fists.  \"What's happening to me?\" she almost yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish eating and let's go inside,\" Carl finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lindsay agreed.  Her belly was starting to calm down as she finished her food.  She still needed help to get out of the car, and to remain upright during the first few steps once she was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKacy, Dr. Monroe's assistant, gawked at Lindsay as she entered.  Lindsay had only had a check up just three months before, and Kacy knew of her fertility issues.  She greeted them, her eyes fixated on Lindsay's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi, Lindsay, Carl.  Dr. Monroe will be with you in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will people stop staring at me like that?\" Lindsay said glaring at Kacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, it's just, you know, well,\" Kacy fumbled with some papers to get out of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKacy called the doctor and told them the Walkers were here.  Before they even sat down they heard her voice over the speaker phone saying to bring them back.  Kacy stood up behind her desk and opened the door leading to the back office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Monroe is ready for you now,\" she said.  Lindsay felt an intense and uncharacteristic, for her usually, dislike for the tiny, bubbly young woman.  She also felt the same satisfaction she had with her co-workers when she noted that the young girl was getting a bit of a belly herself, and it must have been recent since her shirt and dress pants were not big enough to cover.  She must have saw Lindsay glancing at it, and patted it with a bemused grin, but said nothing.  Lindsay was too busy focusing straight ahead, but as Carl glanced behind Kacy's desk he noticed, sitting in an otherwise empty trash bin, a vaguely familiar can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Monroe was looking over Lindsay's medical history files when her and Carl entered.  Lindsay's belly entered several seconds before the rest of her, and once her face entered, she was greeted with yet another shocked look from a doctor who shouldn't have been surprised to see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay!\" Dr. Monroe said.  Lindsay blushed, rubbing her belly.  \"How?\" was all she could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know . . .\" Carl and Dr. Monroe helped Lindsay to the examination table, where she plopped down heavily in a chair next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was anybody else I'd say you were pregnant with multiples,\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay, looking past her cartoonishly inflated breasts to her impossibly huge belly, and realizing if she wanted to stand up again she would certainly need help, burst into tears at the doctor's words.  She consoled her, and Carl stood behind her with his hands on her shoulders.  The frustration of her body changing so much and suddenly acting so different than normal finally broke.  After a moment, though, she mostly had herself together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop eating,\" she finally said.  \"Everything is getting so big,\" she added with more sniffling.  Dr. Monroe could quickly tell this wasn't true.  Only her belly and breasts had changed, the rest of her was as thin as it always was.  \"I can hardly move anymore, and nothing fits.  I look like a blimp and feel like a freak.  I just want to be back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out what's wrong with you, Lindsay,\" Dr. Monroe said calmly.  Since she was aware of her fertility problems, and that even if she was pregnant she was way beyond three months judging by her size, but she had several ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Monroe's first move was to weigh her.  Lindsay's weight, usually a slim and healthy 120 pounds, as it had been since college with little variation, was one of the things Lindsay could always count on to be constant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, 183 . . .\" Dr. Monroe said, writing on her clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lindsay screamed, clutching her belly.  She couldn't believe she could ever be so heavy.  She looked at Carl, who was watching with interest and concern but remaining calm, then looked away ashamed.  She imagined him thinking angry thoughts about how fat his hot wife had gotten and resented him for her imagining those thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you go in there and fill this up?\" Dr. Monroe handed Lindsay a small cup.  Lindsay sulked into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's not pregnant, then what it is?\" Carl asked once Lindsay closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, it could be a number of things.  It could be a tumor,\" he said bluntly, \"But that wouldn't explain why her breasts have grown.  It could be a false pregnancy, but I have never seen anyone get this big from that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we'll just have to find out then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give her an ultrasound.  That should settle this immediately.  When did you notice that she started to grow?\" Carl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was away for a few weeks, so it could have been any time then.  But, wait a minute,\" he thought back to when he arrived home on Sunday night.  He specifically remembered, as he always did fondly, seeing his wife for the first time in weeks and, and always, remarking to himself how beautiful she was.  He was positive, now that he thought about, her perfectly trim figure was in tact on Sunday.  \"Huh.  I think . . . it started Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This last Monday?  Do you mean she grew this much in just five days?\" Dr. Monroe said, disbelieving.  She could see the concern grow deeper in Carl's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  And these last few days she's been talking about how fat she's getting and how she can't believe she let herself go, but it just felt like, I don't know, like it was over time and both of us were just noticing for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help,\" Lindsay grunted from the bathroom.  Carl and Dr. Monroe went to help her off the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay, I'd like to do a sonogram for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not pregnant,\" she said in a frustrated, almost childish tone, as Carl helped her with great difficulty onto the examination table, \"Just fat,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" she said, \"Carl says that you first noticed the changes only this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I guess I was in denial, right?  I mean, you know how thin I always used to be.  It was just the shock of it, you know, suddenly getting so big?\" they could both see the gears moving in her mind as she thought back.  Had it only been a week?  Wasn't she completely normal just last week?  She was hanging out with Amy last Saturday, she recalled, and remembered a comment Amy made.  It was about as big as Amy was she was never as thin as Lindsay, so she didn't really feel as big by comparison as she ought to.  Lindsay barely registered it at the time.  She rubbed her belly, her brow wrinkled, trying to grasp what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody gains sixty pounds in a week,\" she said, trying to backpedal to the more believable position that she had, in fact, just been in denial for months while she let herself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Monroe rolled the sonogram out of its cabinet.  In a minute, they would find out.</span></div></div>",

As she lifted up her shirt, blushing at the sight of her giant, bare belly, ripples moved across its surface.  She groaned.  These sensations were growing stronger every time.  As Dr. Monroe went to turn the sonogram on, Lindsay stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she said, \"Is this even necessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay,\" Carl said, standing behind with a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't there other tests you want to do?\" Lindsay asked Dr. Monroe.  There was a note of panic in her voice.  \"Oh!\" she grabbed her stomach when a particular strong sensation bulged outward.  She closed her eyes and nodded to Dr. Monroe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor moved the probe over her stomach.  Her and Carl looked at the screen, but Lindsay just gazed down at her belly, now seeing the movements that began deep inside her and then seemed to rise to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" she heard Dr. Monroe say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Carl asked.  Lindsay turned to the screen, not knowing what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, her voice shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Dr. Monroe repeated.  \"You're definitely pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was speechless.  He squeezed Lindsay's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Lindsay asked.  Her heart beat faster.  Looking from the screen to her belly, she could feel a panic attack coming on.  \"How is that possible?  You know I can't get pregnant, we've known for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" Dr. Monroe continued in a professional tone, \"One . . . two .  . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl and Lindsay realized she was counting how many fetuses she was looking at, and both interjected another loud \"What?\" as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she turned to them.  Normally in a situation like this a congratulations would be in order, but the confusion and, in Lindsay's case, actual shock, told her that she should break this gently.  \"I think I see eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight!\" Lindsay shouted.  Her breathing was coming faster now, her heavy belly and breasts shaking dangerously as she pushed away the doctor's probe and tried to pull her shirt down to cover her belly.  She was trying to sit up and found it impossible without help.  She wished Carl and Dr. Monroe would leave.  She wished everyone would leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're about five months along judging by their development.  It would explain why you're so big,\" Dr. Monroe started to continue but stopped, seeing Lindsay's expression.  She was staring at her belly and gripping it tightly, a look of mingled astonishment and disgust on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's impossible,\" she said, sitting up with Carl's help, but pushing him away immediately.  \"It has to be something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hun, look at the screen.  Look at you,\" Carl said softly, \"I don't believe it either-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay forced her unwieldy body to her feet and waddled a few steps, bumping into the sonogram and the table at once.  Clearly a lot of emotions were going through her head right then, and as shocked as Carl was he was at least sensitive enough to know that Lindsay clearly had a lot more on her mind right now than he did.  He could see her trying not to react with anger but also not actively trying to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried for years and we accepted that I can't get pregnant,\" she said, stepping away from Carl and Dr. Monroe, who remained silent.  \"And now-eight?  Octuplets?  And I'm five months along in five days?  Is this some kind of joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently she actually wanted an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how this happened, Lindsay.  But it's happened,\" Dr. Monroe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay rubbed her stomach as another wave of kicking went on inside her.  She grunted and moaned in frustration.  She moved her hands to her aching back and leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?\" she asked.  She had a very strong desire to get as far away from her own body as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl spread his arms and walked towards her.  Lindsay accepted his hug but didn't return it.  She knew what he was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get through it,\" he said, and hearing it made her calm down a little.  Her breathing was steady again, and she no longer wanted to lash out at the doctor.  Carl didn't think now was the right time to bring up that they would be parents.  They would both have to accept that she was, in fact, pregnant with octuplets and growing fast first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to set up another appointment.  Tomorrow.  I suggest you go on bed rest,\" Dr. Monroe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be a whale but I can still do my job,\" Lindsay said, sounding more irritated than panicked now.  Dr. Monroe and Carl did not weigh on the issue right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey discussed the next appointment briefly.  Lindsay just wanted to get out of there.  Carl was running out of things to say.  He hadn't worked out how he felt about this whole situation himself.  They left the doctor's office, catching Kacy curiously poking at her own puffy belly as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to?\" Carl asked once they were in the car.  Both had lapsed into silence.</span></div></div>",

I need some clothes that'll actually fit.\" Lindsay said, her hands resting on her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, no offense, but with the rate you've been growing...do you think you'll be able to fit into anything going forward.\" Carl asked, backing out of the parking lot.  \"It's worth a shot, right?\" Lindsay asked.  \"Whatever you say.\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the shopping mall, Lindsay couldn't help but feel that people were staring at her.  Then again, a woman with a belly like hers wasn't an everyday occurrence, but it still made her uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the maternity store was pretty difficult for Lindsay.  Her feet and back ached, and to add onto that her belly was constantly rumbling.  No doubt it was amplified by the nearby food court.  Carl had to stop and slow down constantly as Lindsay lagged behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the maternity story, Lindsay waddled to the nearby employee, as Carl slowly followed her.  \"Excuse me. Do you have any clothes for someone expecting multiples?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee turned around and was taken back at Lindsay's belly.  \"Oh, my! Y-yes, we do. Though, I must ask. Isn't it a little late for you to be getting maternity clothes?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I have a few more months left.  Listen, I'm sorta in pain here walking around. Do you think you could pick out some clothes for me? I was going to wait in the changing room\" Lindsay said, waddling after the employee.  \"Oh...okay.  I was a little busy.  Are you sure your husband couldn't pick them out for you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen how he dresses? I'd prefer someone that deals with pregnant women daily to help.\" Lindsay said.  \"Fair enough.  I'll be back in a few minutes.\" she said, heading off as Lindsay and Carl made their way to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait was fairly awkward, as the couple remained silent.  \"So...how are you feeling?\" Carl asked.  \"Other than feeling like a blimp and having a soccer team inside of me?  Just peachy, thanks.\" Lindsay said, her hands not leaving her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?  Did I do something to you?\" Carl asked.  \"It's just...I don't know how I'm going to do this, Carl! Eight babies...I just don't know!\" she said.  Carl sat down next to her.  \"We'll do it together.  I'm here for you, Lindsay.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe employee entered the changing room with a heap of clothes.  \"Oookay.  I've got some maternity jeans for you and a few blouses and shirts.  We ran out of dresses, unfortunately. We've had a bit of a boom in sales the past few days.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay thanked her, and began to try on the clothes.  The jeans actually fit pretty well, no doubt due to the elastic waistbands.  The shirts were a little snug, but at least they fit.  Lindsay and Carl purchased the clothes and made their way to the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay sat down heavily at a nearby table as Carl went to get food.  He returned with three treys.  Two were for Lindsay, who's treys were piled with burgers, Chinese food, or pizza, while Carl's trey only had a couple of slices of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate in relative silence, mainly because Lindsay was too focused on eating.  After nearly and hour of Carl getting more food for Lindsay, she was full.  Carl helped her up, and they made their way to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home, Carl carried Lindsay's bags of clothes for her.  The phone began to rang.  \"I'll get it.\" Carl said, putting the bags on the couch.  Lindsay waddled to the couch as well. She lifted her shirt up as her babies started to kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl picked up the phone and answered.  \"Hello?  Hey, mom.  No, sorry, we just got back from the mall.  Just doing some shopping, that's all.  The trip was good, yeah.  Oh, really?  T-tomorrow?  No, it's fine, it's just...a little unexpected, that's all.  Ok, then.  I'll see you...tomorrow, I guess.  Hope you feel better, love you.\" Carl hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay heaved herself off of the couch and waddled towards Carl.  \"Who was that?\" Lindsay asked.  \"Oh, my mom.\"  Carl said.  \"Really, what did she want?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...she and dad are going to visit for a week.\" Carl said, clearly nervous about what Lindsay would say.  \"When?\" Lindsay asked.  \"Well...tomorrow.\" Carl replied sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay exploded.  \"Tomorrow?!  Who does she think she is coming on such short notice? And what about the house?  I haven't cleaned, it's a mess!\" Lindsay exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the house?  What about THIS?\" Carl asked gripping his wife's pregnant stomach.  Lindsay looked down.  \"Oh, yeah.  That too.  Carl, you have to call her back and tell her they can't come.  Tell her I have the flu or something.\" Lindsay said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's already sick.  Stomach bug or something. And she already dropped off Sparky with the dog sitter.  It's too late.\" Carl said.  \"Oh, damn it, Carl!\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl?  What did I do?\" he asked.  \"Have HER as your mom.  Whatever, I'm going to bed.  Good night.\" Lindsay said, trudging upstairs.  He watched his pregnant wife climb the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mother of my children...\" he muttered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay wanted to storm up the stairs, slam the bedroom door, and throw at least one object.  Normally throwing a fit like that would be very out of character for her, but she was probably more frustrated, angry, and confused than she had ever been in her life and taking out that on something inanimate would have made her feel a lot better.  But she couldn't.  She lumbered rather than stormed, and by the time she got upstairs she wasn't even as furious as she was at Carl.  She knew he always had trouble saying no to his mother.  He really didn't like her any more than Lindsay did.  Other than a few almost tender moments at long intervals in their marriage, Lindsay and Carl's mother had never gotten along.  She could only imagine what she'd think about her being pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lindsay knew that's not why she was feeling like this.  She also knew she couldn't blame it entirely on the hormones, which she now knew to be coursing through her erratically, turning her usually mellow demeanor upside down at random.  That was at least as unpleasant as the flurry of kicks rocking through her belly.  Awkwardly, she got undressed.  She wanted to shut her mind off for a while and not think about this.  It was too much to take in so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down, Lindsay fell into a fitful sleep.  She dreamed on and off throughout the night, tossing and muttering.  She dreamed she was her old slim self again, moving gracefully without any difficulty.  She went to work, and realized the entire classroom was full of her kids.  Before she could used to it, she felt those movements in her belly again, and found her flat stomach had been replaced by the enormous belly she had come to hate.  Her dreams went in and out in this fashion all night, until her alarm went off and she felt like she didn't get any sleep at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling, and her walk really was a pure waddle now, swaying side to side with each heavy step, towards the bathroom Lindsay was all too aware that she did feel heavier than yesterday.  A look in the mirror revealed this to be so.  Her belly stuck out of her thin body several feet in front of her, and were starting to dwarf her also swollen breasts.  The shirt she slept in had ridden up completely.  She moved her hands along the tight skin, feeling the flickering movements inside and the occasional bump rising to the surface.  At least, she noticed, there were no stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did I miss this?</i> she thought to herself.  She felt like an idiot for not noticing the signs, however much her medical history discouraged her.  With a sigh, she turned to get dressed, and found Carl already awake and getting dressed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, hun,\" he said with a weak smile.  She returned it.  Lindsay started to bend down to pick the jeans from the bags of clothes Carl had brought upstairs and nearly fell over.  Carl rushed over to help.  Last night she would have lashed out at him, humiliated at being so big she couldn't even dress herself, but this morning she accepted his help willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said as Carl held her up so she could pull the jeans up.  They fit fine, but she knew the elastic in the front must be stretched more.  \"How do they look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Carl said, moving his eyes up and down her legs and making sure she saw him checking out her ass in an exaggerated way.  She smirked at him, and then tossed on one of the oversized maternity sweaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be nice,\" she said as she pulled it over belly, \"to be, you know, fully clothed today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went down for breakfast, which Carl had prepared the night before in anticipation of not having enough time to make the huge meals Lindsay now required.  She ate quickly, no longer bothering to feel ashamed for making a pig of herself in front of Carl.  The two of them seemed to have silently agreed to not discuss this pregnancy for the moment, and that suited Lindsay just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is a field trip really punishment?\" Carl asked as he drove his wife to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really,\" Lindsay says, \"I don't mind dealing with the kids in public, at least.  The other teachers don't, so much.  I think Marie just had to give me something that sounded like a reprimand.  She was going to let me off the hook before Danny's mom called to complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's looking out for you, I guess,\" Carl said.  Lindsay was less pleased the more she thought about it.  It occurred to her that she'd have to be on her feet all day.  They were already sore just from going downstairs and to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, to herself, Lindsay actually was more self-conscious now that she was wearing proper maternity clothes.  As she slowly navigated her way to the teacher's lounge, she happened to see Pamela going in before her.  She didn't recognize her, at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's gotten fat,</i> Lindsay thought, <i>That's a shame.</i> She felt bad for the young teacher.  Having changed quite a bit recently she found it easy to sympathize with the petite Pamela, recalling her she felt when she first started showing.  And clearly Pamela wasn't going through the same thing as Lindsay, though.  Her face looked puffy and her ass wider, in addition to the out of place potbelly she now sported.  The poor girl was practically bursting out of her skirt and the tight t-shirt she wore did nothing to hide her gain.  On that train of thought, Lindsay only casually noticed that Gary was looking a little chubby himself.  But she merely made a mental note of that, and continued to think of Pamela.  It was easier psychologically to focus on what she must be going through than her own bigger problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam's boyfriend broke up with her last week,\" Lindsay turned and found Amy was sitting down.  Lindsay felt a brief but very powerful desire to cry. <i>Oh my god, I'm bigger than Amy.</i> It passed.  Her belly was bigger than her friend's, but at least she hadn't gained any of the other pregnancy weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were looking at Pamela, right? Her boyfriend broke up with her last week.  She's pretty depressed about it.  I guess she's, um, eating her sorrow away,\" Amy shrugged. \"So, doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  We went yesterday . . . you were right, I am pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy burst into a smile, then looked confused, then shrugged again.  She didn't know how to read Lindsay's delivery of the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay smiled back.  \"We'll . . . talk more about it later, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far along are you, can you tell me that?\" Lindsay could sense Amy's excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only five months?\" Amy said.  Apparently how quickly Lindsay had gotten to five months had escaped her notice, but Amy was very clearly referring to Lindsay's size.  \"Are you carrying more than one in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amy could respond, Principal Donner entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, fellow teachers,\" she said, loudly but unable to mask her exhaustion.  \"Thank you for volunteering to chaperon this field trip.  You know I feel very strongly about giving out students more than just a classroom education . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, think she's bigger than Pam?\" Amy whispered to Lindsay.  Lindsay nodded.  Marie had indeed filled out, particularly in her middle.  She looked horribly uncomfortable crammed in her dress clothes.  The buttons on her blouse were all spread wide, some revealing the tank she wore underneath to hide the fact, and others, right above her dangerously strained pants buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . good luck on your trip, and I hope you learn as much from our students as they learn from us,\" she ended in a variation of the same thing she said at almost every remotely speech-like opportunity she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay, Amy, Pamela, and Gary all, less quickly than they otherwise would have, went to meet their students.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The four teachers put on their best faces for their students, although it was obvious that only Amy was convincingly pleasant.  The students, young as they were, must have picked up on this.  From the moment they got on the bus they more and more would defer to Amy rather than risk speaking one of the other snappy teachers.  Even Gary, who was generally a jovial, uncle-like figure to his students, was in no mood to put up with childish antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay and Amy sat next to each other in very cramped conditions.  Lindsay's wide belly barely fit between the seats, and once seated was pressed uncomfortably against the seat in front of her.  Even Amy wasn't quite so big even if the rest of her had plumped up some.  And the kicking only got worse, especially with the front of her belly pressed against the seat.  By the end of the hour long ride Lindsay was holding the sides of her belly and panting softly, the discomfort turning to pain.  Amy tried to cheer her up, but had to contend with the students who were now seeing her as the only safe teacher to talk to.  Even the quiet Pamela was scowling at students who tried to speak with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I just fit when we came on the bus,\" Lindsay whispered as they exited.  Amy glanced over her friend's shoulder and saw what she meant.  She now had to squeeze her belly between the seats as she waddled forward.  Lindsay kept her hands firmly rubbing her belly, wondering if her maternity clothes would even last the day with how quickly she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe museum should have been a peaceful trip.  It wasn't.  The kids were all over the place, and Amy seemed to be the only one with the energy to actually chase them to keep them in line.  Lindsay tried, but within a half hour had to take her first break and sit down for twenty minutes with her shoes off.  Her feet were aching and swelling so much she needed help getting them back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay, I know it's rough what you're going through, and you didn't expect it, and, well, you're not as used to this as I am,\" Amy said, taking a breather next to her friend, \"But can you help me out a little here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Lindsay said, not really paying attention.  She wanted to close her eyes and let her body pass out.  Everything ached, from her sore feet, her legs ill-equipped to deal with all this extra weight, and the skin of her belly and breasts feeling so stretched that every movement sent a stinging pain throughout them.  She found herself watching Pamela across the museum now.  <i>Poor Pamela,</i> Lindsay thought, not for the first time happy to take her mind off her own troubles and focus on her co-worker.  Pamela was almost waddling, Lindsay saw.  She saw her chase after two kids trying to sneak into some Egyptian exhibit.  Having deterred them, she planted her hands on her back and arched her belly forward, revealing a little of its round surface from under her overly tight t-shirt.  Her tiny ass, Lindsay noticed, had gotten huge.  She was practically pudgy now.  If the rest of her body had remained as petite as it always was, her belly would certainly make her look pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . why are you staring at Pamela like that?\" Amy asked, bringing Lindsay back to reality.  She found she had dozed off while gently massaging her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel bad for her,\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.  Come on, let's get back to the kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood up with her usual difficulty while Lindsay needed a hand.  They walked towards Pamela who had turned her head to gently admonish the two kids for running off while a group she had already corralled ran off while her back was turned.  She turned to see them flee into some other room and moaned loudly.  Lindsay thought she might cry with frustration, but then she saw the other teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got this,\" Amy said with a bright smile as she hurried towards the fleeing students.  Amy actually found chasing kids around museums and theme parks fun, not annoying as the other teachers clearly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing?\" Lindsay asked, her voice tired and expressing the desire to not actually listen to that long an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela, Lindsay assumed based on her past behavior, would shrug this off and say \"fine.\"  Instead, she glowered at Lindsay with wide, almost panicked eyes.  She said it quietly, looking down at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called Kevin yesterday,\" she said, who Lindsay assumed was her boyfriend, \"and he said I was probably just getting fat.  But I think I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen a doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Have you?\" Pamela suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lindsay said, \"And I am pregnant.  I should have listened to Amy or I would have known sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was all Pamela said.  She rubbed her stomach, her now round face looking down at it sadly.  Lindsay could almost tell what she was thinking.  As much as she hated thinking she was gaining weight and losing her figure due to her own laziness and diet, right up until she found she vehemently resisted the idea that she was pregnant.  Lindsay imagined Pamela was going through a similar thought process, although without somebody there with her to go through it with.  She patted her on the shoulder, and then walked off to look after the kids.  Gary looked like he could use some relief, too.  Come to think of it, he was putting on weight, too.  He was a heavy guy to begin with, but not unhealthily so.  Now he was definitely getting a beer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gary, need a hand?\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do!\" Gary said with much relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the whole day to tire the students out.  But they only regained their energy on the bus ride home.  Lindsay was dozing off again when she heard Amy get a call on her cell phone.  She heard Amy give a couple of short answers to questions Lindsay couldn't hear.  When she hung up, she nudged Lindsay.  Obviously there was news here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Marie, she wants to see all of us when we get back.  She sounded worried.\"</span></div></div>",

Amy stood up and walked down the aisle.  Lindsay stood up, and was shocked that she barely squeezed out of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, I was almost stuck there.  I....am I bigger?\" she asked, mainly to herself.  Amy turned around to see what Lindsay was talking about.  \"Well, your sweater's riding up.\" Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her maternity sweater was now too small, revealing the bottom sliver of her pregnant mass.  She tugged on it, but it was no use.  \"Great. Too big for maternity clothes already.\" she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four teachers made their way to Maria's office.  \"So what was she talking to you about?\" Gary asked.  \"I don't know. It seemed like it was important, though.\"  Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the office and Pamela knocked on the door, which was usually open.  \"Come in.\" a worried voice answered.  They obliged, as Maria stood behind her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons on her strained blouse had popped at some point during the day, exposing her shockingly protruding belly. A few stretch marks were visible, and it was perfectly round, almost like a basketball.  The button on her pants was also now incredibly strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" Gary said.  \"So...how was the field trip?\" Marie asked, her voice shaky.  \"Maria, please. What do you need?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see a doctor immediately. And Pamela does too, by the looks of it. I think I'm pregnant...\" Maria said.  \"Well, yeah. I mean you're as big as Amy. But think you are?\" Gary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm 52 and haven't had sex in years for crissake!  I mean, I've taken five pregnancy tests today and they've al come back positive, but...it can't be true.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, we can go to the doctor right now. I have an appointment in an hour anyway.\" Lindsay said.  \"Okay. Amy, can we take your minivan?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We need someone to drive, though. That bus ride took a lot out of me. Gary?\" Amy asked.  \"Eh, whatever.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five big-bellied teachers piled into Amy's minivan.  Amy sat in the passenger's seat as Lindsay, Maria, and Pamela sat in the back.  Lindsay was squished between them. Her belly pressed against Maria and Pamela's rounded stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that appointment go yesterday, Lindsay?\" Maria asked.  \"Well, I'm pregnant. Very, very pregnant.\" she replied. \"Oh. Congratulations.\" Maria said. She looked down and held her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Dr. Monroe's office and headed inside.  Lindsay approached Kacy, who was sitting at the receptionist's desk.  \"Hi. If Dr. Monroe doesn't mind, we're gonna need a few extra ultrasounds done.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.  I'll tell her right away.  You can go ahead and head back. It's the same room as yesterday.\" Kacy said.  She stood up and rushed to the restroom. Lindsay noticed that her belly was much bigger than it was yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the examination room, Dr. Monroe was waiting for them.  There were a few more chairs placed in the room.  \"Oh, wow.  So who wants to go first?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go!\" Gary laughed.  \"Gary, please. I'm sure the doctor has other things to do. Let's not waste her time.\" Amy said.  \"Oh, come on. It'll take a minute.\" Gary said.  \"Fine. Just get up on the table.\" Dr. Monroe said, turning the machine on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary got on the table with more effort than expected.  He lifted up his shirt, revealing his own round belly.  Dr. Monroe placed a had on his stomach and felt around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just have a large meal? Your stomach is...quite firm.\" she said.  \"No, I'm going to after this, though. I'm starving.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor probed over his stomach and looked at the monitor.  \"Oh my word...\" she said, her mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, doc?\" he said sarcastically.  \"Triplets. You're five months pregnant with triplets!\" she exclaimed.  \"There we go, doc's getting in on the jokes now!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid I'm serious.\" she turned the monitor towards him. Sure enough, there were three fetuses on the screen.  \"Wh-what the fuck? HOW?!?\" he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I knew I would tell you.  I have the feeling that you're not the only man who's pregnant in this town.\" she said.  Gary was speechless.  He got off of the table and sat down, sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\" she asked.  \"I guess I'll go.\" Pamela said quietly.  Like Gary, she heaved herself on the examination table and lifted up her shirt.  Dr. Monroe began the examination.  \"Hmm. You're five months along too. But...it's quadruplets.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.  How am I gonna take care of four babies on my own?\" Pamela asked, tears streaming down her face.  Nobody responded.  Pamela and Maria traded their places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five months.  Five babies.\" the doctor said.  Maria nodded, rubbing her belly.  \"Okay, Lindsay.  Do you want me to check you out again?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be best.\" Lindsay said.  \"Alright, I'm starving. I'm gonna call a cab and get something to eat. Anyone else wanna come?\" Gary asked.  Four stomachs growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come.\" Pamela said.  \"Me too.\" Maria added.  The three left the office in relative silence.  \"I'll stick around.\" Amy said.  Lindsay was helped onto the table and the doctor began to move the probe across her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you...bigger since yesterday?\" Dr. Monroe asked.  \"I think so.\" Lindsay said, rubbing the sides of her stomach as the babies kicked strongly, demanding food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what's been going on.  I've gotten more pregnant patients in the past few days than I have in the past two months.  And they've all had multiples, too.  Kacy's having octuplets, the poor girl. She was so tiny, I think she might burst.\" she said, continuing the examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are still eight in there.  But now you're a little over six months pregnant. I must have made a mistake yesterday.  But...when did you say you started to feel strange?\" the doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunday.  Six days ago.\"  Lindsay replied.  \"Somehow, someway...you're progressing a month of pregnancy in a day.\" she said.  \"So I'm experiencing a nine day pregnancy? How is that possible?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.  I'll do some research on it.  That means you'll give birth on--\" the doctor began.  \"Tuesday...\" Amy finished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I want you to stop by every day. I want to keep track of this pregnancy, and with multiples...I mean they've been perfectly healthy if not a little large, but there's always a chance you give birth early.  Come back tomorrow at 5, okay?\" she asked.  \"Yeah, okay.\" Lindsay said as she was helped up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took Lindsay home.  \"Octuplets, Lindsay?  There are...eight babies in there?\" Amy asked as she looked over at her friend's belly.  \"Uh-huh.\" she said.  \"But how? Were you taking fertility drugs or something? Was Carl?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Trust me, we were done trying. This is impossible.  I feel like I'm in a nightmare.\" Lindsay groaned.  \"Well, I'm here for you.  Maybe tomorrow morning we can meet up at the cafe and talk about it.\" Amy offered.  \"Yeah, that sounds good.\" Lindsay replied.  She thanked her for the ride as Amy dropped her off in the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay walked towards the house, her hands on her back.  There was another car parked in the driveway, which only meant that Carl's parents were there.  Before she reached the front door, Carl came outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, honey.  How was the field trip?\" he asked, hugging his pregnant wife.  \"I'm six months pregnant with octuplets and I was chasing kids around all day. Take a guess.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.  Wait, six months?\" Carl asked.  \"I'll tell you about it later, alright?  So they're here?  You told them, right?\" Lindsay asked.  \"You see, no.  I just didn't know how to break it to them.  Sorry.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess they'll find out now.\" Lindsay sighed as they entered the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay steeled herself to face her in-laws.  She felt ridiculous doing so and really wished Carl had told them.  She, and nobody else for that matter, ever had any problem with Jonathan, but Carl's mom Cynthia had always been constantly adversarial towards her.  To his credit, Carl had always stood up for her to his mom, but thought he did in a more exasperated rather than angry way.  And now she would have to deal with what criticisms and insults Cynthia could come up with for this situation after what had already been a rough day.  She waddled through the door deeply wishing she didn't have to waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Dad,\" she said, and then, as per Cynthia's request and both of their mutual dislike for each other, \"Hi, Cynthia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horseshoe crab!\" Jonathan said excitedly, writing in his newspaper crossword before standing up to Lindsay and Carl with a big smile on his face, \"Well, what's this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad, we have some, uh, news,\" Carl said, putting an arm around Lindsay.  Lindsay rubbed her belly nervously. A few kicks rippled across its surface, causing her to release a small moan she couldn't suppress fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia stood up slowly looking confused.  \"Are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is!\" Jonathan said stepping forward to hug his daughter-in-law.  Lindsay reciprocated gladly, even though hugging anyone was getting more difficult every day.  \"Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant at your age? What are you thinking?\" was the first jab that Cynthia could settle on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm pregnant.  And we're not that old, it's perfectly fine at our age,\" Lindsay said, glad to see Jonathan was on their side of the room.  She felt better in this face off with Cynthia that she didn't quite so helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how many are you having? When are you due?\" Cynthia asked.  She was standing now with her hands on her hips.  Like Lindsay, she was a short, slim woman.  Lindsay was glad to see that at least, after all these years, his mother-in-law looked like she had finally gained some weight.  She actually looked bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's six mo-\" Carl started to say before Lindsay interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously,\" Cynthia said as she walked over looking Lindsay up and now, \"Well,\" she said, clearly straining for something to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for you, too, I know how you've been trying,\" Jonathan said, oblivious that they had both long ago given up trying to have children.  \"And grandchildren! I'm as pleased as, as . . . Abe Lincoln when he wrote the Gettysburg Address,\" Jonathan suddenly grabbed his paper and jotted down one of those words in his crossword, then looked back up thoughtfully, \"Although I suppose that was actually probably more depressing for him, thinking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're eating healthy for the baby, at least,\" Cynthia said, glaring at Lindsay's enormous belly, \"It's not healthy to gain too much weight when you're pregnant and you look huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mom,\" Carl snapped, \"Just be happy for us. Sure, it's unexpected, but you know what? We both wanted this.\"  Lindsay thought that there was some sincerity to what Carl said, which was a lot different than the panic both of them had when they found out.  If Lindsay was no closer to accepting this, she now got the impression Carl was actually getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice to the kids, Cynthia, you always said you wanted grandchildren.  So how many are in there?\" Jonathan said, still beaming and, Lindsay thought very thankfully, not obtrusively grabbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously more than one,\" Cynthia said, her glare softening but still not smiling.  She patted Lindsay's belly.  A loud groan and some turmoil erupted.  Lindsay brushed and stepped back, but Cynthia patted it a few more times for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight,\" Lindsay said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight!\" the both repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you're so big,\" Cynthia said.  She must be loving at least that part, Lindsay thought, flashing back to all the needless comments about how she would gain weight if she ate this and that despite never happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am exactly the right size for how many I'm carrying and haven't gained any unnecessary weight at all,\" Lindsay said, wishing she could mention that her mother-in-law was getting a belly herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there, you must be exhausted,\" Jonathan said, ushering in his daughter-in-law into the room to sit down.  Him being such a nice guy didn't completely make up for Cynthia, but it helped.  \"And don't try to stop us from waiting on you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay saw Carl and his dad exchanged some fatherly, sonly looks of affection while Cynthia stood off to the side sulking.  Lindsay was more than happy to be off her feet.  She sank into the couch while Carl and Jonathan went to the kitchen.  Lindsay turned to her mother-in-law who was still looking her up and down.  Lindsay's eyes settled on Cynthia's bloated middle.  She must have noticed, as she awkwardly moved a hand over it and shifted her stance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay's feet were so sore now that she gave up trying to look defiant in front of Cynthia and sat down.  Carl was shaking hands with his dad after both had attempted an awkward hug. Lindsay would have been happy for both of them had she not felt so awful herself.  Jonathan always wanted to be a grandfather, although Cynthia was irrationally opposed to the idea.  Now, she was sitting next to Lindsay staring with distaste at enormous belly while she had her hands on her lap apparently trying to hide her own recent gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you two gave up on kids?\" she said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes these things just happen,\" Lindsay said, just as cooly, and felt a rush of panic at her own words.  <i>Just happen,</i> she repeated, reminding herself how inexplicable and rapid her pregnancy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you must have been taking fertility pills,\" Cynthia said as if the idea was absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't. It just . . . happened,\" Lindsay rubbed her sore belly, not even bothering pulling it down over the lower part that was exposed.  That soothed the inner movements somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Cynthia said dismissively. The blood rushed to Lindsay's face. She wanted to strike back but Carl and Jonathan were now standing in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's say we let the ladies rest and we'll take care of dinner tonight,\" Jonathan said, still with a broad smile on his face. Lindsay sometimes couldn't believe how this man ever got with that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" Lindsay said, genuinely grateful.  She didn't even have to explain how much it meant to not have to be standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay lay her head back and closed her eyes.  Cynthia made a few disapproving \"mmhps!\" sounds, but did not try to strike up a conversation.  Dinner was served some time later, a homemade lasagna recipe that Cynthia made for Carl growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to help at all?\" Cynthia said to Lindsay as the first whiffs of the finished meal wafted into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay glared.  Cynthia had always said Carl was a better cook and more than once suggested that Lindsay just let Carl handle dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I can help much?\" Lindsay spread her arms over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cooked all through when I was expecting Carl. But then I wasn't nearly as big as you,\" Cynthia smiled, quite insincerely, and patted Lindsay's belly.  It gurgled, and some bumps moved across the surface.  Lindsay winced. \"No, not nearly-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner time!\" the door to the kitchen swung open.  Jonathan was still as joyful as before, while Carl looked uncomfortable.  He did not want to leave his wife alone with his mom.  In fact, he didn't really like to spend time alone with her himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you up there, Lindsay,\" Jonathan said as he and Carl approached Lindsay.  Cynthia stood up and stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare, you'll throw out your back,\" and then added, as if to make the point more obvious, \"She's too heavy for you to lift so I hope Carl can on his own.\" Her expression said she doubted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay would have given anything to have her old body back right now so she could spring up and stare her mother-in-law down.  But she couldn't.  Standing was getting harder every day.  Now, if she rocked herself hard enough she might be able to get to her knees off the chair.  Carl grabbed her hands and hoisted her upward.  They both nearly fell down with Lindsay taking half a minute to steady herself.  She was blushing now, avoiding Cynthia's victorious look.  As much as she said obviously disapproved of them having children, she must be immensely enjoying seeing the trim Lindsay so huge and ungainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl, ever the good host to dinner guests, passed out the plates he gave an extra helping to Lindsay. This prompted Cynthia to just flat out ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much weight have you gained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, give her a break, she's pregnant,\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's important to keep track,\" Cynthia said, \"It's not good for the babies to gain too much.  And the more you gain, the harder it is to get your figure back. I was lucky, but then I was much, much smaller-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all belly, Cynthia,\" Lindsay said, pointing out how far from the table she had to sit, \"My doctor says I'm healthy and she's the expert, not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her, she's just jealous because she blew up with Carl,\" Jonathan said with a chuckle, \"Took her a year to get back into shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that,\" Cynthia said, digging in.  She wasn't eating as fast, or as much as Lindsay, but Lindsay couldn't help but notice her normally dainty mother-in-law was really packing it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That would explain the gut,</i> Lindsay thought with some pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was in full blown eating mode now, and she still had trouble wrapping her head around it. She was slowly accepting that she would get bigger every day.  She was even starting to accept that her body would be completely out of control for the foreseeable future. But she just couldn't comprehend how she, a careful eater all her life, could stuff herself so mechanically, so fully, until every square inch of her stomach must be packed with food.  It felt like her hands were taking command entirely from the hunger part of her brain and wouldn't stop until she had been efficiently stuffed.  She was briefly pulled out of her eating, just when her fantastically stuffed belly somehow felt fuller, and more tight, than ever before, by her mother-in-law very uncharacteristically belching while, Lindsay saw, holding her own swollen midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\". . . and how are you going to care for eight kids on just a teacher's salary?\" Lindsay heard Cynthia saying to Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you don't even know how much money I make, do you? Trust me, paying for the kids is the least of my worries.\"  Cynthia had trouble remembering Carl had a very well-paying job, and often would rub Cynthia's less lucrative career in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she going to have time to teach with so many children?\" Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing first, Lindsay said, \"I'm right here, Cynthia.  And yes, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Lindsay's tone was enough to keep Cynthia in line for the rest of the meal.  That, and she seemed as eager to eat as much as possible as Lindsay was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're in the guest room,\" Carl said, walking into the bedroom to find Lindsay lying on her side, her whole body tilting the bed in her direction and her belly sticking off the side of the mattress.  He sat next to her and put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" he said softly. He was going to tell Lindsay how it was starting to hit him that they would finally be parents, that after giving up so long ago they could do what they had wanted so much to do.  But Lindsay wouldn't even let him start.  She was fuming from Cynthia's barrage the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did you invite them over?\" Lindsay said, turning around as much as she could.  Carl almost jumped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, and hey, they'll be gone and she'll come around and you should just relax,\" which, nobody how gently Carl said it, was not something you say to somebody who did not want to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm irritated, and everything hurts, and I look and feel like a disgusting blob, and you have to have your mother over who you know is only going to make everything worse,\" Lindsay wasn't exactly yelling, but it was clear she would be if she could work up the breath to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, okay?\" Carl said, getting frustrated himself, \"But they're my parents, what am I going to say to them? And they had to find out sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me sleep and you deal with them tomorrow,\" Lindsay turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was trying to be as understanding he could.  He felt that while Lindsay was getting it the worst, this was still a situation that he had to adjust to, too, and that she was picking a fight out of her own frustration.  But he didn't respond.  Annoyed and feeling unappreciated, Carl turned off the lights and tried to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsay didn't think she slept more than a few minutes at a time.  Every time she thought sleep was coming one little movement in her belly would set off a flurry of kicks.  They were getting worse, stronger, bordering on painful.  It stretched her already overstretched skin with each movement and pressed into her cramped insides.  She simultaneously felt like she would burst from the pressure and sink through the bed from the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow she did sleep, since she obviously woke up.  She was on her side, as sleeping her back made her spine feel like it would snap in half.  Her belly, enormous, round, gurgling with hunger, stuck off the bed.  She sighed, looking past her painfully bloated breasts, at the enormous thing that took up most of her figure now.  She tried to sit up.  The key word being \"try.\"  She grunted and pulled, feeling her muscles in her sides tearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl?\" she craned her neck.  Carl had woken up, probably hours ago.  It was light outside.  The clock on her end table read that it was almost noon.  No wonder she was so hungry.  Lindsay was glad it was the weekend.  After the week she just had she dreaded another day of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl!\" she yelled this time.  Deliberately, she heard Carl coming up the stairs.  He had a tray of waffles and good pile of bacon.  She could smell it all the way from her kitchen.  Her belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's expression and tone showed he was still annoyed with her, which worked out since she was still upset with him.  It infuriated her that he was talking this situation up to his parents like it was some glorious miracle rather than the nightmare that it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help here?\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.  Right,\" Carl said, his face softening.  He put the food down on his end table.  He rounded the bed and grabbed his wife's slender arms and pulled.  She barely budged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder!\" Lindsay said.  The movement caused her belly to wobble dangerously.  They had gotten her in a sitting position and now Carl braced himself to pull her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes . . .\" Carl pulled as hard as he could.  Lindsay lifted to her feet, her belly pulled forward, feeling like it would just keep pulling until she fell on her face.  She spread her legs, her hips creaking as her body settled solidly.  She wrapped her arms around her sides, noticing that she couldn't even reach all the way around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl had fallen backwards with a sharp cry.  Lindsay, lost in her own thoughts and still angry, now noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" she said, taking an awkward step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, I think I threw my back out,\" he said, barely disguising his annoyance.  He latched onto the bathroom door handle to pull himself up, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, definitely out,\" he said, holding his back and walking to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay almost apologized, except that the look in Carl's glance at her showed all too well exactly what he was thinking.  His eyes traveled up and down his unbelievably pregnant wife.  Lindsay put her hands on her hips and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I'm so hard to help up,\" she said, then added for good measure, \"Why don't you just go downstairs to to your parents and leave your fat wife alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Lindsay, I'm in pain here,\" Carl said holding his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think <i>this</i> is painful?\" Lindsay said, spreading her arms around her bloated torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl yelped again as he tried and failed to lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go, leave me alone,\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, Jesus,\" Carl muttered.  Lindsay couldn't wait to get to her breakfast but wanted to continue to glare at Carl as he left.  Once gone, she inhaled her food in minutes, and still her stomach was begging for more.</span></div></div>",

She looked in the mirror, then looked at the clothes. Her stomach as absolutely enormous now. There was no way it would fit. With a sigh, she grabbed some sweatpants and a tank top and squeezed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay cautiously made her way down the stairs and waddled towards the kitchen.  Inside, Jonathan and Cynthia were sitting at the kitchen table, while Carl was propped up against the refrigerator with an ice pack on his back. She noticed that Jonathan and Cynthia were still in their pajamas. Apparently it was a lazy day for everyone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl saw Lindsay approach. \"Uh, I think I'm gonna go upstairs and lie down. Rest my back a little bit.\" he said, awkwardly walking past Lindsay. He grazed against her stomach as he tried to sidle past her and huffed.  Lindsay glared at him as he made his way upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked at her in-laws. Jonathan was buried in a newspaper while Cynthia was staring intently at her with a look of wonder and bemusement.  \"Come take a seat.\" she said. Lindsay obliged, and approached the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. This article says that there's been a spike in pregnancies with multiples in the area. Seems a little hard to believe.\" Jonathan said, mainly to himself.  \"Hard to believe? Have you seen your son's wife? No offense.\" Cynthia said, flashing the world's most fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Lindsay slowly sat down and the chair creaked. Cynthia scoffed at her, which caused Lindsay to send her a glare. Apart from Jonathan flipping the pages of the newspaper, the room was silent until a stomach rumbled. Jonathan looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you something to eat, Lindsay?\" Jonathan asked, putting his paper down. \"That wasn't me.\" Lindsay replied.  Jonathan looked at his wife. \"Cynthia?\" he asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a light breakfast, okay? It's fine, I can make something myself. You don't have to wait on me hand an foot.\" she said. She turned and stood up. Lindsay was shocked when she saw her mother in law's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was round and jutting out, her shirt revealing a decent amount of her belly.  She appeared to be as big as Lindsay was a few days ago. Cynthia had one hand on her stomach as she perused the pantry. Lindsay looked on in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Cynthia, are you feeling alright?\" Lindsay asked, her jaw agape.  \"Just peachy. Why do you ask?\" Cynthia replied.  \"Well, it's just that you've sorta gotten...you know...round around the middle?\" Lindsay implied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia frowned.  \"I'll have you know that I'm--\" \"PREGNANT!\" Jonathan blurted out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay and Cynthia looked at him. Jonathan glanced up from his paper.  \"Sorry, I'm just filling out a crossword puzzle here, and the answer was a type of pause.  What were you two talking about?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Go back to your crossword puzzle, Jonathan.\" Cynthia spat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at Lindsay.  \"I'm just retaining some water, that's all. And I suppose that I've been eating a little more than normal, but that's to be expected when you're around someone with...such a gluttonous appetite such as yourself.  So what's on schedule for today for you, Lindsay?\" she asked, changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to meet one of my friends in a little bit, then I guess I have another appointment.\" Lindsay said.  \"Have you gotten anything for the babies?\" Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. This whole thing kinda...sprung up on us.\" she said.  \"Well how about we go to the mall later today to get that settled? We could also come along to your appointment.\" Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I guess...\" Lindsay said.  She heard a car honk outside.  \"That's my friend. I guess I should get going.\" Lindsay said, struggling to standing up.  \"Have fun.\" Cynthia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cafe, Amy and Lindsay were eating lunch. Of course, the two pregnant women were eating quite a large amount of food.  \"So...you've definitely grown, right?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay looked down at her monstrous stomach.  \"Yeah. I think that the nine days theory that doctor had was correct.\" Lindsay said, wincing as the babies were starting to get particularly active.  \"How is that possible, though? I mean, that SHOULD be impossible, right?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought me GETTING pregnant would be impossible. I don't think anything about this can surprise me anymore.\" Lindsay said.  \"You know, Lindsay, I'm actually getting kinda worried about you.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lindsay inquired.  \"I guess I mean that you're getting really big really fast. I'm just worried that you'll explode or something.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be fine. But I definitely feel more and more pressure as I get bigger. Especially when they're all kicking. Eugh, like they're doing now.\" she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked on with concern as Lindsay writhed in her chair.  Amy approached her and began to rub her friend's massive stomach.  \"Does that help at all?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah a little bit.\" Lindsay replied, breathing heavily.  The two continued their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Lindsay?\" Amy asked.  \"What do you mean?\" Lindsay asked.  \"Something's on your mind. Something's bothering you. What is it?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl and I have been getting into a lot of arguments lately.  I don't know. I just feel like we're drifting apart.\" she said.  \"Well, pregnancies can be stressful. For the person going through it and the father. I  know that you've been struggling with it, but I can't even imagine how Carl's taking it. It happens. But in a  few days you'll be welcoming a bunch of bundles of joy into the world and you'll forget all about it.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Lindsay replied.  \"It'll be fine. If you need someone to talk to, you know that I'm always available.\" Amy smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Amy.  You're the best friend a woman seven months pregnant with octuplets could ask for.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Across town, Principal Maria Donner awoke as she had the last few days-larger and heavier. She was smaller than Lindsay, thank god, but her enormous belly still dominated her figure. Walking had started getting harder for her two days ago. Now standing was a chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a young woman Maria had been tall and svelte, a beautiful, dark-haired woman who if not for her professional attire would have looked more like a model than a teacher. She had aged gracefully, gaining weight but mostly in her hips and breasts, and had entered her 40s as a boxum and gorgeous if serious woman.  Now in her early 50s, her age was starting to show.  Her breasts were less firm. Her stomach's softness was turning to paunchiness.  Her face grew lines which put her clearly in the camp of older attractive woman. She felt much more at home in her body like this than the slim young woman she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then this pregnancy happened. Never mind that she was going to be a mother in a few days time. Or that this had popped up out of nowhere. The strangest thing wasn't that she felt very little panic to begin with, but now old, unfamiliar emotions started growing in her as quickly as her belly grew. More and more throughout the days she found herself rubbing her belly, staring at it, examining herself in mirrors. She stood before one now in a tank top that rode up so far her entire round orb of a belly was visible. Despite herself she actually felt sexy for the first time in years. The ungainly walk she was developing didn't strike her as awkward is it must to so many others in town. Instead, she somehow felt graceful as she pushed her giant belly forward, her wide hips following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria didn't understand why she felt like this about what to most everybody else must seem like a nightmare. She only knew it was getting harder to maintain her composure around others. The need to keep her hands on her belly, to expose it for everyone to see, were growing stronger each day. Fabric chafed her sore, bloated midsection and she dreaded having to cover it with bigger and bigger clothes.  Fortunately, today was Saturday, and she intended to stay indoors, wear what she wanted, and eat everything she could get her hands on to feed her always hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gradually dawning on Maria that she wasn't merely intrigued by her changing body, but by the lives growing within her. After all these years of not giving the matter much thought, Maria was going to be a mother, and the idea excited more than she could ever have thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were ups and downs at first, but within by the end of the day after finding out he was pregnant Gary had made peace with the idea. He was always someone who adjusted fast. It frankly worried his wife that he was taking this situation in stride. A pregnant man? It was impossible. And being parents at their age? Well, not impossible, but they were at the late stage where making that decision was now or never, and it looked like it was going to be now and a very soon now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat helped Gary the most, aside from his natural disposition to taking things as they came, was realizing that not just plenty of women but plenty of men in town were going through the same thing. Even if it was clearly not normal it made him feel like less of an anomaly.  He was glad it was Saturday, though. It was getting hard to wear decent clothes at work. Lindsay with her giant belly might get away with showing some midriff now but Gary imagined it wouldn't look quite so usual on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out over his yard wearing an open rode and sweatpants, his belly sticking out well over a foot in front of him. He had to constantly hold his back when he walked. He already had a bad back, and high blood pressure, and so the doctor warned him to take it easy. She did tell him he was quite healthy, though, and the babies were too. Gary nodded to himself and allowed his hand to massage the vast expanse of his belly without shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the back porch door next door open and walked over to the fence. Their neighbors were a young, attractive couple. He knew the wife, Melanie, was rapidly pregnant and had become a hermit lately. However, he was unaware until now that the husband, a good-looking, toned electrician named Luke, was also expecting. He almost smiled in surprise as he saw him in a shirt too small and in shorts that were pushed down far enough to be almost falling off by his belly. On Gary it looked like an out of control beer belly, but on Luke it was obvious he was very pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, neighbor!\" Gary said, waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked over. After considering for a moment, his expression lightened and he waddled over to Gary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So . . . you too, huh?\" Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary shrugged, \"What can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shrugged back. After some awkward small talk, the two eventually sat together and continued to discuss things that were absolutely not pregnancy related, while avoiding staring at each others impressively round stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lindsay, the situation was an endless stream of frustrations. For Pamela, it was like a wonderful reawakening. Gary, he just did his best to accept it. But Pamela found nothing remotely acceptable about becoming suddenly very pregnant. Her initial reaction was much like her ex-boyfriends-they were not ready to be parents. Pamela could teach kids and care for them a little, but had no confidence in her ability to do so full time. She barely even had an interest in it. She couldn't imagine where in her apartment she would even keep a baby, let alone multiple ones. She couldn't imagine herself getting out of bed at 3:00 in the morning to feed or comfort them, and the idea would have been annoying to her had every part of this situation terrified her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela was always an assuming person who hated calling attention to herself. She was pretty and petite, and could with little effort look very beautiful, but intentionally dressed and carried herself to be as unobtrusive as possible. Now, and this made her resent the lives growing inside her so much that it only reinforced her feelings of being unqualified for motherhood, she couldn't help but be noticed. Her body had gone through what was to her a horrible transformation in the last few days. While initial her little bulge of a belly looked like it would shape into a normal pregnant shape as the others, by the end of the second day, before she even knew she was pregnant, she was filling out all over. Her thighs and hips were suddenly crammed into her work pants. Her tiny ass grew rounder and began jiggling with each step. Her barely existent breasts blew up overnight. Her cheeks ballooned out, her neck joined in, giving her a comically bloated face so that she couldn't even recognize herself. She didn't look at all pregnant, she thought. She just looked fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't fair. Lindsay might have the bigger belly but the rest of her remained as thin as always. Even Maria's weight was evenly distributed. But Pamela just turned round. She had taken her small body for granted and now missed it, hating every new change that happened to her. The babies kicking inside her felt more like enormous gas bubbles from her daily feasts. She was almost glad her boyfriend left before she was looked like this. She dreaded the thought of what would happen after she gave birth. She would be a desperate, incompetent mother and a fat one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these depressing thoughts did not prevent Pamela from spending her first two hours of the Saturday stuffing her face on the couch, until even the oversized clothes she had bought could no longer fully contain her girth. Her hands rested on her stomach, sinking into the hateful flab rather than the taut dome such as Lindsay had developed. Deep inside her, movements rocked her body. She winced, moaning, but didn't know what else to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl and Jonathan did most of the talking while the four walked around the department store. Carl's earlier bad mood had lightened due mostly to Jonathan's enthusiasm. Lindsay also noticed that while his back was still hurting him, he was trying to hide it rather than play it up, which was one subtle step towards making up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can probably put one of these together in an hour,\" Jonathan said. They were looking at cribs now. It struck Lindsay as terribly stereotypical, but she realized they would have to get some baby supplies very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" she cooed suddenly, planting her hands on her belly. They were acting up again, the bumps and movements visible through her overburdened maternity dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsay?\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just they're kicking again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia, who had been mostly silent the entire trip, made a sort of \"hmmph\" sound. She rubbed her own belly. It had visibly grown and her clothing was growing tight. She kept having to pull down her already straining blouse. Lindsay thought her son and husband must be oblivious to what was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lindsay knew it a young woman in slacks and a polo shirt was speaking with Carl and Jonathan. While slim, Lindsay saw the telltale sign of recent change she had seen in so many this last week.  This girl, barely 19 by the looks of it, had a rounded, puffy tummy that she was doing her best to be comfortable with. <i>If she thinks it's bad now, wait a few days,</i> Lindsay thought as the girl continually tried to keep her hands away from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" . . . so how many are you going to be needing?\" the young woman asked Carl, glancing at Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, eight,\" Carl said. Lindsay felt a strange twinge of some kind of pride at the response that she couldn't quite explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, you'll have your hands full,\" the girl laughed, her hand once again going to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about yourself, miss?\" Jonathan asked good naturedly. The girl's face fell as she spread her hands over her stomach, then crossed her arms to stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not, um . . .\" seeing the awkwardness of having to tell customers she was not in fact pregnant, she quickly changed the subject, \"Say, I'll bet we can get you a bulk discount!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Carl and Jonathan, who both had the same eye for a deal, said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce those three had walked off, Lindsay lowered herself onto a bench with a loud \"oof!\"  She looked around. So many women in various stages of pregnancy wandered around. Even though this was a store for baby supplies, it struck her that it must be much fuller. She thought about the poor girl who must be experiencing this, too, but didn't know it. She would be in for a rude awakening come tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose these cribs are fine,\" Cynthia said, rocking the one they were looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay glared at her. Cynthia only ever acted cordial to lure her into another insult. Any response she had would have a come back ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to see a doctor, Cynthia,\" Lindsay said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia blushed, \"I have my regular check ups. If you're insinuating that I've put on weight, I assure you that's normal for a woman my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay rolled her eyes, then closed them as another wave of motion hit her hard. She rubbed her massive sides and moaned while laying her head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks very uncomfortable,\" Cynthia said with a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lindsay could respond Jonathan was walking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lindsay, you think these are the ones? Good price, study build, not going to tip over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan helped Lindsay up, which took a moment. Lindsay lumbered to the crib and bumped it with her belly. It rocked a little. Despite herself, she laughed. It was the first time she had found anything remotely amusing about her current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they'll do fine,\" she said, giving her father-in-law a tired smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl returned moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll deliver them later today,\" he said, putting a hand on Lindsay's shoulder. She nudged towards him as much as she could without falling over. \"So, I was talking with Dad and we're thinking the den upstairs should be moved downstairs, and we'll turn the office next to us into the baby room. It's big enough and right by our bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two can fix it up I'm for it,\" Lindsay said, thankful that she did not have to extend any thought or effort into this part of the preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can. I built near half our house before Carl was born,\" Jonathan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds wonderful,\" Lindsay said, and she smiled at Carl. He smiled back. Their politeness to each other felt forced, but Lindsay was glad that neither of them were itching to fight the other now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to next, ladies?\" Jonathan asked.</span></div></div>",

Forgot about that.\" Carl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  I guess I can wait a little longer to eat...\" Cynthia said. Her grumbling stomach said otherwise, as she placed a hand on her rounding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four made their way out of the mall as Lindsay lagged behind, of course.  Carl noticed this, and dropped back to walk with her.  He wrapped his arm around her back, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doing?\" he asked.  \"I'm as big as a house, I can barely walk, and it feels like these babies are gonna kick their way out of me.  How does it feel being married to a whale?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on.  You're the prettiest whale I've ever seen.\" Carl smiled.  Lindsay just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Dr. Monroe's office, Lindsay approached the front desk.  \"Hi, Lindsay.  More ultrasounds today?\" Kacy asked, staring at Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay looked back to Cynthia, whose nose was turned up.  \"No. Just for me.\" Lindsay replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll take you to the doctor.\" Kacy said.  She attempted to get up, but was having difficulty due to the size of her belly, which had continued to grow. Now, she was slightly smaller than Lindsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help?\" Jonathan asked.  \"No...I've got it.\" she grunted.  After a few more attempts, she was able to get up. Kacy wobbled slightly, trying to find her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKacy lead them down the hallway to the examination room.  \"So...how far along are you?\" Lindsay asked, wincing as her babies unleashed some particularly strong kicks to her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 months.  Or days...I guess.\"  Kacy replied.  \"What?\" Cynthia asked.  Before anyone could reply, they had arrived to their destination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the examination room, Dr. Monroe was turning on the ultrasound machine.  \"Hey, doctor.\" Lindsay said, clutching her monstrous midsection. The doctor turned around, eyes bulging as she saw how big Lindsay was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good afternoon, Lindsay.\" she stuttered.  \"These are my in-laws, Jonathan and Cynthia.\" Lindsay said. They greeted each other and shook hands, as Dr. Monroe's eyes diverted to Cynthia's pregnant-looking belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you both. Are you excited to be grandparents?\" the doctor asked.  \"Absolutely!\" Jonathan beamed. \"Yes.\" Cynthia said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was helped onto the table, as Dr. Monroe lifted the pregnant teacher's shirt up.  \"The babies sure seem a lot more active today...\" the doctor noted as waves of movement rippled across Lindsay's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're definitely getting stronger. Feels like there's a fight club in my stomach sometimes.\"  Lindsay groaned.  \"Well, at least you only have a few days left.\" Dr. Monroe said, squirting gel onto Lindsay's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor began the sonogram, moving the probe across Lindsay's vast midsection.  \"Well, I think we were right about our nine day theory. Seems like you're on track to give birth on Tuesday.\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem like there's much more room for these babies, does it? Hopefully you won't burst by then.\" Cynthia snickered.  Lindsay grew red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same thing to you...fatty.\" she spat.  Cynthia cackled in response.  \"Ma'am, are you sure you don't want me to examine you?\" Dr. Monroe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please.  I just had a checkup two weeks ago.  It's just some weight from over eating and water retention.\" Cynthia muttered, crossing her arms over her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then. Lindsay, before I forget. I'm leaving town later tonight for a conference to talk about these...rapid pregnancies that have been going on. Of course that means that I won't be present for the rest of your pregnancy. Kacy will conduct your examinations from here on out.\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kacy? Not that I think she wouldnt 't a good job filling in, but will she be able to move around going forward?\" Lindsay asked.  The doctor pondered this idea for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll be fine. If you need anything call me or Kacy.\" she said.  Lindsay nodded, and the four returned to their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's for dinner?\" Carl asked his wife and mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza.\" \"Chinese.\" Cynthia and Lindsay uttered at the same time.</span></div></div>",

I really don't know how much more I can take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be much longer,\" Carl said as they pulled into the drive way. Lindsay bristled at the comment. Even another day like this, and with more growing to go, would be a nightmare. Carl reached over and rubbed her belly as he put the car in park. His hand looked miniature on her midsection. Lindsay glared and brushed him off as he started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that,\" she snapped. Carl complied and went around to help her out. As usual, getting Lindsay to her feet was a complicated process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for some variety,\" Jonathan said to his son, \"Let's say we make both our ladies happy. Pizza and Chinese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll hit the spot,\" Carl said, \"That okay, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay nodded, out of breath before they even reached the door. When she walked now it felt like her belly was trying to pull her down and drag her back at the same time. Her whole body felt vestigial to, her skinny legs just a means to sometimes move, and her slender arms to feed it whenever it demanded. She was going through repeated variations of these thoughts as Cynthia chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why we need to get so much food, it's only four of us,\" Cynthia said, then looked knowingly at Lindsay, \"Or is that twelve now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's twelve,\" Carl smiled, patting Lindsay belly again. It rumbled and churned. Lindsay fumed.  Once inside, Jonathan went to the fridge to find local places to order some while Cynthia rushed to the bathroom. Lindsay turned on Carl and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop touching my stomach. I already feel like a bloated freak so I don't need you reminding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey-\" Carl said gently, some annoyance creeping into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fun for me,\" Lindsay said, controlling herself to not blow up any more. She waddled slowly away, muttering, \"I just want it to be over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan could be heard calling for pizza, then Chinese. He ordered a good variety to be on the safe side. Lindsay settled into a chair to get as comfortable as she could. It barely helped, although being off her feet were nice. She felt trapped under a colossal belly now. Looking down over herself she saw just how big her breasts were getting too. Swollen with milk, she thought. She would need more clothes tomorrow. She was going to outgrow this outfit by the end of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite a meal for you, Lindsay,\" Cynthia said looking over the food as Jonathan and Carl set up around the coffee table in the living room for an informal meal. Lindsay glared, knowing that she would pack quite a lot of this away herself. \"Does your doctor think it's normal to gain so much weight at this stage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says I'm fine,\" Lindsay said, \"And you're one to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked up set and touched her stomach, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" Jonathan said, patting his daughter-in-law's shoulder as he handed her a plate packed high with Chinese food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia was already chowing down, her stomach's rumbling could be heard across the room. Jonathan and Carl looked like they were on a diet compared to how their wives' were eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was pregnant with Carl it took two years to lose the weight. Of course I was a lot younger,\" Cynthia said. Lindsay couldn't respond right away, her mouth being full. She gently pressed her stomach to settle it. Blushing as she did so, Lindsay stifled a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll be fine, it's perfectly normal for a first time mother in her late 30s to become plump,\" Cynthia smiled sadistically at Lindsay, who felt more furious and trapped than she had all night. She would have given anything to be able to stand in a huff and haughtily leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, come on,\" Carl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't mind if your wife as a little plump, would you, Carl?\" Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl opened his mouth to say \"of course not\" defensively, then realized that might be the wrong thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll get used to it,\" Cynthia said, \"being plump-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying that,\" Lindsay said. She had stopped eating now and was holding her enormous belly in both hands, rocking back and forth, trying to stand. Cynthia started to speak again when Carl stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a massive effort that nearly pulled every muscle in her legs and back, Lindsay actually stood up. She almost fell right back down, but she managed to remain standing, wobbling, with her legs spread wide and her hands protectively holding her sides. She started to storm out, aware that she must look like a pathetic, slow-moving cow rather than the beautiful, indignant woman she knew she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, mom,\" Carl said, going after Lindsay, who had made it to the foyer. Behind them, they could hear Jonathan's polite voice reprimanding Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone,\" Lindsay said, barely holding back screaming. She didn't know if she wanted to fight or cry. \"Just leave me alone, okay?\" she said, sadly now. Carl put up his hands and backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm leaving you alone. I'll be hear when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay barely heard him. Once Carl left, she grabbed her purse and awkwardly walked outside. It's a good thing they didn't have steps out front or she certainly would have fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay felt helpless and angry. She had no idea what she was going to do. She could hardly go for a walk, she'd be winded by the end of the drive way. But what else was there? She wasn't going back in there with her mother-in-law. She couldn't believe Carl was so calm in talking back to her. If her parents acted like that to him she'd never speak to them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" she said, slouching forward a little. They were acting up again. She would have to find something to do some place to go.</span></div></div>",

Amy picked up after a few rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Amy answered, sounding like her mouth was full of food. \"Hey, it's Lindsay. Listen, do you think you could pick me up? And could I maybe stay at your place for a little bit?\" Lindsay asked, her free hand rubbing her belly in an ill-fated attempt to calm her unborn children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...sure. Is there something wrong?\" her friend wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay grunted as a particularly hard kick was sent to her bladder. \"Mmm...I'll tell you when you get here. Could you make it fast, please?\" Lindsay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'm leaving now.\" Amy said, hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay's feet were killing her. She plodded over to the rocking chair that was on the porch and plopped down. It creaked in protest. Lindsay's belly groaned again. Her babies were already hungry even after that feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead pulled up her shirt, revealing her pale dome of a midsection. It glistened with sweat and bulged in multiple places as her babies continued to kick. Luckily, she had gone this far without any stretch marks, which seemed like a miracle. Lindsay thought about what her body would look like after she gave birth, and shuddered. She'd probably still look pregnant. It was hard to believe, but in a matter of days she'd be a mother. It almost seemed impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minivan pulled into the driveway minutes later, and Lindsay knew that it was Amy. She exited the vehicle and waddled over towards her friend. She was clearly surprised by Lindsay's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Jeez, look at you. Any day now, huh?\" she asked. \"Yeah. And it can't come soon enough. A little help here?\" Lindsay requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, Amy was able to get Lindsay off of her feet, and they made their way to Amy's minivan. She got situated and moved her seat back, but her stomach still pressed against the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's going on?\" Amy asked.  \"Carl's parents are driving me crazy. Or at least his mother is. God, she is so insufferable. And Carl's getting on my nerves, too. He keeps rubbing my stomach when I tell him to stop. He refuses to keep Cynthia in check. I need to get away for a little while.\" Lindsay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you really blame Carl? He's going to be a father, and he probably had given up. I mean, aren't you excited?\" Amy asked. \"I'm excited for this to be over. These babies are killing me, Amy. You have no idea what it's like to have eight babies inside of you, fighting for room and for food. It's a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Amy's house minutes later. Inside, they were greeted by Amy's family, who were sitting at the dinner table. In the middle of the table was a huge dish of macaroni and cheese. Lindsay's stomach groaned loudly. Amy's husband, and her three children looked up at Lindsay, obviously amazed at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids, this is Lindsay, my friend. She's going to be staying here for a while, so please be nice. Lindsay, of course you know my husband Owen.\" she said, gesturing to her husband, a handsome man about the same age as Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you, Lindsay.\" he said, trying not to look at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is Arnold, our oldest. He just turned seven.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold waved. Lindsay waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is John. He's five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" he said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, John.\" Lindsay replied. Her feet and back were killing her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we have Billie. She's going to be four next month.\" Amy said, pointing at her daughter, who had short curly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you having a baby?\" Billie asked bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, you know you're not supposed to ask that.\" Amy said.  \"But yes, she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, I'm having eight.\" Lindsay replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen dropped his fork. \"I-I'm sorry, did you say eight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I've got octuplets in here.\" she said, patting her belly. It, of course, growled and shifted in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, take a seat and help yourself. I need to start doing the dishes anyway.\" Owen said, leading Lindsay to his chair. She sat down and began to eat voraciously as Amy's kids looked on in wonder. She ended up licking the tray completely clean, leaving one less dish for Owen to wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsay was pretty exhausted, so Amy led her the guest room. It had a bathroom and a king-sized bed, which was good enough for Lindsay. Amy let Lindsay be, and she got ready for bed. She removed her maternity clothes, leaving Lindsay only in her bra and underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her head hit the pillow, she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Her modest might prevent her from going out, but she could not resist lying on a lawn chair in her backyard as the sun came up. She was in nothing but an ill-fitting bikini that barely contained her engorged breasts and a thong that wasn't much better. She gently rubbed her belly up and down. It was enormous, taking up her entire view when she looked down at it, even surpassing her breasts. She had never felt so sexy, and even rubbing her belly was enough to send her into waves of arousal. She would miss feeling like this, so uninhibited and sexual. It was a far cry from her normal, professional, uptight self. But all good things must come to an end, she told herself. She could relax and enjoy it. There would be no sense going back into work or even thinking about work. Most of the teachers where in the same state as her, and she was willing to bet none of them were appreciating it like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary had gotten used to getting bigger every day and turning into a hugely pregnant man. The part that annoyed him most was that none of his clothes fit anymore, but he made do with just his bathrobe. Although that didn't exactly cover him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out to the back porch, or rather waddled out. At this point his belly was so heavy and large that walking was becoming harder by the hour. He looked over and saw Luke sitting in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey neighbor,\" he said and slowly lowered himself next to him. \"Any day, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. How are you holding up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary leaned back and groaned as a flurry of kicks went through him. \"Not bad, actually. Funny how you get used to things, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Luke said with a nod as the two turned the subject to other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela should have been used to it now. Every morning she had woken up finding it harder to move, finding more parts of her once lithe figure growing plumper and softer. But she didn't. Once again she struggled to put on her sweatpants and an enormous shirt that did not cover her belly, let alone those lovehandles and back fat that had appeared on her once tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least this morning she didn't cry. Although, as usual, seeing her face even fatter, her cheeks so round her mouth was permanently puffed open, gave her a start. She didn't know why she bothered pulling on a shirt that was so tight on her chest and arms and barely covered her belly. But she really didn't want to see any of herself exposed, and hid as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled, her hips bumping into the wall as she struggled every time the kicking started, down to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pam,\" a voice startled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paul?\" she said softly, and then turned away. She hadn't seen him in days, and in that time she had ballooned up to more than double her weight. She was almost spherical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pam, I'm sorry,\" Paul said, getting right to the point, \"I shouldn't have ran like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela resisted the urge to yell at him, mostly just so that he wouldn't look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't easy for me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela interrupted him softly, \"It's not easy for me, either. I mean, look at me . . .\" She said, spreading her arms to indicate her fattened, pregnant figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Paul walked over and hugged her. She accepted it without much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be hard, you know,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Paul said, and his tone of voice made Pamela realize that he was being sincere, that he wouldn't run away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll try really hard to lose this weight,\" Pamela said, smiling a little. Paul nodded before mumbling something about her not worrying about it, that she was always beautiful, and other such things. Pamela wasn't listening. She was just glad she was no longer alone in this, even if there wasn't much time of 'this' left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>West Hadsley wasn't New York or Chicago, but the new Officer Carly Martinez wasn't going to treat it any different just because it wasn't a big city. It was at least larger than East Hadsley. She had left the academy days before very proud of herself, fit and determined, ready to begin what she knew would be a long, hard, fulfilling career as a police officer. She had done well at the academy and was pleased that she had outdone many of her male classmates. She had put up with some sexism and harassment, and expected to see even more in a smallish town like this. Carly was prepared. She almost welcomed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began her day at 5:00 AM sharp as usual with her workout routine and a run down the street. She was taller than average for a woman at 5'9\" and had a lean, toned figure that, along with her stern expression, could make her very intimidating. The young woman donned her uniform for her first official day on duty and couldn't help but smile to herself proudly. She was going to work her way up through the ranks to detective in no time. West Hadsley might not have a lot of crimes to prevent or solve but that wasn't going to stop Carly from putting her all into the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Morning,\" said an older, gruff-looking office at the front desk as Carly entered the police headquarters. His appearance did not match the friendly tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning,\" Carly said. She held out her hand stiffly to him over the desk, \"I'm here to see Chief Milligan. Officer Martinez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older cop looked at her, then grinned and took her hand. \"Nice to meet you. Chief's that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Carly went straight through the back. A few others glanced at her, some nodding hello with barely any more acknowledgement than that. There was a carefree, easygoing atmosphere to the place Carly found very disconcerting after months of grueling training. She noted that, predictably, every one of the twenty or so officers present were men, and that most of them were middle-aged and out of shape. They all seemed friendly enough, at least the ones who weren't buried in paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood stiffly at the Chief's door and was about to knock when she saw him waving her in from behind his window. He was heavyset, in his 50s, and had a giant mustache that did not hide the giant smile that erupted on his face when he looked up to see her. Before that, he looked quite serious, but as he stood up to greet Carly he seemed more like a friendly, goofy uncle than the hard nosed police chief she was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Officer Martinez,\" he said, shaking her hands rapidly like a salesman. \"Chief Bill Milligan, pleasure's all mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir. I'm proud to be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief chuckled and waved his hand, motioning for Carly to take a seat. He sat down himself. \"There's no need to be so formal around here.\" Carly bristled as she felt he was about to tell her to call him 'Bill,' but he didn't. \"You're just out of the academy then? You settled in? Things going good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are, thank you, sir. I am eager to begin work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief looked amused and Carly knew it was at her demeanor. Even as a kid she had a very stern and serious attitude, a very clipped, direct way of speaking that made people uneasy. The Chief certainly wasn't uneasy. Carly had expected him to be unsure of her, willing to accept her but wanting her to prove herself. Instead, he was overly friendly, leaning back in his chair comfortably, apparently now fully aware that Carly took this very serious and that her, chief of police though he was, did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief leaned forward, \"So Officer, what are your goals here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I plan on eventually becoming a detective, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could use some, that's for sure. Not a whole lot of crime here, though. Listen Martinez,\" he said it firmly but couldn't help smiling as he affected the no-nonsense attitude he could tell Carly was expecting, \"we're a peaceful town with peaceful people. Keeping the peace in a place like this you don't need too strong a hand. Be subtle. Enjoy your work. You'll get to where you want to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly had not expected friendly encouragement. If her welcome here had meant anything, then far from being an organization she would have to prove herself to, it looked like it would take all her effort to make anyone else take this job seriously. She expected an uphill battle against people who didn't take her seriously and was getting the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I guess you should meet your partner. Let's see, who were you going with today?\" looking at his papers, the Chief then glanced past Carly and motioned somebody else in. \"Ah, here's your new partner now-\"</span></div></div>",

She's just out of the academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly quickly stood to take Monica's hand firmly and give her a quick look. She was in her late 30s, Monica guessed, and African American, and almost her height. She was slim but had a slight flair to her hips and little bit of softness around her waist that told Monica she, like the other cops here did not have a strict work out regiment.  She had one a wedding ring. Unlike the garrulous Chief she did not look too happy to see Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Officer,\" Carly said stiffly. Monica took her hand with little enthusiasm. She looked at her, then past her to the Chief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she said flatly, \"Chief, we have any sort of plan to get her trained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trained, at the academy,\" Carly said, hiding her annoyance. Monica blinked, the recent memory of just being told that returning. Carly couldn't tell if, like many of the officers she saw, Monica was completely indifferent to her job or if she was the kind of tough, hard-to-impress experienced partner she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monica, why don't you show Car-er, Officer Martinez around the headquarters and take her out to town. Help her to get to know the area. Officer Harris has been with us fifteen years, you're in good hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's get going,\" Monica said. She glanced up and down Monica again. Monica was having trouble reading her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Carly said to the Chief. By the time she turned Monica was already walking out the door. Carly had to rush to catch up with her. Something told her small talk wouldn't be necessary, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do a drive through town and I'll show you were the main places are. Not a lot of action. People run the stop sign a lot over out east of her where the new factory is, though, so there's that to watch out for. Sometimes teenagers hang out at the preserve so you have to run by there at night. Nobody here likes to drive that far out if they can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to help,\" Carly said, hoping some kind of eagerness in her would make her new partner at least feign some interest. Monica's eyes widened a little, but her expression returned to the same tired, half-annoyed look she had had from the start. They went to the parking lot to Monica's squad car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't expect a lot of action here,\" Monica said as they got in her car, \"It's a slow town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't mean there's not a job to do,\" Carly said. Monica nodded with a shrug and started the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she said, and pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Monica said. Not maliciously or sarcastically, just flatly. \"Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive was pretty uneventful to say the least.  Maybe Monica was right. Maybe this town really was as slow as she said it was. They sat in the car, waiting for something, anything to happen. It was getting late, and the two were getting a little tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked at Monica's ring.  \"So...what's your husband do for a living?\" she asked.  Monica raised an eyebrow.  \"My what?\" Monica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your husband? I...I saw the ring you have on.\" Carly said. She could feel her cheeks growing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a husband.\" Monica replied bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why...oh. I get it now. Cool.\" Carly said, coming to realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly nodded. \"So...how long have you two been together?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve years. What, do you wanna know where we got married and where we went on our Honeymoon, too?\" Monica asked, slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that can wait.\" Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence.  \"You adopted any kids?\" Carly asked. Monica turned towards her. She was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you maybe chill with the personal questions for a while? We're co-workers, not family members.  And the answer's no, by the way. And we're not planning on raising kids, either.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Monica finished talking, a black SUV sped through the intersection on a red light.  \"What the hell?\" Monica exclaimed, putting the car in drive. She turned the siren on and began to speed after the perpetrator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that all about?\" Carly asked. \"I don't know, but we're gonna find out.\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tailed the SUV in hot pursuit. they chased after for a few minutes, but finally the other vehicle pulled over. Monica parked the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, rook. You're up.\" Monica said.  Carly turned to her partner.  \"You want me to talk to the driver?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It'll be good experience for you.\" Monica replied.  \"Okay.\" Carly unbuckled her seatbelt and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't want to do it?\" Carly asked.  \"Oh, come on. I'll be right here if you need me!\" Monica joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly exited the car and approached the SUV. She noticed that the windows were tinted. The driver was a woman in her 40s with glasses and frizzy hair. She had on some sort of badge on her lab coat, but Carly couldn't quite make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, did you know that you ran that red light?\" she asked.  \"Oh...my apologies. I'm a little preoccupied. Busy times at work. You know how it is!\" the driver exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What line of work are you in?\" Carly asked.  \"I'm a scientist for Yaral Industries. Ever heard of it?\" the scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I have.\" Carly said.  \"Oh, well I'm sure you will!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, running red lights can be very dangerous. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to write you a ticket.\" Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist's upbeat demeanor was beginning to disappear. \"Really? Are you sure I can't change your mind?\" the scientist asked, pulling out some cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to bribe me? I'm not going to stoop to that.\" the young officer stated.  \"Fine. Well, if this money won't change your mind, then maybe my friends will!\" the scientist exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hulking men exited the back of the car. They were much, much larger than Carly. One cracked his knuckles while the other cracked his neck.  \"Can I change your mind now, honey?\" the scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't threaten me...\" Carly said, her voice shaking.  The two hired thugs looked at each other. One thug picked up Carly and threw her into the SUV. She collapsed to the ground. Her head hammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica exited the squad car and ran towards the commotion. She hit one of the men in the back of the head, but he barely moved a muscle. In response, he knocked her to the ground and held her down. Carly stayed on the ground in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist threw two cans to the hired thugs. They opened the cans. One thug forced Carly to drink one can, while the Monica was forced to down the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the hired thugs threw the can to the ground as they got back in the SUV. It sped away into the night.  Monica slowly got up to check on Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" she asked.  \"I don't feel good...\" Carly moaned. Monica helped the young officer onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that couldn't have gone any worse.\" Monica stated.  \"Those guys could have killed us. I'd say we got off easy.\" Carly said. \"What the hell was that drink? It tasted terrible.\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica approached the crumpled can on the ground and picked it up. \"Xpect. Looks like some sort of energy drink.\" she said. \"It tasted terrible.\" Carly said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't argue with that. Come on, let's get back to the station.\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned to their desks. Monica put the can of Xpect in one of her drawers. The Chief approached the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go, ladies?\" he asked.  \"Pretty good. Until we got ambushed after pulling over a car that ran a red light.\" Monica said.  \"Oh, really? Try harder next time, I guess.\" he said, returning to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? We aren't in trouble?\" Carly asked, surprised.  \"I told you things are pretty relaxed around here.\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's stomach gurgled. A wave of nausea ran through her.  \"Ugh. I feel sick.\" Carly said, putting a hand over her mouth.  \"You're just nervous after your first taste of action. It happened to me too.\" Monica reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Carly vomited into the trashcan under her desk. \"Oh, on second thought, maybe you should head home for the night.\" Monica said.  \"Yeah, that probably wouldn't be a bad idea.\" Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her things and headed out. As Carly left, Monica began to feel ill as well. She bolted to the restroom and emptied the contents of her stomach. \"Must have been whatever was in that energy drink...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica returned home. It was 11:30. She figured that Angie would be asleep by now, but alas her wife was waiting for her in the living room.  Her shoulder length fiery red hair was always the first thing she saw when she entered the house. \"Hey, babe. Good day at work?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Got a new partner. She's...very determined and inquisitive. I'm sick, by the way. Probably shouldn't touch me.\" Monica said as Angie got up to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. You think a drink or two would help?\" Angie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass on that. I should probably get some rest.\" Monica said.  \"Okay. I'll be in bed sometime soon. Night.\" she said. \"Good night.\" Monica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica retired to her bedroom and changed into her pajamas. She still felt nauseous, and felt like her stomach was doing flips. She hoped that she'd feel better in the morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having spent much of the early hours of the morning leaning over her toilet, Carly barely remembered getting to bed. She must have at some point, since she awoke hours later at the crack of noon. That she had planned on, certainly when she would be working nights, but it still felt weird after training herself to always get up early. Slowly the previous night came back to her. She moaned to herself, feeling humiliated, like a failure. Her first traffic stop should have been a footnote on her way to the top of the force. Instead it went as badly as it possibly could go. That there seemed to be no repercussions, or even follow up, from her partner or the Chief made her feel even worse. Just how lazy and incompetent were the police in this town, and if she could screw up so badly did that mean she belonged with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had thankfully calmed down. The nausea was replaced by a low growl, an almost full feeling. She realized quickly how hungry she was. Carly patted her toned stomach and went to the kitchen. She stopped and blushed. Something about that seemingly normal action suddenly felt strange. She fried up some eggs, threw some toast in the microwave, then for good measure made up some bacon. It all smelled so good. She mixed her usual protein drink which, in her hungry state, even looked appetizing. By the time she was done, having finished off all of her eggs, bacon, and most of her bread, Carly was certain she had never been quite so full. She chugged her second protein drink. Something felt very off about her, perhaps it was her intense hunger when the night before she wouldn't have been able to keep anything down. Or the way her hand now listlessly ran up and down her full, but still hard and flat, stomach. She shook her head to snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's work out was a short one. She was too full to truly run her usual five miles and only made it one before turning back. Also, and this was odder, her breasts were hurting. They were feeling more restrained in her bra than usual. She spent the rest of the day, not researching this Yaral company as she planned, but on the couch eating, resting, and was quite shocked when eight rolled around. Jumping into her uniform, she noticed the buttons strained a little around her chest. She thought little of it. It was just another minor inconvenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was walking in the door as Carly pulled up. She stopped and waited for Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey-\" Carly started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we're going to look into this, but don't go telling anything more to the Chief, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Carly asked. It was highly unusual, but then the Chief's blase dismissal of their assault was, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica sighed and held her head as if having to explain something for the hundredth time. \"Because none of these idiots here are going to take it seriously, and none of them are going to be any help. We'll find these assholes and bring them in ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly recalled how bored Monica looked for most of their ride yesterday, and how she looked quite the opposite. Against her better judgment, she nodded her head firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, glad we're on the same page,\" Monica glanced through the door. Carly saw Monica's hand listless to her middle, rubbing it up and down over her uniform. She turned to Carly with an angry look when she saw her staring, \"What are you looking at? Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went inside, exchanging some nods and waves with the half asleep police force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you ever heard of this Yaral Industries?\" Carly asked as they went to Monica's desk. Carly had yet to be assigned a desk, and took to pulling up a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure have,\" came a smarmy voice from a few desks over. Carly looked to see two officers, both in their 30s, and both with the unmistakable looks of people who just couldn't pass up a chance to show off or show somebody up, no matter how trivial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about anything, Petersen?\" Monica said, logging into her computer without even looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral brought out the old factory on the other side of town for one thing. Last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and didn't that lady have something crazy to say about them last week? That's more what I was thinking, not the factory thing,\" said the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly and Monica exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What crazy thing did she have to say?\" Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetersen and his cohort shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said they drugged her. She thought she was pregnant and that it was their fault. Was that the half of it, Morris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about it. She didn't look pregnant to me. Just crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was this?\" Monica stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six, seven days ago? Why, who cares? What do you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're working a case,\" Monica said, \"You know, those things involving crimes that we're paid to stop from happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smirked at each other. After some hedging they did tell her what the potential victim had told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to see her or to the factory?\" Carly asked, exhilarated to be jumping into action despite the gnawing hunger quickly building in her. Monica's stomach sounded like it was feeling the same as Carly's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Let's start small, I'm thinking we question this Eva Jakowski about what she knows about Yaral,\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's stomach gurgled loudly. \"Wherever we go, let's go through a drive through on the way.\"</span></div></div>",

Carly did a quick search for her online. She seemed to be just a normal young woman. Pretty, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Monica said as they pulled through a drive through. The smell of grease wafting into their squad car was strangely enticing even for the health-conscious Carly. Her stomach, feeling a little tight from her breakfast, rumbled under her hand as she rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe . . . maybe a few double quarter pounders. Like, two . . . three?\" she found herself saying. Monica raised an eyebrow at her  causing Carly to uncharacteristically blush and, again to her surprise, start rubbing her stomach softly with both hands. When Monica glanced down, she stopped, embarrassed.  Monica then turned to the window and ordered a dozen burgers and some sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate ravenously as they drove, barely speaking to each other. After the third burger Carly had to stop. She shook her head, holding her painfully full stomach. Did it actually look as full as she felt? Her uniform did feel slightly snug up front. Monica was no better, although she ate slower, methodically. <i>Now she's looking bloated,</i> Carly thought as she saw her partner's stomach oozing just a little over her belt and into her seatbelt. But then she had already known that Monica had a classic tall, skinny-fat figure. She must gain weight easily, Carly thought, feeling a little bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she managed to scarf down another burger just as they arrived at the house. As they exited the cars, both wobbled just a little. Monica belched loudly and Carly barely was able to keep hers in. They both look at each other, slightly confused, and then rapidly tore their hands from their own full tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find anything else about her not in the report?\" Monica asked as they approached the door. Both women felt a little restriction around their waists, like their belts should go out another notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing-urp-god, sorry-nothing that interesting. Seems like a normal girl. Nothing about Yaral and her, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica rang the door bell. The two stood at attention in that casual cop way. Monica belched again while they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, sorry,\" she said, \"Why the hell did I eat all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly shook her head and shrugged, not willing to openly admit that she had stuffed herself just as disgracefully. Monica knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anybody home? This is the police,\" she said loudly and sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard a voice and shuffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police?\" the voice said, belong to a woman who was either tired, scared, or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened a moment later and both officers could not suppress their surprise as Eva Jakowski appeared. Carly even gasped. This was not the slim, normal young woman who had filed the report of being drugged by scientists or businessmen last week. She was now quite pregnant, or at least looked it. Her breasts and face looked bloated and round, her hips must have widened significantly, and her belly dominated her figure like nothing Carly or Monica had ever seen. She waved as she stood, one hand holding the door frame and the other on her bare, horribly bloated belly. She was wearing a pair of sweatpants which her belly and ass almost pushed off of her, and a huge t-shirt which left most of her belly, stretch marks and nobbly naval all, very visible. Carly felt sick to her stomach and held her own slightly swollen middle in her hand. Still, she retained her professionalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'am, we'd like to ask you a few questions,\" Monica recovered from the sight of the cartoonishly pregnant woman faster than Carly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about? About this?\" she said, her exhaustion letting some anger, or maybe just sarcasm, seep out. \"When I came to the police station last week nobody cared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva winced and doubled forward. A series of large, alien movements wrapped around the surface of her belly. Carly took a step back. Monica didn't reveal any surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Jakowski, we'd like to ask you what you know about Yaral Industries. May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral?\" Evan said as the movements passed, \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-\" Carly recognized the fear in Eva's eyes and stepped forward, but Eva was already waddling backwards into her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're watching me! They're watching everyone. You don't understand. They told me I was just testing some new drinks, and then, and then . . .\" her voice shrunk to a whisper as her eyes darted around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, drinks?\" Carly said stepping closer. \"What about 'drinks'?\" She felt a concern rising within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva calmed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some kind of soda. It was awful. They said they were taste testing them. I only tried it once, though. They asked me to come back the next day and report how I felt. I thought it was a little weird. I was sick all night, and the next morning, I felt,\" she choked up a little as her hands ran down as much of her belly as they could, \"I told them I felt hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica and Carly gave each other knowing looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd like to come in, Ms. Jakowski,\" Monica said. \"If they're watching you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are. They want to see that what this is is safe,\" she said with a bitter smile. \"Please, just stay away. I told you everything I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from me,\" Eva said, but before she closed the door, she stopped, \"There were a few others, too. We worked at the mall together and knew each other, so that's how we got roped in. But,\" she glanced behind them to a van down the street. \"Shit,\" Eva said, her face falling. She closed the door as fast as her overgrown body would let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica started to knock again, but Carly stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she meant about drinks?\" Carly said. It didn't take a particularly clever detective to see some connection. \"She drinks something Yaral gives her and a week late winds up a human balloon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't dwell on it. She won't talk, she's too scared-\" Monica looked to her younger partner to see that Carly's expression showed not only worry, but some fear, too. Carly held on hand on her stomach, lightly pressing it through her uniform. It definitely felt a little puffy. That would be rare enough, as Carly's perfectly fit body never got so much as bloated. But with her appetite that day, and that she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the witness's uncooperative nature both officers knew that they gained valuable information by coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call,\" Carly said, removing her hand from her belly and placing them on her hips, standing defiantly despite her half-formed fear of what happening to both of them. \"Do we go find more victims among her co-workers or check out the factory now?\"</span></div></div>",

She works in the ladies' formal wear section.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you figure that?\" Monica said, sounding impressed and realizing right away that of course Carly found that out. She had been doing just basic searches on Eva on the ride over. She nodded her head as Carly just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then, let's go to the mall,\" Monica said. Both their stomachs rumbled, and they both found themselves unconsciously rubbing their full stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even asking Monica pulled through a Taco Hut on the way and began ordering. She glanced to Carly, like it was perfectly normal to be ordering another huge helping of fast food after eating multiple burgers earlier. \"You want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhg, no,\" Carly said, but her stomach's growl betrayed her. Why was she so hungry? The answer, of course, was right on the edge of her mind, but her thought process veered away from that direction. \"How can you can eat all that junk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking, Ms. Six Pack,\" Monica said with a very slight smile and nodding towards the wrappers of the fatty lumps of pseudo-food which now rested packed and writing in Carly's stomach. \"Hey, see if we have any word on Yaral. Our research guys have to be good for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly, glaring at both Monica and, briefly, her stuffed stomach, called headquarters and found that, strangely, nobody had ever heard of Yaral Industries. They reached the mall with no more information than before, and with Carly feeling guilty for having eaten two of Monica's tacos. At least her stomach stopped growling. But the increased heaviness, now with a healthy and uncomfortable dose of gassiness, were worse. As they strode in their authoritative police way through the Bately &amp; Stein's to the help desk Carly felt that that they both appeared less intimidating than the otherwise would have. It frustrated her to no end how her hands kept gravitating towards her stomach, which felt very confined by her belt and slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica, looking stern, almost bored, approached who they assumed was the manager while her shorter partner walked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'am, I'm Officer Harris. This is Officer Martinez. Are you the manager here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" she said. \"What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd like to ask you a few questions about Eva Jakowski. She works here, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she did, but we haven't seen her in a week, and nobody's heard from her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three, and some of the customers turned their head just in time to see a side emergency door swing open and a man flee out of it. He was dressed fashionably as all employees of the upscale department. Carly's heart raced, her instincts kicking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got him,\" she said, not even turning back to look at Monica not even trying to run with her. Carly took off. She was momentarily impeded by the door being locked, and lost a good thirty seconds as the manager unlocked it. No matter. She could hear the suspect reaching the bottom of the flights of stairs. Carly was in top form, she thought, every trained muscle in her toned body working together to first rush her down the stairs and then, as the bottom door opened the man continued to run, over the last railing and landing practically right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze, police!\" she yelled as she slammed the door open and saw him running across the back lot. She ran, picking up speed, this guy was fast but there was no way he was as trained, or as in as good of shape, as Carly. Carly had run faster than this, and longer, during her daily workouts. This was why, the sudden, growing stitch in her side was unusual. She brushed it off, but found she couldn't pick up speed, and the suspect wasn't getting any closer. He was only fifteen feed ahead of her now, if she could only do one last sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's stomach heaved, she almost tripped but tried to keep running. All the food she had stuffed herself with early rushed into her memory. She gritted her teeth, pumping her arms and legs for all she was worth to get past the enormous cramp building in her middle. It felt like a lead ball had been placed there and was no exerting its gravity. Also, and this caught her by surprise, her breasts felt sore suddenly. They were moderately sized and well secured, and she hadn't had any problem during any of her exercising before, but she was struck just now at the worst moment with an almost painful discomfort. It did not, however, rival the queasiness growing inside her. She gripped her stomach and had to stop, feeling to her knees, heaving, breathing, her heart beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaanhhhhhh!\" she growled in a frustrated, humiliated moan as her arms wrapped tightly around her middle. The contents of her stomach churned violently, threatening to rise up and further humiliate her. With her arms tight against her stomach she would very much feel how ridiculous full she was it. It felt like a gyrating rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeeeeze!\" she yelled getting to her feet with one arm still around her middle. This couldn't be happening. She was doing everything right, had done everything to prepare her mind and body for just such an occasion, and now her body was betraying her. \"Stop, damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, halfway across the parking lot now, slowed, turned, and even stopped. She saw he had a name tag but could not read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze, god damn it, we're the police!\" Carly picked up the pace to a trot again, but knew that she would need a rest before even trying to chase somebody down again. The man turned and ran, but not nearly as fast as before. Carly glared, growling to herself. Proving herself as a cop to herself seemed like it hinged on catching this random person right then.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The suspect was not racing for any vehicle, but instead the woods that surrounded this part of the mall. He might lose Carly there. Or, she thought as she fought through the pain in her sides and the heavy feeling in her middle, he would trip himself up and make an easy target. Carly grunted and pushed herself forward until, seconds later, somebody else did her job for her. A van, black and official, like a government vehicle, was racing around the edge of the parking lot alongside the woods. Carly and the suspect both saw it at the same time. He slowed down looking at it and Carly, then ran diagonally away from it. The van was too fast. It skidded to a stop, blocking Carly's view. Her sides were splitting, her stomach was heaving, the skin feeling like it was stretched across a drum, and her breasts sent a jolt of through with every movement, but Carly sprinted ahead with gritted teeth. She heard some struggling, a yell, and was mere feet from the van when she heard the door on the other side slam shut as the van took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze!\" Carly yelled again. She hadn't even seen who was driving it, and didn't know whether or not the suspect went willing and with thanks, or was kidnapped. She screamed a nonsense cry at the van, stamping her foot. There was no license plate, either. Her heart beating faster than it had in a very long time, even during her most strenuous work outs, Carly clutched her arms around her middle and fell to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Martinez,\" came the softly authoritative tone of her partner as she jogged casually up behind her. \"Did he go with them or did they take him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuh,\" Carly shook her head, which was now spinning. She was positive she would throw up now. Her stomach heaved under her arms. It felt like it was placed in a vice. \"Don't know,\" she forced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica gave her her hand to help her up. Carly shook her head and stood up herself, hunched over still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit,\" Carly said, \"I'll be fine. Too . . . much food,\" she said, which must be the case. Carly could kick herself. She hardly ever indulged, certainly not to the absurd degree she had been doing. She couldn't bring herself to be mad at her, but she did blame Monica's habits for it. She'll just have to be careful when she eats around her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Monica said, a little annoyance in her voice, \"I already called it in it. No license on the van, was there? Damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica looked off to where the van had fled. Their squad car was on the other side of the mall. By the time they had gotten to it the suspects would have been well away from them. She rubbed her stomach absentmindedly. Considering how full she felt it actually felt good, even soothing. Her radio squawked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a black van speeding along Pine Oak, Dr. just crossing 4th, no ID on it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger, thanks,\" Monica said. \"Come on, let's go talk to that manager. Don't beat yourself up. That guy was a speed demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have caught him,\" Carly said as her breath returned and the pain, but not the discomfort, subsided. Without thinking she squeezed one of her breasts and gasped, hoping Monica didn't see her. It was painful, but oddly pleasurable. She wanted to get out of her bra and, and this part made her even more embarrassed for herself, unbutton her strangely snug slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it,\" Monica said sternly, \"If you keep feeling sorry for yourself over every thing that goes wrong you're not going to last long in this job, let alone make detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly nodded. It made sense. She wondered if Monica was still a uniformed officer after all these years because she wanted to be, because she wasn't good enough to move any further upward, or something had held her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were able to get some useful information from the manager and other co-workers. The suspect who fled and was rescued/captured was named Derek Bryan. He was a sales associate in the men's section. He was work friends with Eva and the two often spoke and sometimes took lunch together. They didn't seem to see each other outside of work as far as the manager knew. One co-worker suggested otherwise, but then backed off. Carly and Monica both suspect that, like Eva, this girl had a lot more to tell than she let on. She was small, pretty, and quiet, barely out of high school and so a few years younger than Eva or Derek, so it would be no surprise if she really didn't know anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give us a call if you remember anything,\" Monica said, handing the girl, Ashley, her number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just want to help,\" Carly said in as comforting a voice as she could muster in her increasing discomfort. Her stomach had stopped doing flips but was now lulling heavily back and forth, and her hands were constantly moving to it against her will. She wound up gripping her belt tightly to stop them from wandering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will,\" Ashley said. She looked like she was going to say more, but didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica checked in with the station. After the initial update there was no news on the mystery van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do all witnesses refuse to say anything remotely useful?\" Carly asked when they walked back to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes. They're usually not hiding from anything as weird as this, though,\" Monica said, then pressed her hand to her mouth and stifled a burp. \"''Scuse me. Let's get back to the station and get this paperwork done and call it a night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly realized that it was, in fact, night now. She also realized she was exhausted, something which her body had politely hid from her for the last few hours. Annoying, infuriatingly, her stomach's loud growling indicated that she was also hungry again. With a grimace as she buckled her seatbelt across her full tummy and tender breasts, she turned to Monica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but let's go through a drive-thru or something first.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monica was able to file the paperwork for that day with effortless efficiency. Carly did not. She was frustrated with herself, vacillating between the urge to go out and keep working through the night and to hide herself away. They finished late and parted ways. Monica, who had repeated to Carly to not beat herself up over losing the suspect, patted her on the shoulder as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made good progress today. Nothing to be ashamed of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Carly said not feeling it, \"See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her pants and bra that night were much more relieving than ever before, and Carly passed out on her bed almost instantly, her hand listlessly caressing her stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Carly would rise at 6:00, take a jog around the neighborhood for a half hour, and then work out for another half hour in her own personal gym. It took up most of her apartment. Today was different. Carly slept through her alarms, and when she did finally get up at a quarter to 9:00 she did not rise with her usual vigor, but awoke slowly and with difficulty. Her first thought was that she was late. Her second was that she was hungry. She growled. Of course today would be off to a bad start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly moved her normally limber body off the bed she felt some odd resistance, like something was keeping her down. She rubbed her eyes as she made her way to the bathroom. She yawned and moved her hands down to her middle. She arched her back, cracking it as she did so, and opened her eyes again just as she caught sight of her profile in the bathroom mirror. She had a sudden, visceral feeling of embarrassment she had not had about her body since her awkward teenage days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she said out loud and tore her hands away from her stomach. She was bloated, very bloated, more than yesterday. In fact, her toned, flat tummy looked positively puffy, even round. It stuck out several inches, completely hiding her proud abs. She rubbed it. It felt firm, not like fat, so it was definitely a case of very bad bloating. But it wasn't the only thing different. No sooner had Carly moaned in frustration at the effects of yesterday's binging than she felt a heaviness in her chest. If her stomach was bloated, her breasts felt just as swollen, almost full. They looked on the verge of losing their usual perkiness. She lifted on in her hand, shocked at how heavy it felt, but more shocked by the tingling and wave of bizarre pleasure that show through her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unbelievable,</i> Carly thought, turning to view herself head on. <i>This can NOT be happening to me.</i>The rest of her looked just as trim and toned as always, although her hips and ass were both sporting a little extra which were overshadowed by her tummy and breasts. She patted her stomach and, to her own shock, felt a very brief moment of tears welling up. She shook it off. That was definitely not like her. And neither was pigging out all day and missing her morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two days on the force and I'm already turning into a pig,</i> she thought, blaming Monica. She was determined today would not be a repeat of yesterday, both for her work and her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly ate her usual healthy breakfast, but much more than she would have liked. She simply couldn't stop herself. When she went to get dressed she felt even fuller than before. The somewhat loose uniform pants now felt snug around her hips and ass, but what she noticed was that her tummy was noticeably restricted up front. Even letting her belt out looser still put pressure on the button. If she bent over she thought it would snap. And yet she couldn't stop rubbing that smooth, tight, curved surface every time her mind wandered. She growled at herself. These pants were supposed to be utilitarian and formless. They actually looked flattering now despite the tightness up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is wrong with me? I'm slacking off and pigging out and I can't stop touching this gut,</i> she thought, refusing to accept that that was, in fact, her perfectly toned tummy sticking out of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to wear her bra on its loosest setting and even that sent waves of odd sensations through her when she moved. When she went to button her shirt, though, there was trouble. Yes, it went around her middle despite her bloating, albeit with visible tightness, but she could just barely get it buttoned across her chest. It wouldn't do. There was no denying it. After years of keeping herself in tip top shape she had fattened herself out of her uniform within three days. She suppressed a scream and took a furious swing at her mirror, stopping herself just in time before she injured herself. She didn't know what was upsetting her more: her unfortunate few first days at work, her figure's unwanted changes, or how her usual stable mood was now bouncing all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to get another shirt at work, and probably some pants. She threw on a jacket and, ignoring the growls of hunger from her stomach, went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Carly was having a hard time waking up, Monica's was easier only because she herself was normally less volatile and emotional than her young partner. She awoke, with difficulty, but at her usual time. She would normally wake up Angie to say bye for the day, but today she didn't. She didn't because she didn't want Angie to see her getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica was tall and lean, but with some softness around her middle and sides. Still, she had never been close to fat. Until today. Monica awoke to find the cling t-shirt she slept in actually looking tight, both stretching around her breasts and riding up on her stomach. She looked full and bloated, her breasts as well as her stomach. Her hips and ass had filled out the loose shorts she had work to bed. She could actually pinch much more flab at her sides than she could remember even if her stomach was firm, and round. Her face, too, usually quite slim, seemed to have softened as if overnight. It made her look a little younger, she thought. But if the cost of looking slightly younger was to get chubby then that wasn't a price Monica would want to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bound to happen, Monica,</i> she told herself as she cupped her swollen belly, out almost as far as her breasts, in her hands, <i>You don't stay in shape, you're getting older, it was only a matter of time before you got fat.</i> Well, not fat yet, but she had put on some weight. She recalled how tight her uniform was yesterday and decided that she would just need to go up a size. She could do that at work. She wasn't too broken up about it, although she knew she should start working out. She didn't want to become like so many of her co-workers who had started putting on weight and didn't stop. Besides, she knew she was gorgeous with a great figure, and didn't exactly want to give that up even if it wasn't the whole world to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in sweats, at lest one hand always inexplicably on her rounded belly, Monica went off to work to meet up with Carly and continue their investigation.</span></div></div>",

Her uniform felt a little snug all over, despite sneaking a larger size out of the supplies room at the station. Partly, it was the tight feeling in her tummy that wouldn't go away, a strange tingling in her swollen breasts, and the fact that her thighs were rubbing together. She wasn't going to let it get her down, not too much, and was glad she could get in and do so before too many people noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could keep her from bolting to the breakfast table which Office Bill James was always sure to fill. He was a heavy guy, heavier every year, but jovial and one of the few cops who actually seemed to care. It's a good thing he had been behind a desk for a few years now since he was not good at actual police work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly, of course, arrived later than she wanted. Later still, since she swung by a fast food place and picked up some greasy snacks to keep her stomach from crying out in the agony of hunger. She ate angrily, with the distinct feeling that she wasn't so much eating as filling up her stomach to get it as full as humanly possible. Once the anger passed, she sat in her car for a few minutes holding back tears of frustration and self loathing, then felt a renewed sense of purpose and, as quickly as she could, ran inside and into the supplies room with only a few glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a new uniform. The only pants she could find for her height were a little too loose around the middle, but at least they hide her bloating. After stuffing her face all morning she actually felt like her stomach was bigger, rounder even. She picked out a shirt that was also too loose, tucking it in and consequently highlighting her slim, albeit currently bloated, waist, and went to the lobby as if she was just coming to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetersen and his partner, Hansen, cut her off as she entered, making a straight shot for the breakfast table for some coffee. Carly did a double take as she saw her partner from behind already there. Her ass seemed bigger, no, <i>was</i> bigger. As Carly slowly made her way over she made out a definite belly pooch. How could she have thought Monica was thin when they first met, she wondered. She was clearly getting a wider middle-aged figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay off the sweets, Harris,\" Petersen said loudly as he pushed past her and poured two coffees for him and Hansen. Hansen, for his part, gave Monica a quicky look up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus-\" he started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your damn mouth, Hansen,\" Monica said, a little angry but more annoyed than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So I'm not the only one who thinks she looks bigger today?</i> Carly thought. Her hand grazed her stomach. It felt warm, full, just slightly queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard you were here late last night filling out paperwork,\" Petersen said, leaning and sipping his coffee, \"And that your rookie here let some kid get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd know the whole story if you didn't cut out early every day,\" Monica said, turning to see Carly there, and then added for good measure, \"Ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetersen grumbled but only let his smile fall a little. With a huff, he motioned to Hansen and the two began walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need any more leads on that wild goose chase, tubbs,\" he said. Monica rolled her eyes. She stuffed the last bite of a doughnut into her mouth. She had eaten five just standing there. She rubbed her stomach absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Carly said, getting some coffee for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how are you doing?\" Monica said, her tone going from gruff and frustrated to almost genuinely concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Carly said, and she too began rubbing her stomach gently.  \"Good,\" she repeated, \"So does everyone know how I screwed up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock that talk off,\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harris!  Hey, Harris! Monica, you got a call!\" came the friendly voice of Bill James from his desk.  Monica grabbed another doughnut and motioned for Carly to follow. Carly audible winced as she took one herself. Feelings of defeat overwhelmed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says her name is Ashley, said you talked last night,\" Bill handed Monica the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Office Harris here . . . Yes, we remember . . . Could you repeat that?\" her tone suddenly became comforting, which sounded strange to Carly who hadn't heard her talk like that before, \"You just relax, understand? We'll be right over . . . Just stay put and stay calm, all right? . . . . That's fine, good bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that girl who knew more than she said last night? She wants to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she sound?\" Carly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ladies, need a hand on this thing?\" Bill asked. Monica chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll let you know, Bill. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica and Carly were both strangely quiet on the ride over. This was not like the uncomfortable silences of their first day. Now they were both getting to know each other and both could recognize that something was laying heavily on the other. Carly vaguely recalled a sudden spike in fear yesterday while on the case, but it seemed something so ridiculous that now she could only remember the sensation. She burped quietly, her hand rubbing her stomach. She was slouching a little, unusual for her. Under the tight belt she could make out the new little bulge of her tummy. She felt a flood of emotions which, upon reflection, she decided was aggravation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martinez-\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Carly snapped. \"Sorry, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley lived in a small apartment in one of the larger complexes in town. This surprised Monica, who took her to be just out of high school. Maybe she left to be on her own earlier than most. They found the apartment and knocked a few times before, the chain still on the door, Ashley peaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just you two, right?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, may we come in, Ashley?\" Monica asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the abandoned factory, okay? That's where they did it. Derek was finding people to test their new drink, but I don't think it's a soda or anything, I don't know what it is,\" she was speaking fast, her eyes darting around. \"And Eva had a lot, and it made her bigger, like she was . . . pregnant, or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know, can we come in and ask you a few questions-\" Monica asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go there and stop them!\" Ashley whisper-yelled, \"You know they just grabbed Derek like they were watching him all the time? They're probably watching me too, because I agreed to go with him and some others and try it two days ago, even though I know something wasn't right and that Eva stopped coming to work, but . . . I just needed the money, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, we can discuss this more calmly inside,\" Monica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly looked around. Ashley's frantic paranoid was getting to her, too. Come to think of it, she wasn't even looking around to see if they were followed or if any of those suspicious black vans were around outside. This girl could be right about being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to keep talking about it?\" Ashley said, louder now. \"Look, look!\" she lifted up the oversized hoodie she was wearing and revealed her pale, round stomach. \"Look what they're doing to us! Go stop them!\" While nowhere near as monstrous as Eva's belly, it looked very out of place on such a small girl. Monica knew exactly how she felt. Her few days of stuffing as giving her the same feeling of roundness in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica and Carly exchanged looks. Ashley quickly covered her stomach up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" Monica whispered to Carly. \"Ashley, if you need anything here is my personal cell number. Call us or the police, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded and, after a quick good bye, closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time,\" Carly said, \"So abandoned factory then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so smug, we were getting there anyways, you know,\" Monica said. The two wasted no time in getting back to their car.  On the way there, she called headquarters and asked if she could get somebody to watch Ashley's apartment building. They agreed, but as Monica knew, there was no guarantee they would be quick about it, or even if they would send somebody reliable. Monica grimaced. She did not want to leave a scared young woman, and so far their best, most talkative lead on the case, alone, but she wanted to at least check out the factory right away. She toyed with the idea of having one of them stay behind while the other went to scout out the factory, and then they would meet up when they were guaranteed Ashley had a guard over her.</span></div></div>",
