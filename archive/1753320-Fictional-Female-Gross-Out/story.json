After a nice breakfast, Cammy hopped in the show and prepared to wash herself. However, the water didn't seem to start up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, why is no water coming out?\" she thought.

Plumber after plumber had made an appointment, only to cancel at the last possible minute, and Cammy's stubborn pride kept her from going to somewhere where her hygiene could be maintained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst part?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, a tiny little piece of Cammy was starting to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a week, Cammy was hardly a garbage dump, but with a daily 4-hour workout routine, she knew she soon would be, and yet... getting up in the morning, and pulling the same shirt over her head, she couldn't deny that there was something a little taboo about the pungent aroma her armpits produced. As the sweat stains of her shirt slid back into their place under her stubbly underarms, she realized with a slight pang of worry that she was becoming increasingly used  to feeling the dampness they provided. However, turning to the mirror by her bedside reminded her of the less satisfactory parts of her new regime. Her unwashed hair was beginning to become thick with grease, although much of it was luckily concealed by her signature ponytail. She also noticed that the accumulated sweat, dirt and grime on her face has started to show create worrying signs of a spot infestation, or even worse, acne, although the few that currently existed were luckily localized to a few small parts of her forehead. Cammy was also pretty disgusted by the dirt and grit that had appeared under her fingernails and toenails, and worried about the difficulty of removing it once her pipes (and cleanliness) came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWort of all though, at least in Cammys eyes, was the deteriorating state of her mouth. Without any water, Cammy was resorting to picking the worst of meals out of her teeth with toothpicks, but that hadn't stopped the buildup of plaque, as her teeth were already beginning to lose their carefully maintained whiteness and sheen. Cupping her hand to her mouth, Cammy attempted to smell her breath, but, in her clumsy, early morning stupor, accidentally burped instead, forcing her to confront the growing bacteria in her mouth, and causing her to gag on her own gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, this new lifestyle of mine has really GOT to change\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing her underarm and sighing wistfully, Cammy set out to finally get cleaned up, however...</span></div></div>",

After venturing out many times to stop Soul Edge, it felt good to settle down with her husband and children, enjoying the pleasant future ahead of her provided by serving Hephaestus faithfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought. The sound of a bladed weapon drew her attention to a dark corner of the house. When a strange woman with black hair and a bladed hula hoop stepped out, Sophitia got up from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTira stood there, grinning. \"Hi again. Remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I do!\" Sophitia reached for her sword, to find, to her horror, that it was gone! On top of it, in the time it took her to reach, Tira had closed the gap and shoved her face up to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could kill you in your sleep if I wanted. Your family too. I'm giving you a chance to avoid that if you'll do one little thing for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophitia didn't like the sound of that. Any time an evil creature like Tira wanted something, it always led to horrible consequences. She could take getting killed or tortured, but with her family on the line, she caved. \"What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTira giggled fiendishly. \"Soul Edge wants you to serve it, but I have another condition. You're a beautiful, well-behaved mother. It makes me sick. It's time you went on a quest, Sophitia, to make a name for yourself as the grossest, nastiest woman ever born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned Greece swordswoman went pale at Tira's demand.</span></div></div>",

If I hear one peep about that you'll be dead in seconds\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophitia just nodded as Tira cackled. Suddenly a shadow flashed and Tira was gone.

Tira must want to make certain I don't starve before I can become as gross as she wants me to be,\" she surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a single crisp bite into the apple. Juice dribbled down her chin, and the tasty treat went down her throat easy. Bite after bite, she ate her way down until the apple was nothing but its core. She threw it aside, wiped her lips and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good snack. If I had a big enough bag, I would\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPFFFTT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophitia blushed and darted her hands to the back of her toga, catching her ruffling skirt and pulling it down.

She stood fixed and frozen for the next full minute, and when her ass finally came to an eerie quiet, she held her face in shame.

But her heritance had  had always felt more like an obligation than a calling, and she has yet to do some truly innovative with the Amagi inn.Which was why the information on the pamphlet she was handed whilst travelling back from school troubled her so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Are you Tired of the stuffy Amagi inn?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Do you want to know what REAL comfort feels like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen visit the hayabusa inn, home of relaxation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to our opening at Junes on Monday and get FREE gym membership for a month!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA competitor? with it's own gym? Who had enough money to invest in something like that in inaba? They can't seriously think that people would just abandon the Amagi inn after years of custom,she thought to herself. or would they? Due to school and other commitments, she had failed to do anything revolutionary with the inn, and they had been hemorrhaging customers, and, unlike this new inn, they weren't located in a department store.\"Think yukiko, think, what advantage do we have over these guys\" she whispered under her breath<br>\r\n\" Oh hey I have an idea\" Rise said. Yukiko jumped backwards, looking at rise.<br>\r\n\" how long have you been standing there rise?\" she said angrily<br>\r\n\"Oh around 10 minutes, I didn't want to interrupt you hyperventilating and cursing under your breath. That inn sounds pretty cool doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n\" It most certainly does not, do you have any idea what this could mean for my families business?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I joke, I came to apologize for that little spat we had over yu, thought I would try and repair our friendship. You wan't a advantage? I'm Risette, Japans teen sensation, Think about the money a free promotion could give to your business.\"<br>\r\nIt seemed fortune had smiled on Yukiko, she was just given the potential Savior to her inn, gift wrapped for her. She eyed up rise greedily. For once, the cameras would report some positive news about the inn.\" when can you call your people?\" She said.<br>\r\n\"OK, firstly, if we're gonna be as close as you and Chie you're gonna need to stop looking at me like that and secondly, from the way your panicking over one leaflet, your probably overreacting. I've dealt with competitors in the past, and what I'll say is that they're never as good as you build them up in your head, how about we start with something small, like going to their launch on Monday? It's only too days away and they're hardly going to bankrupt you when they're not open yet.\"Yukiko looked worried for a second, but she realized rise was right.She could take the weekend off, bathe in the hotsprings and come to that launch on monday, fresh and ready to conquer.Meanwhile, Rise prepare for her debut as the face of her inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a princess, of course, Marle was expected to maintain a high standard of hygiene, one of the few requirements of her station that she complied with without objection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was also known for journeying through time with her friends to stop an extraterrestrial parasite, but you knew that already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Marle and her friends Crono and Lucca were on yet another time-hopping journey, attempting to locate Crono's mother and cats, who had vanished into the timestream during the celebration of their triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was a general overview of what she was doing anyway. What she was specifically doing at that exact point in time happened to be hogging the washroom at the local inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Marle,\" Lucca complained as she pounded on the door, \"You've been in there for over an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, with the sound of water shutting off, Marle stepped out of the washroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Lucca sighed, \"What were you even doing in there? We were supposed to leave 45 minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have to take my time to stay fresh, you know.\" Marle 'explained'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, we'd have finished this quest a long time ago if you would stop holding us up at every stop,\" Lucca mumbled, and then got a mischievous glint in her eye as an idea came to her head. \"Actually, are you up for a little bet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of bet?\" Marle asked, clearly interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can stay out of the washroom completely for one month, I'll make you whatever you want. But if you cave, I get to use your... 'connections' for my own ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarle didn't like the sound of that, but Lucca could potentially build her just about anything, and besides, she wasn't one to turn down a bet, so she simply smiled and said \"You're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
