            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria Vandergast loved her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the ultimate status symbol for anyone who was their own boss. Rich wood paneling, an artfully sturdy mahogany desk, framed accolades on the wall next to her degrees and a city view out the window. And her ergonomic out-sized office chair that had to be custom made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her life Gloria had never been skinny. Who would trust a skinny chef, anyways? You could tell from her size that she loved food just as much as she loved ruling over the kitchen with an iron fist. Currently she tipped the scales at around the two hundred pound mark, which filled out her five foot four inch frame considerably. She had a thick middle, rounded hips, pudgy thighs and a moderately sized chest for someone of her frame. Her skin was dark tan and her hair a darker midnight black, kept shoulder length whenever she didn\u2019t tie up her hair for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe favored clothes that made a statement and her typical business suit was no exception. A maroon, velvet accented suit with pencil skirt ending just above the knee. Like her chair it also had to be custom made for her size, as the original style of the suit was for the petite body. Gloria liked it for being just snug enough, a bold statement piece that made her chest look more impressive when combined with her favorite bra. Although a few of the buttons were starting to look strained\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was a shrewd and driven businesswoman. She had graduated with masters for both culinary arts and business degrees, a skilled chef who didn\u2019t want to labor under anyone else\u2019s kitchen. So she started her own company, becoming a Kitchen Boss looking to build her brand with a backbone of fantastic kitchens and any other business to cater to her customers' lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew her food could be fattening and her restaurants were criticized for targeting the overweight and obese. Gloria didn\u2019t care; in her eyes the fat demographic would bring her the most wealth. Why not have have \u201cwhales\u201d for her standout patrons, or whales? She'd feed them for breakfast, lunch, or dinner if it meant her wallet expanded faster than their waistline. It was a growing customer base in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria\u2019s dominate business strategies followed along the lines of her vices: Envy, Greed, and Gluttony. And not always in that specific order. Gloria couldn\u2019t stand anybody having something she didn\u2019t have, be it property or acclaim, especially if it was one of her rival Kitchen Bosses. Gloria always wanted more, she wanted to make big money and was never fully satisfied with the status quo. And she was a big eater, constantly snacking and tasting as she perfected her recipes, savoring her food far too messily in contrast to the image of a successful Kitchen Boss that she wanted to present. Each of her vices naturally fed into the next, part of what had made her the boss she was today\u2026although left unchecked that could be disastrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou give me half price on those shoddy, already rotting fruits you call \u2018organic produce\u2019 or I\u2019m taking my business elsewhere!\u201d Gloria bullied a supplier on the other end of the phone over her morning latte and pastry. \u201cOr you\u2019ll never sell greens in this town again. I\u2019ve got a lot of clout with the local chamber of commerce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up the phone smugly as she took a big bite of her apple-cream cheese danish, knowing her supplier would have to meet her price or be finished. Closing a deal always got Gloria fired up for the day. She couldn't spend all day sitting back over fancy coffee and her pastry. She had a budding kitchen empire to run, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the first order of the day?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was most likely one of the greatest days in Gloria Vanderghast's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was she opening a brand new kitchen known as \"Gloria's Steakhouse\" within the big city of Trussel within a week, her first restaurant within a widely populated city, but she had also received hundreds of job offers from chefs all across the state to become chefs at her new kitchen. She had already hired another chef to work under her, a tan-skinned rotund woman by the name of Nicole Harker, but now she was looking over dozens of other chefs, so she could choose which one to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving her way to Gloria's Steakhouse, the Kitchen Boss would quickly notice said chef walk up as well. \"Ah, Nicole. You up here to check out the meals of the other chefs too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can't miss out a good meal after all. Who knows, we may even find someone who actually would work well here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at a minuscule 4'10\", Nicole would end up being even shorter than Gloria, which was somewhat impressive considering the Kitchen Boss's own short stature. However, despite being shorter, Nicole would appear to be the heavier one, weighing in at around 50 more pounds than her boss and appearing even fatter due to the weight being localized in a smaller area. Not only was she looking somewhat obese, but her hips in particular were two huge pillars of fat, which the woman took pride in whenever it would shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, yeah I can't wait to enjoy these meals as well... who knows, maybe we'll find something that's actually good, and then we can have another great chef like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the soon to be open steakhouse, the two chefs would end up seeing a wide assortment of women of all sizes and weights, all trying to bring their own tasty meals into the hiring contest. Taking their time, the two would eat through every meal, offering their thoughts on each meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bleh! This steak is all raw! Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... this is pretty good... for a dive bar! Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... this is actually really tasty, but not what I'm looking for since this is supposed to be a steakhouse, not a bakery. I'll call you as a first hire for if I do open a dessert place, but for now NEXT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while of tasting and stuffing themselves with multiple dishes, the two would eventually narrow down the potential chefs down to five women, all of them having a high level of skill. The first one would be a woman named Erika, who while surprisingly skinny had somehow perfected the art of cooking meat, able to give it a amazing taste simply from roasting it and giving it the most succulent of spices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up would be a rather hip-heavy Asian woman named Tsukiko, weighing about the same as Gloria but quite a bit taller at 6'0\", making her appear merely chubby rather than being full-on fat. She had brought in a succulent batch of fries, proving her skills in using a fryer properly, making it taste as if it were never fried, but still carrying the crunchy exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird would be a huge, 6'5\" woman named Emma, who was rather top heavy while carrying a rather prominent gut, looking like she would weigh more than Gloria if the two were at the same height. She admittedly had the least pleasant tastes out of the 5, but her plating skills made the food look very appetizing, which could make her be good for plating duties and serving rather than specifically just cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emma would be another skinny chef, by the name of Sasha. With Sasha though, she had brought the fifth and final chef, a rather obese chef woman by the name of Garnet with her, and the two seemed to work together as a pair of chefs. This proposition seemed to work very well, as Garnet was used to taste testing and making sure the food tasted right and Sasha could much more easily cook with her skinny frame. Together, the two were able to make possibly the best meal that the group had tried during the entire day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last batch of dishes though, the two women would lie down in their chairs, rubbing their full guts as Gloria would look to Nicole. \"Man, most of those meals were pretty garbage, but some of those people made amazing grub. That duo, Sasha and Garnet for example...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget *bwoarp* Emma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and definitely Erika too... and then there's Tsukiko... ah those fries were heavenly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscussing over the potential chefs, the two would eventually decide to call back the five women tomorrow, one at a time to discuss their deals and positions within the steakhouse. Going home for the rest of the day after looking after her other kitchens, Gloria would lie down and enjoy a bit of pizza (self made, of course), before going to rest for the night, anticipated for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Gloria would call...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria's first order of business the following day was calling Tsukiko back to her steakhouse. Being the first call of five, Tsukiko was scheduled for a late morning interview. Nicole was mildly surprised of the arrangement when Gloria told her over cappuccino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Nicole chuckled. \"Just from her fries? Although those were killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going over the footage from yesterday while prepping myself a pizza,\" Gloria began, queuing up a clip on her tablet. She and Nicole had spent the cooking audition mainly judging by results plate by plate. The new steakhouse had numerous security cameras in the house and back, ostensibly for security purposes. However, they also provided a valuable look into the applicants' preparation of their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria had built a large kitchen in the steakhouse, large enough that even dozens of corpulent chefs could work on their dishes during the waves of demonstrations. Being one of the taller heads of the new recruits, the six foot Tsukiko could be easily seen with the blue streak of hair she had in her long, tied back black locks. The kitchen was only \"just\" large enough, as there were bumps and collisions from the various cooks all competing for space and ingredients. This volume of potential talent trying to prove their best steaks might have soured some applicants' chances from all the stepping on toes and bumping of booties, yet Gloria both wanted the process done quickly and also wanted to see how well her new chefs could handle a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Nicole gasped, seeing the footage that had impressed Gloria. One of the failed tryouts and Emma, another tall cook, had ran into each other next to the spice rack as one reached for a potato peeler and Emma sought the cayenne pepper. The big and bulky Emma stood firm, causing the smaller tryout to bounce back and create a chain reaction of chefs finding their cooking interrupted. Tsukiko, on the wrong end of this accident, was just getting her fries out of the grease as a wayward collision struck her. The basket was screwed out of her hand, in all honesty the fries should have been sent to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith quick reflexes, Tsukiko caught her balance and swiftly brought the fry basket back into position, catching the batch of fries without letting one drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Ooooh!\" Nicole would often bounce in her seat or gesticulate wildly when overjoyed, her mighty hips quaking as she reacted to the video of Tuskiko's performance. \"That save! Her knife work! That dodge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, although chubby on her tall frame, Tsukiko had smooth dexterity and footwork when it came to avoid other obstacles in the kitchen that tied up other chefs in a frenzy to plate up impressive steak dinners. Rapidly chopping garlic and chives, deftly sidestepping another tryout as she took her sauce off the stove, and keeping her plate perfectly poised as the swinging door to the kitchen swung towards her violently as a crying applicant was axed, Tsukiko clearly had the moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was in the top three for steaks,\" Gloria continued her judgement. \"And while I want the best who know how to handle their meat, a steak dinner isn't a 'dinner' until you've got a good side with it. And her fries were the best, hands down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tuskiko comes out on top?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she has promise, yes. She's shown to be well rounded in the kitchen and knows how to avoid a spill. And I imagine this place to be hopping once we open up, I want those steaks coming out good and fast.\" Gloria drew up a simple hierarchy chart. \"If you're my head chef, Nicole, I want Tsukiko as your sous-chef. Everybody else answers to you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria paused to hold in a belch. \"Of course, when I'm in the kitchen I'm the number one chef, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" Nicole mock saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Vandergast?\" speaking of their star candidate, Tsukiko arrived. Poised, the moon faced applicant stood at attention in her grey chef's smock, a messy folded apron and scruffy boots; a sign of her hard work ethic, a contrast to her prim posture much like her blue streak of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsukiko, honey, you may call me Gloria,\" the franchise owner preened, although a bit miffed to be considered a 'Ms.' She was not past her prime, hell no! \"But it's boss when we're in the kitchen together, no question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss.\" Tsukiko bowed politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those fries of yours were absolutely kicker, Tsukie,\" Nicole said, already finding a nickname for her new sous-chef. \"How'd you know your way around the fryer so well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worked ten summers on my uncle's takoyaki truck when I was a teen,\" Tsukiko replied simply. \"We had a lot of fried foods on the menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's like some sort of fry-up samurai!\" Nicole giggled before Gloria shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well welcome to the team, Tsukiko,\" Gloria said. \"We're going to be frying up loads of great stuff with our steaks and you're going to be number two. Except when I reign in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much!\" Tuskiko bowed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got one change in mind on your fries before they get on the menu,\" Gloria continued, almost puffing out of her maroon suit with burgeoning authority. \"And how about you demonstrate some takoyaki and calamari. Say, four or five dozen per batch.\" A hint of drool escaped her lips as she thought about possible changes to the menu. \"Chop chop, ladies, we've got business to attend to!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Tsukiko being hired, over the course of the next few days Gloria would work through calling and hiring the other four women she found to be the best cooks, before searching out a few other of the mediocre chefs to fill out the remaining staff. While they wouldn't be as talented chefs compared to what she and Nicole were calling the \"Main Five\", they, in her own opinions, would be able to listen to their orders and at least work to the best of their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, opening night would come, and as she would try to fit herself into a fancy dress, she would make a video call to Nicole, who was already at the steakhouse preparing to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nicole...\" As she started the call, Gloria would finish getting the dress fitting, though it would look somewhat tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Gloria! Your looking a lot more fancy then usual... are you going on a night out on the town now that our Steakhouse is opening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... I'm actually heading out to the new kitchen in a bit. Don't worry, your still in charge, I'm just showing up as boss to watch business up close. I expect things to be ship-shape this first night though, gotta make sure that we bring up a amazing work effort due to our kitchen being open after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course!\" Nicole would bow a bit for the Kitchen Boss from her end, before looking to the kitchen. \"So, would you like us to make you something for when you arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... three steaks should do, with a side of fries with each steak. As for the drink... surprise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood. I'll tell Erika and Tsukiko to focus on your meal first and foremost when they get here, and I'll take to work delivering it to your table when you get here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll see you in thirty minutes then. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up, Gloria would head out on her way to Trussels from her hotel room, riding a taxi to \"Gloria's Steakhouse\" to keep herself from being noticed until she was at the very least at the kitchen itself. Getting out of the taxi, she would very quickly notice that the kitchen itself was packed almost to it's limits, leaving the boss very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in, she would quickly find herself a booth table, and as she sat down she would wait for Nicole to bring her the food she had ordered. Once the meal was placed down, she would take the glass and sip it down, not even looking at the glass before determining the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Cabernet Red... perfect. Thank you so much Nicole, expect a pay raise after this day's over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the woman walk her way back to the kitchen, her hips shaking wildly with each step, Gloria would smile a bit as she turned back to the meal she had ordered. Taking her time with each part of her big meal, she would feel a heavenly taste from the superbly cooked steak, as well as an amazing crispiness from the steak fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would not just be from Gloria that good experiences would come from though, as the Kitchen Boss would hear from the crowds and tables...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, this takoyaki is amazing! Hey, can I get another order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compliments to the chef, I've never tasted such amazing steak and fries before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, who would have thought steak could have been this good... we gotta come back here again this week hubby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, after Gloria had finished her meal, she would stay around, watching the crowd of customers up until closing. Listening to their various praises and compliments, the head chef would feel especially prideful and proud, as she had never heard such praise in any of her previously opened up restaurants. By the time the last of the customers would walk out, she would eventually walk to the back of the store, to view her now-prized chefs...</span></div></div>",

Her staff had no energy, as they had given their all to the opening night service. Now, Gloria saw that everyone was teetering around the kitchen, finding awkward places to rest, moaning like the waking dead. Walking would be too much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was barely visible. The short, thigh-expansive cook was sitting on the floor panting as she fanned herself, looking quite unprofessional compared to her role of Gloria's head chef at the newly christened steakhouse. Tsukiko, the sous chef, was leaning against an open section of tiled wall, the most nimble in the kitchen also past her limits as she had a sweat rag over her forehead as she took long sips from a cola bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma, the tallest cook given she had five inches on Tsukiko, was slumped over the prep table with dingy blonde hair falling over her face where it was tied when she had been tasked to plating and sauces. Her large, muscular yet flabby bulk filled the table between spent dishes and cookware. The skinniest chefs of the bunch, Erika and Sasha, had ended up back to back barely able to support the other upright. The red headed, highland accented Erika had assisted Tsukiko with sides, with the dark brown haired, willowy Sasha on desserts and other entrees. Rounding out the \"Main Five\" under Nicole was Sasha's partner, the incredibly obese Garnet seated up at the pass for final inspection of plates leaving the kitchen. The African-American Garnet had culinary knowledge and a sophisticated palette on par Gloria's high standards on food, given she was the brains behind her and Sasha's top tier steak dinner application. However, speed was needed in the kitchen, more than what Garnet could provide, so they had found three stools to support her enormity as she ensured quality left the kitchen. And yet she looked as sweaty as the other, more active chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the line cooks, other kitchen assistants, busboys, and waitstaff had also sought out whatever free chair or open space there was to slump exhausted. No closing procedures were underway as everyone lazed about the kitchen left messy from opening night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives?\" Gloria demanded, putting hands on her plump hips, feeling slight tension after enjoying her three steaks that night. \"We've got cleanup, closing, lockup. I want to be out of here before midnight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...boss...\" Nicole panted from the floor. \"I know we kicked ass out there...with great dinners...but I need ten minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Gloria prodded her contemporary with her shoe. \"This is the example you want to lead with? We all know it's not over until the house is shut up. There's a followup health inspection this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am,\" Tsukiko offered patiently, \"That was the biggest opening night I've ever seen. Many of us had seen. Please give us some time to recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some time to recover?\" Gloria was incredulous. \"No, you strike when the iron is hot!\" She clapped her hands for emphasis. \"We can't rest on our laurels after opening night. We need to think bigger! I want this place to be the hottest steakhouse in the city. The crowd tonight is a paltry start in comparison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paltry start?\" Erika spoke up. \"Ms Vandergast, I've worked some tough kitchen be'fore, believe me, but you cannae work us to the bone each night if this is your expect'd default. E'van with our collected talent we'll burn out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this talk,\" Gloria said, disgusted. \"I thought I was hiring the best of the best when it comes to steaks. You all sound ready to quit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quit,\" Emma said, rising up to her full height. \"We just need a quieter pace. Opening is an outlier, right? We won't always be this busy on an average day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Emma had the size to dwarf Gloria, the ambitious Kitchen Boss got right up in her face. \"Average day? That mindset doesn't led to continued excellence. There should always be room for improvement. What do you all think would improve this situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarnet raised her hand from where she was precariously perched by the pass, having found some steak tips to munch on. \"Less nights we're open a week?\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More general help,\" Sasha added, \"so we can rotate our shifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers on staff spoke up with ideas. \"Maybe an employee lounge on site where we can take our own meals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about a digital ordering system at each table to cut down on traffic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it too early to ask for a raise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" Gloria roared. \"Whose name is on the establishment again? Mine. 'Gloria's Steakhouse,' and I didn't get to this point in my career by taking it easy! By playing safe! If you've attracted the kinds of crowds we did on opening you can't lower the bar from there or you'll lose customers. No, you push it higher. Do any of you have your own restaurants? No, but I know what it takes to succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what all did yae do tonight?\" Erika scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy girls,\" Nicole finally pulled herself upright, getting as close as she could to Gloria's eye level as the head boss looked ready to commit murder. \"Tensions are just run-in' high after tonight, that's all.\" Breathing heavily, she found a scrap of remaining fries to chew as she gestured with the other fry. \"We know we can work as a team if we're all in this together, right? Nobody's saying this was a bad night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" she gave her partner a pleading look, \"Gloria, honey, you've got to cut us a little slack so we can dig in our roots. We've got a champion team in the making, I know it.\" She leaned in closer to whisper. \"But if you break them too hard, too soon, I'm not saying there's gonna be a mutiny, but things might turn ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting her breathing under control, Gloria restrained some of her spitfire vitriol. \"Alright, fine! Take what time you need to catch your breath. But this place better be spic 'n' span by the time we open tomorrow, you've got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were various murmurs of reply. If morale was going to be an issue at her new steakhouse, Gloria needed to find a solution fast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, Ms. Vandergast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's gaze swiveled to the door, where she could see her blonde-haired assistant nervously poking her head in. She hid a grimace at the younger woman's apprehension. No, that wouldn't do at all. If Danni really wanted to make a place for herself in Gloria's burgeoning empire, she would need to straighten up; literally, in this case. \"Spine straight!\" the chubby chef barked. Danni flinched at first, but quickly obeyed the order and stood up straight so fast that her chest wobbled for a bit. She still looked way too nervous, but at least she wasn't slouching now. Nodding her approval, Gloria gestured Danni to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buxom blonde was still a little apprehensive, but she spoke with a little more force than the nervous warble Gloria usually attributed to her. Good, she might just make it yet. \"I brought the files on the properties you were looking into, Ma'am. I also received a call from Ms. Harker. She said traffic is a lot heavier than she expected, and estimated that she'd be at least an hour late, maybe longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria frowned at the second bit of news, which caused Danni to flinch again. Seeing this caused Gloria to sigh; it was no use taking out her frustration on the messenger, she supposed. \"Print a second set of files for Nicole to have when she gets here. When you're done with that, start prepping the paperwork for our offers once I make a decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Ma'am. If you'll excuse me?\" With a wave of her hand, Gloria dismissed the younger woman, who left the office as quickly as she could without seeming rude. Gloria, meanwhile, began to peruse the files she'd been given. This was one of her favorite parts of the business; expansion. Every new restaurant up and running was another province in her proverbial empire, and Gloria's ambitions were not yet sated. Sadly, there was only enough money in her coffers to afford to build one new restaurant this time, so she'd need to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first location she looked at was at 101 Harbor Road. A scenic spot overlooking the nearby marina, a restaurant built there would have fantastic views of the ocean during the evening, a surefire way to draw in couples looking for a romantic evening. It would also provide a good incentive to renegotiate some contracts Gloria had with her seafood providers; since the property was right by the ocean, it would mean smaller transportation costs to get said seafood from the fishing boats over to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond in the packet was 62 Newtrail Way. The property was built at the base of a mountain that brought in hikers from around the country, and Gloria was certain that they'd enjoy having a spot to sit down and enjoy a good meal after hours of walking and thin air. At least she assumed so, since Gloria had never been one for hiking herself. The restaurant's view of the mountain might also bring in those who weren't hikers but enjoyed natural scenery to go along with their dinners (that, Gloria <b>did</b> understand).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was 555 Main Street. Instead of the views of nature, this restaurant brought with it command of the city center. Main Street ran from City Hall through the business and shopping districts on into the suburbs, with plentiful highway access throughout. Building a restaurant here might very well attract the attention of the politicians and businessmen who liked to spend big on their meals to impress the various clients, cronies, and yes-men who accompanied them. If someone was going to be receiving those big payouts, why shouldn't it be Gloria Vandergast? She was certain she could actually give them their money's worth when it came to the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was a spot at Paradigm Plaza. The Plaza was one of the biggest shopping malls in the entire city, and a magnet for youths looking for places to shop, hang out, and generally not be around their parents for as long as possible. If Gloria could hook the next generation and make one of her restaurants the place where they came when they were hungry, she could have a group of customers that kept on coming back for years and years. The tricky part would be finding the proper marketing tactic to appeal to \"the youths of today\" (Gloria grimaced again. Was she getting old? Surely not!), but she figured she'd figure something out if she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last property she wanted to look at was the most unusual by far, being the old Malanor Manor. As the story went, the house had been built by Maximilian Malanor, a businessman who had made his fortune in the railroad boom of the mid-1800s. Then one night, something had gone horribly wrong, and Maximilian and his wife Marianne, both childless, had disappeared. Rumors floated around about how the manor was haunted. Fueling those rumors was the fact that every business that had acquired the property went bankrupt not long after the sale was finalized. Gloria was not a superstitious woman, though. She made her own destiny! And having a restaurant built in a supposedly-haunted house would definitely provide an experience that none of her rivals could come close to offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest part about this whole process was the fact that she could only purchase one property at the moment. A part of Gloria was tempted to go into debt to try and snap them all up at once. But she was a student of history, and the Kitchen Boss knew that growing her empire too quickly was a recipe for disaster. No, she'd just stick to the one new property for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Nicole Harker did arrive, still rather miffed about the traffic jam that had delayed her. Her frustration was soon forgotten as the two weighty executives found themselves in a whirlwind discussion about the merits and potential pitfalls of each of the locations. It took the entire morning for them to make a decision, but as they broke for lunch, Gloria knew where the next restaurant in her empire was going to be located.</span></div></div>",

That\u2019ll certainly draw in crowds, right Gloria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the now bought property on 100 Harbor Road, Gloria and Nicole would both be observing the new locale that they now owned. They were testing every chair, trying every booth seat, and checking for any weak floorboard, in order to make sure the place they bought was actually safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, once they were done checking, aside from a squeaky board near the entrance, the place seemed to be fine. A few booth seats would need to be more spaced to allow bigger residents to sit in them, but for now the soon to be restaurant looked ready to serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that they had to decide on now was a theme though, and that would be a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think Gloria? Can we please do the beach theme? I\u2019d finally have the chance to try out this new bikini I got last year, and I won\u2019t have to wear such a restricting chef uniform...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Gloria would sigh a bit. \u201cI admit, that is somewhat of a interesting idea, but I was more thinking of a pirate theme. Would certainly help sell food with how popular they seem to be in recent years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe... but at least consider! Besides, this building\u2019s partially on the harbor, maybe if we don\u2019t do that theme we could at least have a small place in the break room to relax and swim after hours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I\u2019ll definitely do that, could use a good break after every workday myself. But as for the theme... I\u2019ll probably sleep over it, and call you back in the morning on what theme we should go with. You think that\u2019s fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the back of the kitchen as she was asked this, Nicole would sigh a bit, as she would feel the water flowing underneath the back of the store. \u201cI guess that\u2019s fair at least. So you wanna cook some early dinner with me while we finish checking this place out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her stomach growl, Gloria would only nod as the two would end up working together, cooking up with some supplies they had already brought over, cooking up some slices of salmon and shrimp into a meal fit for four. Smelling the completed meal, the two would set it down on the nearest booth before digging into it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, eventually the two would finish off this seafood platter, their stomachs stretched to their limits as they would lie down in their booth seats. Rubbing her own belly, Gloria felt happy for the first time in quite a bit, probably due to trying out some of her own food, and Nicole would seem to be in a similar state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne thing\u2019s for certain at least Nicole... the menu is definitely going to involve a bunch of seafood on top of the burgers we serve at every one of our locations. You feel okay about that at least?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, totally. Man, I haven\u2019t had popcorn shrimp in such a while but it tastes so much better than I imagine. We should eat together more often...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Helping Nicole squeeze out of her booth seat after squeaking out of it herself, Gloria would help carry her fellow chef with her out of their new location, with the intent of turning it into her next restaurant. She already had a crew in mind for this place, now all she needed was a theme...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of the next few weeks, Gloria and Nicole would eventually settle for a balance between the two ideas, having a bit of a pirate theme but allowing the chefs to still wear some less restrictive pirate-themed swimwear as they cooked as part of the theme. With everything picked out though, all that was left was to finish up the break room and everything would be ready for a grand opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking around the clock, Gloria would have some of the best workers in all of Trussel start preparing a swimming area in the personal quarters of the place. As the workers would begin cutting a hole into the floor to open up a swimming area however, the workers would text back at her, with something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFELIX: Hey Glo, something is going on at the place we\u2019re finishing our work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLORIA: What? Surely your not trying to say the pool will not work, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFELIX: Well... it would be best if you came and saw it yourself. It\u2019s... certainly unique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLORIA: ...Fine. You\u2019ve piqued my interests at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing up at the Pirate Barrel after a short drive, Gloria would look up at what a few weeks worth of construction has done to her store, before smiling. Only a few days from now this place will open, and once it does the revenue will be pouring in. If it was successful enough, she thought, it could even let her move to the nationwide market!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminding herself of what needed to be done though, Gloria would walk right in, being guided in by the construction workers into the back room, where she could see her office in all of it\u2019s glory. Not only did it have a comfy seat and a great view of a TV, but with the pool being nearby it gave off the energy of her being rich and powerful, which she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her trusted construction man Felix, Gloria would nod to him as she would look back to the pool. \u201cSo, what was it you were texting me about huh? Is there something troublesome with the pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s not about the pool itself. We can make it easy... it\u2019s just... well, look inside of it. You\u2019ll understand there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Felix points down at the pool, Gloria would look down in curiosity, seeing a strange figure swimming far down. Sticking her hand in, this figure would swim up real fast, grabbing onto Gloria\u2019s hand and trying to budge her into the water, with little avail due to Felix helping keep her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a hold of the person\u2019s hand, Gloria would pull the woman out of the water, only to jump back a bit in fright and curiosity. She seemed like a normal woman with red hair and a bit of a potbelly, but in place of legs was a sort of mermaid\u2019s tail, being like that of a swordfish\u2019s tail and flopping on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, why did you bring me out of that water? It\u2019s so hard to move with a tail like this you know...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the girl drag herself back into the pool, Gloria would sit down, by the area she was almost pulled into, and look at the mermaid, now swimming at the surface. \u201cUh... I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t expect someone like... well you. Well, my name is Gloria Vandergast, and welcome to the Pirate Bucket. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name? The name\u2019s Lindsey, just Lindsey. I\u2019m sorry for intruding, I\u2019ve gotten a bit lost and I tried getting up to the surface for help only to see this place. I don\u2019t really wanna leave here cause it looks so great, but I admit that I was a bit reckless in trying to pull you in. I just wanted to talk with someone, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit from the response, Gloria would look to the others and wave them out of the room as she would continue to talk with Lindsey. \u201cSo, your just wanting to be here? Well, this pool was originally meant for relaxation for Nicole and myself, but if you want, I can let you be here as well, on one condition...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Lindsey would cock her head to the side in confusion, as she would see Gloria let out a small smirk. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? If you want me to pay, I can do that well... as long as you can take Euros that is...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. You don\u2019t need to pay me a dime.

Miss Vandergast!\u201d wailed the almost shrill voice of Gloria\u2019s young assistant, Danni, cutting through the sublime victory that the Kitchen Boss had just secured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be so dramatic Danni, it is first thing in a morning dear\u201d<br>\r\nDespite her usual temperament that had been flexed against the unprepared supplier on the phone, Gloria had a soft spot for the young girl that dutifully organised the basic day to day scheduling of her business and was often more teasing than cruel to the blonde assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Miss, it\u2019s just...we have a problem\u201d panted Danni as she halted her trot opposite Gloria with a folder clutched tightly to her button shirt-clad chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad Danni, what\u2019s happened?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Kitchen Boss was not keen on the direction this seemed to be taking and adopted a far more imposing position within her executive chair ahead of the upcoming explaination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat absolute bitch!\u201d spat Gloria with rage in her eyes and an angry flush coating her face and cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Miss Vandergast\u201d repeated Danni for the umpteenth time as the unfortunate information had sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let me get this straight, this FORMER employee was ACTUALLY a spy and her SUPPOSED Human Resources complaint was her escape plan because she\u2019s been conducting INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni could only nod out of fear as her boss seemed to rise further from her perch far beyond her short height would suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a DISGRACE!\u201d screamed Gloria as the lavish fittings of her office rattled from the volume \u201cI paid her wages for 6 MONTHS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nodded again just hoping to ride out the storm. She had seen Gloria get angry before but this was a whole new level. After all, no one had ever gone after the Kitchen Boss\u2019s empire like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho sent her?\u201d asked Gloria with a terrifying calm after her outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not entirely clear at this point...\u201d began Danni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have some idea Danni\u201d snapped Gloria sharply as she heavily dumped herself back into her desk chair which squeaked quietly under her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively Danni almost tossed the folder she was holding towards her boss as a collection of papers slid from the confines of the wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are the most likely suspects\u201d muttered Danni quickly as she looked at her shoes wishing dearly to be dismissed, a thought that appeared to be read by her senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo, I\u2019ll call if I need you\u201d retorted Gloria with her characteristic snark as she opened the folder and began to flick through the pages presented to her.<br>\r\nDanni meanwhile turned tail and made her escape even faster than her initial entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh and five piles of varying thicknesses before her, Gloria was left with a decision she certainly hadn\u2019t expected for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell every one of these has a reason to hate me\u201d admitted Gloria, slightly self gratifying, as she glanced over each pile \u201cok, let\u2019s get started\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up was an admittedly new player but one backed by some serious culinary muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina Bianchi was the youngest daughter of the legendary Bianchi family who had dominated the Italian scene for decades and, with Gina\u2019s youthful flair, were on the rise once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild combination of Gina\u2019s raw talent in the kitchen bringing American and Mexican fusion to family tradition and the young Italian beauty\u2019s sex appeal driven social media presence was bringing in enormous crowds way beyond what her predecessors could have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer food was delicious, which Gloria knew first hand, her stunning olive tanned physique, natural beauty and flirtatious friendliness had done wonders for the chain of restaurants her family owned.<br>\r\nFired up as she was though, Gloria couldn\u2019t help but think that Gina was a ticking time bomb of genetics as every Bianchi woman was eventually cursed with a metabolic crash and calorie soaked hips to boot.<br>\r\nEven Gina\u2019s older sister Isabella, a senior by three years, had blimped at the hands of her new husband and her own sisters cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a face that Gloria did not want to see which, for anyone unfamiliar with the chiseled features and roguish stubble, was easier said than done under the red scrawls of derogatory sketches over the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake Moffatt had been Gloria\u2019s long term boyfriend in college and they had shared a like minded ambition to develop a restaurant franchise to rule the eatery district together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly though Blake had other ideas and, just before graduation, tossed Gloria to the side as his own greed and ambition outgrew his romance.<br>\r\nThat emotional kicking only motivated Gloria to make her own way in the world though and, despite her extra romantic weight, was well on the way to succeed if not for the latest espionage attempt against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpting to flip Blake\u2019s photo over having seen enough of her former flame\u2019s face for one day, Gloria moved to her third pile which wrenched an equally disgusted groan from the dark haired entrepreneur\u2019s lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLacey Lacey Lacey...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a bitch that could do some damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey Truman was, unlike the rest of the people on Gloria\u2019s desk, less of a restaurateur and more of an independent baker.<br>\r\nBritish born and a dab hand in the kitchen, Lacey was just as sweet as the mountains of confections she produced every day for an avid customer base who worshipped the ground the Lindy Bop styled chick walked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery few knew how much of a charade the cutesy style and sickly sweet attitude was though as a wickedly savage business woman hid beneath who was rumoured to be running a labour intensive \u2018apprentice scheme\u2019 that was more demoralising than beneficial for the young girls she took on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey certainly controlled her audience though with the product she was selling, not to mention her body positive spin she had taken on since packing on some pounds herself forming a fluffy hourglass figure over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her anger starting build as she stared into that sickening chubby smile painted across the brunette\u2019s face behind an outstretched tray of muffins, Gloria moved onto her next suspect who was something of a curveball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant McCray was not the ruthless businessman the others were and certainly no Gloria for that matter.<br>\r\nRather, Grant had his own little corner of the foodee empire that catered to a friendly audience that just wanted to eat and enjoy some good food,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was good at what he did and certainly fit the stereotype advising against skinny chefs but there was little form to suggest he would have a reason to directly strike out against Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said Gloria, and most everybody on the desk before her, were well aware of Grant\u2019s...preferences...towards larger women and a larger client base could play into that...<br>\r\nGloria was not entirely convinced though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought Gloria to her final, and thickest, pile of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Gina Bianchi was new on the scene, the business and family was at least familiar to Gloria.<br>\r\nThe fifth individual however was a complete dark horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie Greenway?\u201d muttered Gloria under her breath as she flicked through the papers which were, admittedly, mostly screen grabs from various social media pages showing a dark haired girl at college with blazing shoulder and thigh tattoos glimmering outside bits of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to flick through photos Gloria began to recognise details, namely the arrival of a club that she vaguely remembered as well as a stream of job adverts asking for chefs and waiting staff fo said club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmongst the photos a few faces began to pop out to Gloria too, including a motherly figured blonde with glasses, a pair of bottom heavy red headed twins and a very athletic black girl with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a strange group...\u201d thought Gloria as she came to the end of the pages, making a mental note that Natalie did appear to slowly thicken up across the board as the dates raced closer to the present.<br>\r\nAlthough she\u2019d never heard of this \u2018Nat\u2019 before, Gloria could sense ambition and that was dangerous for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another audible sigh, Gloria leant back in her chair as she began to ponder the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive suspects...but who\u2019s out to get me?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThank you everybody for coming tonight\u201d bellowed Marlon Bianchi over the gentle hum of chatter buzzing around the table before him \u201cit\u2019s a pleasure to have you all here celebrating with our sweet Gina\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reigning patriarch of the Bianchi family it had been a tough decision the day he opted to hand over the family restaurant empire to his youngest daughter.<br>\r\nMarlon had questioned whether Gina was ready at just 25 years old and if she truly understood how cut throat the industry really was but the spunky Italian girl had taken it in her stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been six months back now and the business was going from strength to strength and nobody was more proud than Marlon himself.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here she comes now!\u201d beamed the family head as his prodigal daughter hip checked the swinging kitchen door, yet another platter of food cradled in one arm as Gina slid her phone into the back pocket of her jeans as she walked towards her applauding family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh papa, stop\u201d cooed Gina with an almost blush \u201ceverybody eat before it goes cold\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways the worker\u201d chuckled Marlon as he took his seat whilst Gina sidled round him to place the meat loaded platter amongst dishes of spiced rice, rich creamy hand made pastas and tortillas as well as multiple freshly cooked pizzas according to her family\u2019s dough recipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit down Gina, you\u2019ve cooked us a feast\u201d smiled her mother, Sofia, as she watched her daughter dote over various members of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will mama, just...\u201d started Gina as she came up behind her sister Isabella with an arm around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit Gina\u201d insisted her mother with a stern look and a hand instinctively shooting to a motherly hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mama\u201d relented Gina as she took the empty seat next to Isabella, contented that everybody was filling their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done amazing sis, enjoy it\u201d purred Isabella as she hungrily filled her plate, eating as much as she placed before it reached the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Iz\u201d smiled Gina in return, placing a hand on her sister\u2019s plush thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only three years between them you would expect Gina and Isabella to share a striking resemblance but those three years and a marriage on Isabella\u2019s side had made quite the difference.<br>\r\nSee, the female Bianchi genes have quite a unique trait in that at some point or another their metabolisms fade to nothing and all that Italian home cooking takes hold of the hips and never lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo whilst Gina was quite the stunner with a svelte olive tinted figure that had served purpose in her aggressive social media presence in advertising the restaurant chain since she had taken charge of it with a large part of her client base possessing a healthy attraction to the young chef, Isabella was much more motherly in appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be more precise Isabella was knocking on the gates of 300lbs that very night in no small part to her doting husband and Gina\u2019s own cooking which was all firmly settled around her hips and ass, not to mention the plump middle that was sprouting forth too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacially the sisters were easily linked with Isabella remaining thin around the cheeks and neck but that was where the physical similarities ended.<br>\r\nThe elders weight gain did nothing to damage their relationship though and they were inseparable through each other\u2019s successes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA toast\u201d declared Marlon from the head of the table \u201cto the next generation\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god\u201d muttered Isabella under her breath as the entire family looked to her and Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust breath, it\u2019ll be over soon\u201d teased Gina as the glasses rose around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the next generation\u201d came the chorus of voices before a unified drink happened as the younger girls laughed to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you everybody\u201d began Gina, rising from her seat at that point with a delicate dab at the corner of her lips with her napkin \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am now if it wasn\u2019t for you all here and I hope to do you proud in the years to come\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a delicate rumble of acknowledgment and clapping at the sentiment as Gina smiled at the crowd of family surrounding her, instinctively putting a hand to the vibrating phone in her tight jeans pocket, knowing better than to pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, everybody eat and enjoy\u201d announced Gina as she returned to her seat, delicate decorum resuming as she took up her cutlery again in sync with the people around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou not going to say anything sis?\u201d teased Gina again, side glancing Isabella who was far too busy practically deep throating a self constructed burrito loaded with Mexican spiced meatballs and rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? No way\u201d grunted Isabella around a mouthful of food, tossing thick black curls from her face as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? No, like, baby news or something?\u201d Gina continued to tease, knowing her sister wasn\u2019t pregnant nor even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe senior Bianchi sister nearly did a spit take at that.<br>\r\n\u201cHa, I\u2019m just enjoying being married to an awesome guy right now\u201d replied Isabella with a dreamy smile \u201cthink you\u2019re closer to popping the baby news than me sis\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right\u201d smirked Gina as she delicately dug in to her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe not but it\u2019d make a change to see you pop a button or two from those skinny jeans of yours\u201d teased Isabella, returning to her food with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Phew, Isabella might get that popped button sooner than she thinks if I\u2019m not careful\u2019 moaned Gina to herself as she unlocked the door to her apartment and flicked the hallway light on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was past midnight after a long night of celebrating the family\u2019s new found success and Gina was ready to be free of day clothes and curled up in bed.<br>\r\nNot to mention she had some things to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasually discarding her boots by the door and sliding her phone from within her jeans pocket, Gina trotted towards her bedroom and began reading over her messages.<br>\r\nMost of them were standard social media notifications with most of them gushing over either pictures of Gina herself or the numerous updates about the restaurants.<br>\r\nOne though, an email to be specific, caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject line simply read \u2018GV\u2019 and was from a garbled address that Gina was familiar with.<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t been easy getting Fiona into Gloria Vandergast\u2019s operation Gina knew something had to be done to get an edge on her biggest competition.<br>\r\nAfter all her father had spent long enough lecturing her on the ruthless nature of business so she had to put the lesson to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe email was a simple link that led to an encrypted drop box containing a combination of audio files, videos, photos and a document containing brief notes about what the rest of the files were.<br>\r\nMost of it would have to wait until the morning but Gina had enough energy in her to skim through the notes to get the gist of what Fiona had found whilst undercover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of it was standard \u2018chef stuff\u2019 in the form of new recipes that Gloria had concocted which were too dangerous to risk copying, Vandergast would know for sure then, but most promising was Gloria\u2019s expansion plans for her empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh boy, that could be a problem\u2019 thought Gina as she discarded her phone along with the rest of her clothes aside from her underwear as she disappeared into the soft bedding she had been craving for the past few hours, wriggling her narrow hips in between the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019ll find a way\u2019 Gina told herself \u2018papa always said that Bianchi\u2019s find a way\u2019<br>\r\nThe reassuring thoughts were the last thing crossing her mind as she fell asleep, her business mind subconsciously ticking away as she fell into a gentle sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a good night's sleep following the big announcement dinner of her fully inheriting the Bianchi family enterprises, Gina had dreamt up some schemes to block Gloria Vandergast's efforts while furthering the family's brand. Partial to Turkish coffee when she was brainstorming big plans, Gina placed a few calls while her coffee warmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciao, Fiona,\" Gina greeted to her co-conspirator. \"Yes, I know you said no further calls but don't worry, I'm calling from a burner phone. I wanted to ask you about those properties listed in the files. Just how much was her bid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some brief minutes of terse talk, Gina had the further intel she needed as her coffee had finished brewing. Dressed only in her bathrobe, the Italian belle took her coffee out to her apartment's balcony overlooking the central courtyard. The Mediterranean fresco design and roof tiles of the apartment complex had reminded Gina of her family's ancestral home when she was first looking for her own home. She took aim with the burner phone and hurled it into the courtyard fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, <i>~sorry Fernando~</i>\" she giggled to herself, as the groundskeeper would have to fish that out at some point. Reclining on her patio furniture, Gina savored a sip of her strong coffee as she made a string of other calls throughout the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Papa!\" Went the first call. \"I know it might be gauche talking business so soon, but I wanted to make sure we had the funds set aside for that planned expansion. I think we should move up the timing...\" The Bianchi holdings, while renowned, were surprisingly small compared to the fast franchising moving of Gina's generation. There was the historic original family restaurant, the second location much like the first, the third where Gina had started out cooking with her fusion cuisines, and the fourth was the eatery of an old town grocery store. Marlon, one for family and communal ties, had been unsure about aggressive expansion of the family restaurants but Gina knew just how to twist him around her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey Iz~!\" Went the second call. \"Aww, your fat pants aren't fitting? I'm shocked,\" she teased, as her sister Izabella had been just under 300 lbs before the amount she had eaten last night. \"Listen, sis, we can talk sisterly woes later, I've got a question for your hubby Benito. Hush, I wouldn't dream of it, you know he loves every fiber of your being! Enough teasing, I actually wanted to ask about his friends on the building contractors' Union...\" Benito, Izabella's darling husband, certainly had a hand in her growing size beyond the family's cooking. As a construction worker, after a hard day of working with boards, nails, I-beams and concrete, he loved coming home to a plush wife. The sisters were so close that they teased each other relentlessly and were openly candid about their respective love lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, is this the Huerta residence?\" Went the third call. \"I'm calling about your recent sale. My name is Gina Bianchi. Yes, Marlon Bianchi's daughter, I've recently picked up the reigns of the family business...oh, your grandkids were at the event? Wonderful! Family is important to me, and I've heard yours is in a spot of trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria Vandergast did not need this week to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath of the corporate spy discovery, Gloria had yet to determine who had wronged her and nothing appeared to be going right. She had her hunches but no proof, just a series of <i>conveniently</i> timed obstacles to the growth of her restaurant empire. Monday's revelation was followed by bad news on Tuesday; Gloria had been out-bid in a prime land scale from the city recently commercializing some undeveloped land. Wednesday's woe had the workforce renovating her original bistro after an 'accidental' fire (ostensibly for insurance purposes) walk-out on strike as she apparently hadn't filled the right union paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday was proving to be just as terrible. For Gloria's diet, that is. The stress of finding her plans for expansion foiled, obviously the work of whoever got that stooge hired at main restaurant for half a year, had gotten Gloria on a fast food kick. No, she wasn't buying fast food, she was making it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria had never 'eaten out' since she she had become a big name chef, unless it was for business reasons like sussing out the competition. Becoming a bit of a snob about her food, she wouldn't eat anything she didn't have a hand in nor that of her own talent. So as  she was driving her cobalt Jaguar out to the site of her next meeting, wearing her designer sunglasses and a navy suit, she was eating her concoction of a Wendy's Baconator combo meal. That being: a triple patty gourmet burger with jalape\u00f1o bacon and garlic aioli mayo; truffle oil double-crunch fries with rosemary; and a horchata-milkshake. The 84 oz Pepsi was store bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I've still got the Huerta property in my clutches,\" Gloria mused as she parked her car, inhaling the last bite of her burger. Crushing the wrapper she had gotten for it, Gloria checked herself in the mirror for any signs of spilled food on her suit. Seeing none and nursing a long swig of horchata-shake, she got out of the car with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasa Su Vecindario was a mom and pop Mexican restaurant that had fallen on hard times, owing to an unfavorable market shift. Most of the old neighborhood had dried up as department brand stores and a mega mall off the interstate drew the crowds out of the area. The family that ran the restaurant, the Huertas, could no longer afford to run the restaurant given a price hike in ingredients. Having discovered this fruitful opportunity, Gloria had intimidated the Huertas into a private sale. What she promised them was an absolute steal from her perspective. She had ambitions for an experimental Tex-Mex joint to replace it, heavy emphasis on the Tex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola, Se\u00f1or Huerta,\" Gloria greeted, eager to get the papers signed over. Upon removing her sunglasses as she entered the empty restaurant, there was an unexpected fresh face standing next to the aged owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you're Gloria Vandergast!\" Gina Bianchi had opted for a low cut but tasteful pinstripe business dress that accentuated her sleek, sexy curves. The olive-skinned Italian bombshell was all smiles to the heftier Gloria's simmering hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gina Bianchi,\" Gloria returned the false pleasantries. \"Heard you just stepped up into the big leagues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I've seen bigger,\" Gina had a private chuckle at the thought of how her sister outweighed the dumpy physiqued Gloria by a hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling insulted, Gloria addressed Oscar Huerta. \"If she's offering to buy your place, remember that she's young blood to the game. I doubt without her family's constant support she'll keep a new restaurant open more than two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not trying to buy Casa Su Vecindario,\" Gina said. \"I'm the Huerta family's new business partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught Gloria completely off guard. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar nodded along with Gina's assessment. \"Senoirta Bianchi wanted to sponsor the restaurant in trust. Our grandchildren have been inspired by her recent success and want to keep the restaurant in the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I provide them some fresh recipes and initial support staff until they create their own crew,\" Gina smiled. Latin cuisine was her favorite after that of her Italian heritage, a cornerstone of her Americana inspired fusion dishes. \"So we figured our first order of business would be telling you in person that the Huerta family rejects your offer of sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria had just enough composure to leave the disastrous meeting on civil terms, although she was all rants and rage when she returned to her Jaguar. Stuffing fries into her face, Gloria placed a call to her home office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the Bianchi Bitch!\" Gloria fumed, having found her saboteur. \"I want everything that can be dug up on her unearthed! I want horrid reviews on all her eateries! I want her head on a pike!\" The last demand was hopefully hyperbole. \"She's going to to rue the day she messed with Gloria Vandergast! SHIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdded to Thursday's troubles, Gloria now had to contend with getting Pepsi stains out of her car mats.</span></div></div>",

Aside from his prolific critics column her father had warned her against the often cutting food critic and how his written words had ended chef\u2019s with years of experience.<br>\r\nSix months in seemed like a perfect time to cross that bridge if not coincidental given her meeting with Gloria the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gina seated Vincent in a quiet corner of the restaurant she stepped herself in front of the critic where his eyes immediately drew to the young woman\u2019s exposed middle where her shirt was tied up under her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I get for you ton...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that dress code fitting of health regulations in this city Miss Bianchi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh erm yes, we\u2019re fully checked out here, I actually have a really good relationship with...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, well in that case I will have some of that signature Bianchi pasta\u201d retorted Vincent, not even glancing over a menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing right up Signore\u201d smiled Gina as she practically ran back to the kitchen, a flash of panic on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit Iz, Scrowler is here!\u201d hissed Gina into her phone, ducked behind the fridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d grunted Isabella clearly eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food critic papa always spoke about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh! You ok?\u201d swallowed Isabella realising the gravity of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m freaking out and he wants papa\u2019s special pasta!\u201d hissed Gina again, glancing round as her kitchen continued to work busily around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then make it, you can do that dish blindfolded\u201d reassured Isabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess...it\u2019s got to be that Vandergast woman though\u201d resigned Gina, wondering if she\u2019d pushed too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? Well screw her, you got this!\u201d urged the older sister \u201cbesides, Benito has you covered with the other plan so she can\u2019t touch that, just cook your little ass off tonight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina breathed heavily before standing up straight.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, thanks Iz\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet, now go make some pasta\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small smirk Gina shoved her phone away and, with a determined stride untied her shirt allowing it to tumble back over her olive tanned stomach as she swiped up a pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Danni\u201d purred Gloria as she strutted past her assistant, pushing her office doors open with a smile in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood...morning?\u201d<br>\r\nDanni was confused, the sudden mood change with her boss was unsettling after the days of foul mood but then, it was Wednesday which everybody in the food industry knew was Scrowler\u2019s Scrawlings day; Vincent Scrowler\u2019s food critic column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanni darling, has the paper come in yet?\u201d cooed Gloria from her desk, her seat groaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, yes! Yes it has\u201d replied Danni leaping from her own desk with the smoothly folded paper in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow wonderful\u201d purred Gloria as she gleefully stared at the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go Miss\u201d Danni cautiously offered as she placed the paper on the desk before her boss \u201cshall I get your morning coffee now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes please Danni\u201d replied Gloria, not really listening as she started flicking through the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni walked away with an almost smile on her slightly chubby face, was today going to be a good day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young assistant had been gone all of 3 minutes and 52 seconds when that estimation had gone down the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat absolute waste of...oh I\u2019m gonna...where\u2019s my...DANNI!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Vandergast?\u201d meekly asked Danni with a coffee cup in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t you Miss...just listen to this\u201d spat Gloria, eyes wide and wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Despite a sudden and unexpected change in leadership, the Bianchi chain has not lost any of its family orientated charm. Whilst Gina Bianchi, the new \u2018don\u2019 of the chain, may be slightly unconventional in her business model which anybody on social media and other such modern outlets will know and attest to, she has not lost what was at the heart of the family restaurants; food. Whilst I may spend hours waxing lyrical about the delectable culinary delights I was honoured with during my visit I shall do no such thing and instead urge any and everyone to visit and enjoy what young Gina Bianchi has to offer.<br>\r\nI await the opportunity to return as well as visit Miss Bianchi\u2019s newest venture due to open soon\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not...\u201d started Danni before being screamed into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DESTROY HER!\u201d screamed Gloria with a pulsating vein in her forehead \u201cget him on the phone now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nodded fearfully as she disappeared back to her desk to make the call.<br>\r\nStill fuming, Gloria\u2019s eyes snapped to the phone when it rang before snatching it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you playing at! I asked you to tear her a new one and THIS is what I get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Gloria\u201d sneered Vincent with genuine disdain this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you...hngh...and why have you endorsed her new venture?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she deserved it Gloria and I advise you to leave the girl alone\u201d retorted Vincent \u201cshe is a talent that you can\u2019t bully out\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you just wa...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEEEP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon of a...what Danni?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nearly jumped out of her skin as her boss turned on her so viciously.<br>\r\n\u201cTh...the...the mail is here\u201d declared the blonde as she dropped it down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glare was enough to send Danni scuttling out as Gloria tore open the large envelope and yanked the documents out.<br>\r\nIt was a planning application, that was clear, but a delicately hand written note was stuck to the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You didn\u2019t think the Huerta\u2019s were my only plan did you? GB X\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria angrily flicked through the pages to see a neo-classical masterpiece of architecture with high occupancy and a state of the art kitchen.<br>\r\nPractically frothing at the mouth Gloria reached the back page where another note was stuck with a picture attached with Gina shaking hands with an unknown individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018By the way, this is all legit so don\u2019t even think about it\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother FU...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Gina was jealous of the genuine nature of her sister\u2019s marriage whilst her own love life was usually more superficial with men usually just fawning over her looks.<br>\r\nWhilst not interested in gaining weight, and certainly not to the extent that Izzy had, the couple before her certainly sold the concept as appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night rolled on as the three people chatted and ate and drank a suitably copious amount of wine which inevitably led to giddiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine that Gloria woman when you push her out of the industry Gina\u201d mused Isabella, still putting away plates of food long after Gina and Benito had finished eating.<br>\r\nThe fact she\u2019d had to undo her belt and allow her bulging belly to rest free of denim on her lap suggested Isabella herself maybe should stop but her appetite ran as deep as Gina\u2019s culinary talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Iz\u201d purred Gina having reclined in her chair to enjoy her wine \u201cit\u2019s still early days yet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo cynical, you know Gina you should really BUUUURP\u201d belched Isabella, causing her to flush slightly as a hand shot to her belly, softly sinking into the sun kissed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d teased Gina, trying not to laugh by biting her lip whilst Benito snuggled against his wife, kissing her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shush, like you\u2019ve never burped before\u201d complained Isabella as she rested against Benito, taking his hand and placing it on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ve got me there\u201d admitted Gina as she continued to sip on her wine \u201cseriously though, you think I can beat Gloria? Even when she tried to get us shut down with Scrowler?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClearly didn\u2019t work though right?\u201d replied Benito having read the review the critic had written after his impromptu visit, which had been distributed around as many colleagues and clients the labourer could get it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose\u201d murmured Gina as she recalled the glowing endorsement Scrowler had given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, all your food is better than anything SHE could produce even on her best day\u201d interjected Isabella, idly massaging her own bloated belly alongside her husband\u2019s efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think?\u201d asked Gina, trying not to sound too shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLover boy here didn\u2019t marry me because your food made me sick sis\u201d matter of factly declared Isabella with a proud and knowing jiggle of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right\u201d thought Gina as she sipped at her drink.<br>\r\n\u2018Hmmm, more wine needed\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is\u201d slurred Isabella as she wiped a chocolate smear from her lips with the back of her hand \u201cis Gloria\u2019s sister as fat as me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina looked her sister up and down before relenting a tipsy nod from behind her glass.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if she has a sister\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then she definitely isn\u2019t fatter than me\u201d asserted Isabella \u201cand all good chefs need a fat sister\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the sayings about chefs that one didn\u2019t ring a bell with Gina but who was she to argue with her most loyal customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it about time you ladies got some sleep?\u201d suggested Benito with a cup of coffee in hand having opted out of continuing to drink some time back whilst the girls carried on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u201d sighed Isabella \u201chelp me up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenito sighed with a smirk before setting his coffee down and making his way round to his wife, taking her hands in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on babe, pull!\u201d groaned Isabella as she laboriously rocked in her seat.<br>\r\nBenito didn\u2019t respond, instead giving a more forceful pull which did the trick of bringing Isabella to her feet causing her whole body to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery inch a Bianchi woman, Isabella\u2019s hips spread wide on her figure even whilst stood with fat thighs wedged together in her tight jeans whilst a smooth roll of belly fat hung over the waistband of said jeans, holding them up in their unbuttoned and unbelted state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey ten bucks say you can\u2019t button them\u201d teased Gina, resting herself on all fours over the arm of the sofa as she looked over her sister\u2019s hulking midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on\u201d accepted Isabella as she reached under her belly to grab the two flaps of material trapped there before pulling them up over said gut ahead of trying to pull them together.<br>\r\nThe Herculean task proving to be just that as the rolls of flesh squeezed together and against themselves in great bulges, a stretching belly button mocking the open air as denim refused to meet denim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though...<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh fine, you win\u201d relented the older and larger Bianchi sister as she let go off the flaps, allowing her belly to sag back to its original place against her bulbous thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina laughed in her victory as she jumped up from her seat and strutted her skinny self past her sister towards the guest room where she stayed whenever she cooked for her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne day this\u2019ll be you Gina\u201d Isabella three after her sister in a mock sulk that was only appreciated by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure it will\u201d mused Gina with a toothbrush sticking out of her mouth and a coy tipsy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just wait then me AND mama will both laugh\u201d teased Isabella as she waddled past the open door to Gina\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou keep telling yourself that sis\u201d purred Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I will\u201d replied Isabella with a smile \u201cnow if only we had a third sister that cooked even better than you and got you to taste test everything\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what Iz\u201d announced Gina, lounging against the doorframe of her room, her shirt rising over her flat stomach as she spoke \u201cyou learn to cook and I\u2019ll taste test EVERYTHING\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal\u201d cheered Isabella as she closed her bedroom door with muffled sweet nothings been fired her way.<br>\r\nCollapsing back into the large guest bed Gina stared up at the ceiling with her fingers interlinked over her stomach.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think I can kick her ass now\u201d she quietly pondered as she mentally ran over her business plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Yep, Gloria won\u2019t know what hit her\u2019 Gina thought as she curled up to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, compared to the lovely night shared by the siblings (-in-law) in the Bianchi / Molina family, across the city of Trussel Gina's newfound rival was spending the night alone. Burning the midnight oil with a mix of seething hatred and dark ambition, Gloria kept the lights on in the bedroom of her penthouse suite as she looked through social media feeds on her computer. Her only companion a rapidly depleting chocolate-mocha mousse by her nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she this successful?\" Gloria said sourly, every picture of Gina the Italian bombshell had posted online making the side-lined entrepreneur loathe her even more. Not that Gloria had even been this skinny in her life but she would have killed, at that moment, for as sexy of curves as the young Bianchi chef. Or hell, if Gloria's size could be seen as sexy. She sort of missed the movement of body-positivity sex appeal that graced some of her other culinary big named (&amp; big-framed) peers. Truthfully, it was less Gloria's physique but rather her acidic personality that kept her from getting the most out of her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet photo after photo of Gina Bianchi, getting a feel for her life, was like another insult from this fresh faced upstart that had laid waste to her plans. Photos from the relaunch of the family restaurant when Gina took the reigns. Dockside photos from the fish market and the family yacht. That time she was dating a Hollywood producer. Canid snapshots from Gina's interviews on all the big name culinary magazines. And most recently, photos with her new partners the Heurta family for the revamping of Casa Su Vicindario and the groundbreaking of her next big restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it her pinstripe suits, fashionable looks or grunge wear for physical labor, Gina Bianchi was the 'femme' of a femme fatale natural beauty knockout, with her sun-kissed olive skin and sleek curves. Hell, her hair looked great even when she was chipping in painting the Mexican restaurant she swiped from under Gloria's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all of her flake fans are just in love with her locks,\" Gloria commented on the comments surrounding these photos, too cynical to believe Gina's adoring fans loved her for her personality beyond her sultry looks. Her spoon scraping the bottom of her mousse, the scheming Kitchen Boss tried to think up a way to get back at Gina. The Bianchi family had been a big name in local business, of course, yet not one Gloria had considered a threat to her market. Up until Gina had showed up on the scene with the audacity to do tow-to-tow with Gloria and win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to destroy her,\" Gloria grumbled, taking a break aware from the madness of hate-following her rival on social media to finish getting ready for bed. Clade in silk pajamas in gaudy tiger print, the hefty Gloria pieced together half-baked revenge schemes as she went about her nightly constitutional, the sting of her mouthwash matching her ill-will towards Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who knew Gloria best, such as her sister, coworkers and friends, would have advised her to take a step back. To not obsess over Gina and stick to her guns. Normally, that was the trick to keep Gloria from setting her sights on eliminating a rival to the bane of actually running her enterprises. To be crude, Gloria having a dry spell in her sex life probably didn't help matters either. A good fuck would probably do wonders for her mood, outlook &amp; expertise. It would certainly take her mind off of things, rather then dropping back down the social media rabbit hole as she settled back into bed with her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How to ruin her imagine?\" Gloria repeated, her oft repeated mantra this night as she shot daggers at the imagines of her rival. Going back to the media blitz about the change of reigns for the Bianchi family business, Gloria keyed in on the older sister, Izabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't hide a whale like that from the camera, especially one with almost a hundred pounds on Gloria. Obviously, most of the attention was on the bombshell Bianchi babe but her sister was hard to miss. With a large stomach and gigantic ass, in another life Izabella would have been the patron customer of any of Gloria's eateries, given how much she obviously loved her sister's food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded of the Bianchi woman phenotype, Gloria shifted attention to background shots of the two sisters' parents. Sofia Bianchi was no slouch in the backside department either. A short trawl through publicly available genealogy records showcased that all of the Bianchi women, back to the original immigrants to America and another branch in the home country, sported the hereditary genes for weighty buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut back to the present, another look at one of Gina's pics in her power-grabbing, sexily cut pinstripe suit. Not large enough up top to truly be considered an hourglass, although her budding Bianchi rump was tastefully full yet slim compared to the zaftig size of her mother, sister and cousins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a metabolic crash waiting to happen,\" Gloria mused, easing off into fitful sleep with dreams about how to knock Gina out of the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Danni,\" Gloria greeted the next morning to her personal secretary as she reached her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Good Morning, Ms Vandergast,\" Danni said, somewhat taken aback. Since the buxom blonde had come under Gloria's employ, true pleasantries were not present in her boss's typical mood. Not without some nefarious motive or power-grab behind them. As the last few days had be rife with Gloria's outbursts at being shown up by Gina Bianchi and the failed attempts to badmouth her business, Danni was prepared to buckle down for the inevitable Hurricane Gloria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite unlike the meteoritical catastrophe Danni used as a metaphor for her boss's mood, Ms. Vandergast hummed a little ditty to herself, thanked Danni for her morning cappuccino &amp; pastry sampler, and even took time to read the comics page of the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're alright, Ms. Vandergast?\" Danni asked some time later, with the unknown about what Gloria could possibly be planning weighing heavily on her mind from head to padded rump before she just had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better, Danni.\" Gloria smiled. \"Just savoring the anticipation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anticipation?\" Her bombshell secretary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If only Gina was as easy to manipulate as Danni</i>, Gloria mused as she glanced to her curvaceous yet skittish administrative assistant. Danni had a head for numbers and business, the backbone to some of Gloria's loftier ambitions, and without being too biased, more pinup worthy than Gina given Danni had a rack to go with her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Bianchi has everything I would have wanted five years ago,\" Gloria explained. \"Minus the old family money, niche cuisine and the boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, don't quite follow.\" Danni said, adjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The biggest thing Gina has going for her,\" Gloria continued, \"minus the family connections, is all this great publicity she gets her direction. She's like some sort of movie starlet, makeup never out of place and a radiant glow whether at the spa or construction site, on top of her skills as a chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is quite the natural beauty, yes,\" Danni replied, thoroughly confused by this line of logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A social media princess clamored by legions of fans,\" Gloria surmised. \"And we're going to shake that confidence from her by sullying her image to all those followers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the inane plans she'd heard Gloria come up with, this one absolutely bamboozled Danni. \"How exactly do you go about showing her up in front of all her fans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria merely grinned, laying out the stages of her plan whipped up from last night's fever dream. (Mayhaps the cream in her midnight mousse had been sour?)</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s go get make overs and then you'll see it\u201d offered Gloria, grabbing Danni\u2019s hand and dragging her through the store, the blonde tottering behind on heels she was not used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVandergast, you know my account and send the rest of the outfits to my office\u201d shot Gloria as they passed the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Miss Vandergast, what would you say is your driving force today?\u201d asked one reporter, thrusting a dictaphone at Gloria in preparation for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell business is a vicious animal and just that thrill of wrestling with it every day is the zip that I need\u201d replied Gloria with a sickly grin and hands on hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about the competition?\u201d asked another reporter, the pointedness of the question instantly riling Gloria up internally, even if she managed to -mostly- remain composed externally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, could you repeat that?\u201d asked Gloria, taking a moment to swallow her rage having perfectly understood the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean people like Gina Bianchi, she\u2019s been taking the city by storm right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for sure, Gina is great at what she does and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello everybody\u201d came a sweet voice from behind the gathered press conference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft mumble asking who the individual was washed through the gathering whilst Gloria smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry I\u2019m late Miss Vandergast\u201d giggled Danni as she weaved her way through the crowd with all eyes on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Danni, get up here though so we can get some photos together\u201d<br>\r\nDanni trotted up to the front and slid up next to Gloria with all jaws firmly on the floor as the blonde secretary smiled for the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst her dress up session had consisted of dresses and more formal wear, once Gloria had keyed into Danni\u2019s clothes size it was just a case of flicking through the catalogues and matching with anything Little Miss Bianchi would wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular occasion, Danni was dressed almost casually with a snug crop top that really made her chest pop with a valley of cleavage and some high waisted jeans that accented her bulging rear assets.<br>\r\nThe outfit was topped off with some open toed strappy sandals, a long pony tail trailing between her shoulder blades and of course her signature red framed glasses with matching painted nails throughout.<br>\r\nDanni could have done without the exposed midriff Gloria had insisted was essential but it seemed nobody but her cared about that particular aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow as some of you know I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today without my amazing assistant and, of course, I am eternally grateful for everything that Danni does\u201d beamed Gloria, an arm snaked around her assistant\u2019s shapely hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Miss Vandergast, I\u2019m just pleased to work with an amazing chef and all the...perks that come with that\u201d cooed Danni, throwing a side glance over her glasses with a hand holding a flicked hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince their outing to buy Danni some more appropriate outfits, Gloria had spent time teaching Danni how to be the promiscuous little honey she needed her to be.<br>\r\nAnd the media was eating it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which how about we open up the buffet for our guests Danni?\u201d asked Gloria, steering the situation back to where it needed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh absolutely\u201d smiled Danni, strutting towards a covered table \u201cdon\u2019t forget, leave feedback about your favourites\u201d<br>\r\nIn one swift motion Danni removed the cloth to reveal an extensive spread of Gloria\u2019s most delicious canap\u00e9s and finger foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gaggle of reporters descended on the table, Danni drifted away back to Gloria\u2019s side and watched over the spectacle.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think this was a success Miss?\u201d asked Danni<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think YOU were a success\u201d smirked Gloria, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Danni, over here!\u201d cried out one reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s you\u2019re favourite meal Danni?\u201d called out another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFancy sharing a bite Danni?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sounds like you have an audience Danni\u201d ushered Gloria as she stood back and watched the blonde girl get absorbed into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina was rushing back and forth from her kitchen feeding the last of the evening rush, something which had grown considerably since her brush with Vincent Scrowler.<br>\r\nWith one last swing of the doors and a deep breath Gina wiped her hands on her apron before taking a seat.<br>\r\n\u201cAnother good night\u201d whispered Gina, looking over her empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the silence of the kitchen Gina could hear a faint buzzing coming from her locker.<br>\r\n\u201cWonder who that could be\u201d muttered Gina as she climbed out of her seat and went to collect her phone.<br>\r\nBy the time she got there it had rung off but a lone buzz indicated she had just received a message from, of course, Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to look at this sis\u2019 read the message with an accompanying link.<br>\r\nGina immediately opened the link and she couldn\u2019t quite comprehend what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this Iz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d laughed Izabella<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long shift Iz, short answers please\u201d grouches Gina a little sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got her assistant to be all \u2018social media popular\u2019\u201d snorted the older Bianchi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Gina really was struggling to keep up and trudged back to her seat, brow furrowed with fingers massaging temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, simple Gina needs simple words\u201d mocked Izzy \u201cVandergast has got her poor bullied assistant playing the popularity contest, look at the pictures again\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGina opened the article again and looked through the pictures.<br>\r\nSure, Gloria\u2019s assistant was pretty but she was no Gina when it come to the dressing department or the Instagram poses for that matter.<br>\r\nAwkward pose after awkward pose with the camera filled with cleavage or uncomfortable attempts to ooze sexuality with various food items in her mouth, the impersonation suddenly became clear to Gina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe really thinks that\u2019s the way to win this now?\u201d laughed Gina with an air of tiredness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, apparently so\u201d snorted Izabella again \u201cand on that note you are clearly tired and need to get some sleep so I will speak to you tomorrow\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, night Iz\u201d mused Gina, A\u2019s she began to tidy up for the night ahead of leaving.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThese will bake for 20 minutes, which is when I make the icing. But we\u2019re only baking the muffins right now,\u201d Lacey Truman walked backwards along the faux-kitchen\u2019s island to tilt a plate of finished muffins for the cameras. \u201cThis is what they\u2019ll look like when finished. As you can see, I\u2019ve added the icing and a light dusting of lemon peel shavings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for those with limited time for the kitchen, I am excited to announce that my bakeries will be selling our unique line of icings in the fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow exciting,\u201d the morning show hostess said as she accepted a finished muffing from Lacey. \u201cWill this include the chocolate raspberry? That\u2019s a personal favorite of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine as well, as well as most customers,\u201d Lacey smiled. \u201cI spent over three weeks getting the blend of sweetness and tartness just right, perfectionist that I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yes, that will be one of our introductory flavors, along with pineapple-coconut, French vanilla, blueberry-lemonade and the Yankee autumn tradition: pumpkin spice. But with an added twist, which I won\u2019t spoil just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the camera while keeping her head mostly turned to the morning show hostess, Lacey put a finger to her lips and smiled. Beside her, the hostess took a bite of the muffin and moaned audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm. So good. This would go perfectly with a,\u201d here she put on an atrocious British accent, \u201cspot of tea, eh guvnor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey\u2019s camera-ready smile did not change, it simply mutated from the traditional audience-friendly warmth to a forced pleasantness. Oh, these insipid Americans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she made herself titter bubbly for a second, and then the brunette baker took a hefty bite of her own confection, her teeth sinking into the chocolate-banana muffin with relish as she maintained eye contact with the hostess. \u201cPerhaps I should look into creating a line of house teas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe segment was wrapped up moments later, the hostess giving Lacey\u2019s bakeries an enthusiastic plug. Off-camera Lacey\u2019s assistant mimicked bowing slightly, squeezing her shoulders in to emphasize a pair of breasts she did not have. Spying her, the British expat smiled for the camera and leaned forward her ample chest straining against her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloaking her recent weight gain in the trendy air of \u2018body positivity\u2019 was still new for Lacey, and sometimes she needed to be reminded to let shine her burgeoning portliness instead of hiding it behind black clothes and vertical lines. She had overruled her assistant\u2019s suggestion to wear the blue and white blouse that made her potbelly appear bigger, no matter how much it would make her relatable to the housewives tuning in, but playing up her heavy breasts (she was approaching E-cups now, and would probably need new bras before the season was out) and hip-hop music video-ready behind allowed her to indulge in feeling sexy while also convincing her target demographic she was one of them in body if not mind and spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This form of abundance wouldn\u2019t have been appreciated back home,\u2019 she thought to herself after the cameras cut away and she was free to exit the studio. But not before grabbing a muffin; just one, unfortunately, as the hostess (Lacey had already forgotten her name) asked if she could take the others to share with the rest of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs certain as she was that the hostess would hoard them all as she was planning to do herself, Lacey smiled sweetly and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t keen on giving up food for free, but by thinking of it as one last part of the free publicity this morning\u2019s segment would give her bakeries, it was worth the cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, there would be a full plate of muffins waiting for her back at her office. If her new apprentice knew what was good for her, at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA perfect presentation,\u201d Lacey\u2019s assistant said, falling into step just behind her boss. The brunette Brit could feel the other woman\u2019s eyes on her pencil skirt-clad rear, but being ogled bothered her less than the pointless flattery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it was perfect,\u201d the baker responded, dropping her British accent to its naturally low levels. Years of traveling the world, honing her baking skills at the best kitchens in France, Italy and elsewhere had smoothed her once coarse accent (don\u2019t call it Cockney, more than one prospective apprentice had learned too late), but she could whip out a posh inflection whenever it suited her. And when dealing with Yanks easily impressed by a whiff of British aristocracy, it suited her often. \u201cDo you think I needed to call upon any reserve of my talent to impress Betty Homemaker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the studio proper, she continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall ahead to the Tristan Avenue location and tell them to prepare a box of three apple fritters, four raspberry glazed doughnuts, a pair of pecan tarts and a pair of orange cranberry muffins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into Lacey\u2019s chauffeured car and returned to her office with a stop at one of her signature bakeries. There were five in the city, soon to be six, and every day Lacey made a spot pick-up at a random one to test the wares of her business. Her assistant knew to not bother her with other matters until after she had sampled each piece and made her judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat she had ordered multiples of each item was not in itself a sign that she expected the Tristan location to pass with flying colors; one part of her testing was to sample more than one piece of each selection, to check for consistent quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other fact was that Lacey had always had a healthy sweet tooth, and even less-than-perfect sweets were good enough for her most any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assortment today did pass muster, Lacey giving her assistant mostly positive notes and even the criticisms easy fixes rather than outright errors. They were small things the average consumer would not pick up on, but Lacey\u2019s palate was so refined a little too much sugar or a little too much salt would stand out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as impressive was her knowledge of her employee roster. Even with almost half a dozen locations with 10-15 employees each, she knew every employee\u2019s schedule, how they worked together, and what to expect from their labors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, for example, she knew the manager at the Tristan location had a hands off approach to production in the kitchen, but considering the talent and experience of the two main bakers on hand that was acceptable. On the other hand, the Ridgeway Drive location\u2019s manager today was a strict backseat baker, always keeping one eye on the inexperienced bakers under her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Might do to make a surprise visit there around noon,\u2019 Lacey thought to herself. \u2018See if they\u2019ve gotten up to snuff with the red velvet cake recipe.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCritiquing done, she gobbled up the remainder in as ladylike a fashion as she could manage, finishing just before they arrived at her office located in the same building as her first bakery.</span></div></div>",

Shall I call her in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. Summon Alicia, and tell her to bring a tray of apple cinnamon muffins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Her assistant did not remark that for the past couple days Lacey had been putting the apprentice through the wringer on her bran muffins, and would almost certainly have a plate of those ready. She was used to her boss keeping her apprentices on their toes like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey got comfortable in her seat, unzipping her skirt and letting her belly spread free. It was bigger than ever, and that couldn\u2019t be chalked up entirely to all the sweets she had eaten today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was getting fat. It had always been inevitable. Genetics were going to make her soft and round no matter what, and her sweet tooth, which had made her a success with her bakeries and soon to roll out make-at-home line of treats, would only compound that. It was something Lacey had grappled with for years, her resolve wearing down only as the benefits became apparent. Her thick hourglass figure was undeniably sexy, and people trusted overweight people more than skinny people. And a baker needed people\u2019s trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer assistant came into her office a minute later, Lacey pulling her blouse down to make sure her belly was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlicia will have the muffins ready in 15 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d They weren\u2019t ready yet, so she hadn\u2019t anticipated what Lacey would be in the mood for. That was all right. More important was that she had been ready to dive into her work the moment word came down; no ten or twelve minutes wasted on prep work. \u201cCall the spy in. I\u2019ll see her now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta was an auburn-haired woman with a girl-next-door mix of sweetness and flirty sexiness, undiminished by the 20 or 30 pounds she had picked up since Lacey had last seen her. She had been pleasingly chubby when she had been bounced out of Lacey\u2019s apprentice program to take part in her \u2018Infernal Affairs\u2019 scheme, but now she was quite portly. Moreso than Lacey herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVandergast\u2019s cooking really is that good?\u201d was the first thing the brunette baker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmployees eat free, and she doesn\u2019t pay as well as you do,\u201d Henrietta said, meshing her fingers together and taking them apart repeatedly. Lacey waved off her nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about sparing my feelings. I wouldn\u2019t be targeting the woman if she wasn\u2019t a success, and she wouldn\u2019t be a success if she wasn\u2019t a good cook. I\u2019ve had her food myself. Many of her dishes are sublime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why I sent you to her.\u201d She leaned on her desk, folding her hands together and resting her chin on them. \u201cSo tell me, what have you brought me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly relaxing, Henrietta pulled out a flash drive.</span></div></div>",

She had plugged in the flash drive to review the results of her espionage with Lacey. Seated, Henrietta's portly middle taxed the give of her clothing. She shuffled in her seat trying to get comfortable, still not used to the amount of pudge she had gathered working undercover at Gloria Vandergast's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey regarded her apprentice's trouble with dry amusement. \"That can't be all she's done. I'd hardly think she knows how to make 'fudge' that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing a mild distaste from her employer, Henrietta stopped fidgeting and clicked on the next set of files. \"Err, yeah, well, there's three figures at the city planning offices that have their signatures on these forms, which led me to more digging.\" As an additional nervous reflex, Henrietta had her free hand massage her plump middle. She's was beginning to regret not getting that larger pair of pants before her briefing with Lacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The zoning commissioner and deputy health inspector are in her pocket,\" Henrietta explained over key documents. \"Ms. Vandergast secretly wires the hush money to their private accounts, which coincides with a minor charitable contribution to the parks department from a small holding of hers. Her bribes with the vice president of the local chamber of commerce, however, are not quite monetary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lacey said. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta was about to reply when Alicia, Lacey's test baker, arrived with the requested tray of apple cinnamon muffins. Alicia had her sandy hair tied back in a pintail. Hers was a stocky figure of average height, a little bit of weight visible around her face and upper arms but she was nowhere close to the fluffy fatness sported by Lacey and Henrietta. The kind-hearted spy clammed up, although her nose was instantly drawn to the scent of the freshly baked muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going, don't worry about Alicia,\" Lacey said as she pulled back the wrapper of a muffin, taking a small bite to ensure the flavor was up to par. She motioned for the test baker to take a spare seat. \"She's in the loop for our conspiring against Ms Vandergast. I was just famished after my morning show appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, right,\" Henrietta perked up, also reaching for a fresh muffin. \"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflexes were too slow to avoid Lacey slapping her hand away. \"Get on with the results of your undercover work and maybe I'll consider rewarding you with a treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Ms. Truman.\" Henrietta hurriedly blew on her hand and continued the briefing. \"Margaret Hayward, Chamber of Commerce VP, goes to lunch at one of Gloria's restaurants at least every other day. Ms. Vandergast also has several to-go vittles mailed to her home office. I saw her a few times where I was stationed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome photos Henrietta had taken showed a large, busybody looking woman in a plum suit and floral scarf, typically seated at the best table of a steakhouse to a generously supplied dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut tut,\" Lacey smiled, \"It would appear Gloria not-so-metaphorically has her eating out of her hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Henrietta replied. \"The receipts for her meals would always disappear. Her bribery hides in plain sight, compared to the maneuvering of funds to the others on her take. And then there's the cooking classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooking classes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Vandergast's latest project right before I left,\" Henrietta brought up the relevant file. \"A community enrichment program where Gloria declared she would teach cooking classes, with the efforts to be donated to a local homeless shelter. It would generate a lot of positive spin for the city council and advertise Gloria's other businesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey chewed her muffin thoughtfully, wiping the crumbs from her cheek as she considered this intel. She could tell it was torturing her young spy, who licked her lips as her eyes would dart towards the muffin tray. \"And do you think Gloria is the type to teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really?\" Henrietta shrugged. \"She's kind of bossy and full of herself. I don't think she plans to be teaching for long. Based on the last file I was able to access, it looks like cover for another, sizable charitable contribution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is your way of implying she's buying off a city council member,\" Lacey stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, which I didn't really understand given how well she cooks and how well that worked for Margaret Hayward,\" Henrietta surmised. \"I wan't sure at first Ms. Vandergast would stoop to that level, it almost looked like another of her employees were embezzling her. But I got I lucky break tracking the pie orders to Mrs. Hayward. She bakes pies that are better than yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta didn't notice the wince from Alicia at the implication that any rival of Lacey's could bake better than she could. Being Lacey's test baker, she was used to Lacey's shifting mood and disguised malice as she strove for perfection in her new recipes. The expat British baker showed no outward sign of disdain as she tucked into her second muffin. \"And that's all of the digging up you found on Gloria's naughty bribery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta nodded. \"So, what are we going to do with this info? Expose her, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry your head with the scheming, dearie, I've got a few ideas in store for Ms. Vandergast. Excellent muffins, Alicia,\" Lacey was dividing the remainder on the tray. \"You're dismissed. I'll be seeing you shortly when we do the rounds at the other locations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia nodded politely, glad to be able to step away has she could sense the ice in Lacey's tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you, Henrietta, good to see my faith in your capabilities this last sixth months weren't put to waste,\" Lacey offered her spy a plate with sardonic sweetness. \"You've earned yourself five muffins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Henrietta excitedly bit into her first muffin, practically swooning from the flavor. \"Oh, I've missed your baking Ms. Truman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although you weren't hurting for vittles,\" Lacey poked the auburn haired girl's plump midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta swallowed her mouthful. \"Yeah, it was kind of hard to stop eating what with her employee's eat free policy.\" She didn't feel any less sexy than she did with the extra pounds, current wardrobe issues aside. The weight having come gradually during her undercover employment, she hadn't had clothing issues until recently. Henrietta's vest and undershirt didn't cover the fullness of her belly when she sat down thanks to its size and an extra sup size on her chest. Her pants, a size too small, dug into the lower of part of her stomach with increased tightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about Gloria's pies, how could you walk away from that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I tried most of them. Her blueberry is just divine and she has the best meringue on her lemon--*cough*\" Henrietta almost choked on her muffin when she realized her mistake, catching sight of her employer's face. Lacey's smile was not one of kindness. \"N-N-N-noo, I mean, her pies were bad! As in, worse than yours, definitely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me, Henrietta, you liked her baking more, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lacey! I mean, Ms Truman. Your baking is the best, hands down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Lacey leaned in. \"Because I said your reward was <b>five</b> muffins, and a true fan of my cooking certainly wouldn't let them get cold now would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching wise to what trouble she was in, Henrietta gulped down the rest of her first muffin. She smiled sheepishly, then proceeded to pig out on the next muffin. She soon hit a snag, however, in that while her appetite had grown during her time undercover, resulting in the 30-some pounds on her frame, Henrietta didn't tend to eat this many baked goods in one sitting. And Lacey's recipe for apple cinnamon muffins were rich, spiced calorie bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta really felt pained when she polished off the fourth muffin, the sudden influx of dough in her rapid eating causing her belly to swell slightly, further pinched by her ill-sized pants. She couldn't stomach the idea of eating another muffin yet her boss looked at her expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be topped off on muffins yet, Henrietta,\" Lacey gave her young spy a squeeze, \"there's still room in this muffin top. Keep eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta took a regrettable bite. \"It...hurts...\" she cried with her mouth full. The button of her trousers bit angrily into her engorged belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you stuff it,\" Lacey said, slipping into a hint of her original street louse accent as she jammed the last muffin into Henrietta's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMmmph! Mmmf!\" Forced to eat before she could scream, the last few bites proved to be the breaking point for the stubborn button on her trousers. The button bounced and rolled under Lacey's desk, as the bakery boss eyed her Infernal Affairs apprentice panting heavily now that her belly was unrestrained from the costly effort of gorging on muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Henrietta,\" Lacey said, returned to her usual composure and accent. \"Good to have you back. Just remember where you loyalties lie when it comes to praising the competition. We wouldn't want you losing your figure on your next assignment, would we? Or I'll have you personally dispose of Alicia's failed test batches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta could only nod weakly in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey smiled as she dainty bit into one of her muffins, leaving Henrietta to consider her sins. Now, she had business to take care of and the career of one Gloria Vandergast to destroy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within a week, Lacey Truman had masterminded a scheme to counter Gloria's expanding empire as a restauranteur as a possible rival to her bakery business. Her Infernal Affairs apprentices were dispatched to the Garden Heights Community Center in the City of Trussel the following Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria Vandergast thinks she's going to carve herself out a free reign of real estate with all her fingers in the pies of the city council,\" Lacey had outlined during the pitch meeting. The fluffy British-expat baker delicately took forkfuls of her gooseberry pie going over the con. \"We're going to make anyone whose given her a business license eat their hat. Metaphorically speaking, of course. And sabotaging this cooking class is the way to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey herself was too much of a high profile figure to directly make an appearance at the community center. The calculating mistress of muffins was not against the idea of confronting Gloria directly. No no, there would be time for that later. Even when Lacey would be ready to make a personal attack against Gloria, it would be after this prolonged campaign that left the self-proclaimed #1 Kitchen Boss reeling from watching her own plans crumble beneath her. So Lacey would initially hang back after tasking her apprentices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had plenty to do, of course. She was growing displeased with the manager of her Ridgeway Drive location's perceived lack of motivation, as a backseat baker delegating their duties to all the other workers. The Hangford Lane location needed updated decor. Then there was her second morning show appearance in as many days on a second network. Plus, alongside her new fall frostings, Lacey was experimenting up a full baker's dozen varieties of a new take on scones. Although for Lacey, a \"Baker's Dozen\" tended to add up to 16 rather than 13 in terms of what she would munch on with cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, her crew for this caper brought Alicia and Henrietta to the site of the impending first of Gloria Vabdergast's community driven, homeless shelter supporting cooking class. At least, that's how it all appeared on paper. Classes were still $50 bucks per individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look horrible,\" Henrietta moaned, crouched to peer into the side mirror of a random car in the parking lot. She wasn't used to the glasses, nor the change of makeup or the long black hair of her wig. The tackiness of her outfit was continued payment for Lacey's displeasure during the spy briefing. Grinding her teeth, the mirror reflected the false braces she was forced to wear. She ran her tongue over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep prodding them they're going to fall off,\" Alicia warned, threading her blonde ponytail through the back of a pink baseball cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you get to dress so comfy?\" Henrietta whined. \"You look like a mom of two toddlers. Or a tee-ball coach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" Alicia replied snidely. Lacey's top test baker wasn't as keen on an undercover assignment, if only for the untold possibility of risk. Still, her persona was much better than what Henrietta had been landed. Alicia had the pink ball cap, grey unzipped pullover, purple shirt, jeaggings and track sneakers that gave her a pre-millenium, family oriented female like a young mother or cool aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had a goth phase!\" Henrietta exclaimed, standing to her full height. Being the girl-next-door type, Henrietta didn't give the best new impression in this new guise. It was like your ugly stepsister, that really weird kid everybody would make fun of at the lunchroom at school, decided the hip new thing to do was \"dress goffic\" and came out the other side as a dropped pilot character for cult TV favorite Ugly Betty. Henrietta was pressed into a corduroy plaid vest, fishnets, a tight belt with chains, long skirt and ripped red nylons. She walked with unsteady gait on her platform boots. Her added poundage kept a large enough roll of (albeit veiled) puppy fat added to Henrietta's new portly frame. As added punishment, Lacey forced her to keep the belt tight to curb wayward snacking. Henrietta wasn't about to make Lacey angry again, as the followup belt had a lock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I the one that has to parade around in this getup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't tell you,\" Alicia said with mocking disdain. \"Maybe because you're the one who spent six months working at Gloria's company? And you wouldn't want her to recognize you. Right, 'Millicent'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Millicent' sighed, as her fellow operative had a point. \"Right, 'Jolene.' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so put up with it and stick to the plan. We still have to rendevouz with Quince.\" Jolene (Alicia for these purposes) checked her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Ello, 'ello.\" Came a catcall greeting a low whistle as the last of the undercover operatives arrived in a pickup truck. \"Look what the cat dragged in. Nice tatts, moon pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up Quince,\" the put upon spy crossed her arms over her belted belly bulge. \"They're sleeved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Peter for you the next five weeks,\" replied Quince. Himself a former Londonite, an Eastender from a family with a milling background, Quince had jumped across the pond to eventually wind up as one of Lacey's delivery drivers at the bakery. Having a thinly shaved head and beard, as in 8 o'clock shadow, he was wearing jeans an a layered band tee. \"Looking pretty cush there, 'Jolene,' you should dress casually mo' often. How about we get cozy during this designated time off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just cut down on the fraternizing while we're in character,\" Alicia said. \"Remember, today is about establishing routine. We're to break Gloria slowly over her teaching efforts, maybe cast suspicion on the other attendees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easily done, luv,\" Quince said with pride. \"Haven't cooked mor' than bangers and mash in me life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Henrietta sighed. Alicia had the top cooking talent of the three, as her primary role was that of test baker. Henrietta had originally gotten her apprenticeship for her doughnuts, plus she had picked up on a few other things during her time undercover at other kitchens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like Lacey said,\" Alicia reminded. \"We've got cooking expertise to enact the subtle complications, and it would be more authentic to have a truly horrendous cook for other issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged!\" Quince said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't force us to need a quick set of wheels on the first day,\" Alicia warned. \"I'm going in first. Give me several minutes before you come inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia, Quince &amp; Henrietta in turn entered the community center as Jolene, Peter, &amp; Millicent, respectively, over the next several minutes. Various people had come out to learn cooking from a certified big name chef. There was Gloria's local fans, retirees, one trendy couple looking only for the prestige, and other types among the attendants. The Infernal Affairs operatives spent time mingling about to establish their disparate identities. Regrettably for Millicent, who was having the hardest time making acquaintances, she was stuck with a work station two over from Peter. As even more of a virtual unknown to their mark than even Alicia, he kept up the same obnoxious personality he usually had, having signed under his middle name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, aspiring cooks!\" Gloria introduced the class to titters of applause from the collected students. \"Aprons on!\" The corpulent chef was decked to the nines today. Even the rich couple and Millicent looked to be underdressed. Impractical garb for the kitchen, but then this was more of a class setting. Given the intelligence of the schemes Gloria had behind her charitable classes, all of this was more for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of you have been to culinary school? Show of hands.\" Gloria noticed a few hands, and a woman in the front row with a pink ball cap looking off to the side. \"I'm sorry for your wasted effort!\" Gloria had a belly laugh at her own joke, launching into a demonstration. \"I learned more from six months of restaurant management then I did two years of culinary school. But I will admit the most important lesson they start you with is how to perfectly crack and egg.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glancing strike on her bowl and the innards dropped in with the eggshells still her hand. \"So we're going to practice in preparation for my signature spinach and bacon omelettes. And perhaps my southwest eggs benedict, if we have the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the first lesson was literally how to crack an egg? Jolene found herself making an effort not to do so as skillfully the first few attempts. There were plenty of clumsy first attempts across the board. Gloria demonstrated how the yolk could be separated from the white with just the shell, as she went from station to station making corrections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, if you're going to use your thumbs you don't want them going into the yolk.\" Gloria paused in front of the chubby goth girl standing bow-legged behind the counter. She seemed oddly familiar. \"Have we met before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mz Gloria. Uh, Vandergast.\" Sweat was trickling down the back of 'Millicent's' neck given the thick wig. The ruse would be blown if Gloria caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh sizzle snapped Gloria's attention down the line. \"No! Don't just drip it on the hot pan, you're scorching it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the class, Peter (aka Quince) was only the second worst chef given the hapless teenager who had nearly ruined the pan with the egg scalding. Altogether, Gloria had looked to have taken a lot onto her plate hosting these classes, even before the operations of the secret saboteurs in the flock continued.</span></div></div>",

this time the foot long meat sub with extra cheese, hand cut fries and a side of onion rings.<br>\r\nIn short order the huge meal was devoured again and once again Abi promised to return, this time at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day really had dragged for Grant and even his staff noticed, although they were far too polite to pick up their gentle boss on it, but eventually the waiting was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:23pm, another meal (this time a sliders combo with a sides platter), another rapidly inhaled binge that had Grant watching in awe still even at the third rendition of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, can u get you anything else Abi?\u201d asked Grant upon returning to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could go for something sweet after all that\u201d purred Abi, cradling her noticeably fuller stomach after three huge binges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let me go get you a menu\u201d offered Grant, beginning to turn before a hand grabbed his shoulder and turned him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite\u201d smirked Abi before pulling Grant down and puckering her lips against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*6 months ago*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh Grant, you are making me fat...\u201d moaned Abi as she rolled stretched sweat pants down, allowing her burgeoning belly to spill out over her thicker thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww I\u2019m sorry sweetheart\u201d teased Grant as he came up behind the blonde woman languished on his couch \u201cyou won\u2019t be wanting your birthday cake then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u201d hissed Abi tilting her head back over the couch, exposing her double chin and giving Grant a view down her deeper cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d relented Grant with a smirk \u201cit\u2019s not even your birthday\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi gave off a wicked smile with fluttering eyelashes.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but you baked me a cake all the same\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, you are a sucker for desserts though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm\u201d cooed Abi, stretching her thicker arms for the chocolate cake Grant was holding \u201cyou still owe me from 6 months ago mister\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done alright out of that dear\u201d smirked Grant, sliding in beside Abi where he could offer up a large slice of cake to her lips whilst also squeezing a thick love handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue but...\u201d the blonde broke her own sentence by taking a large bite of cake \u201cI could be SOOO much bigger by now\u201d<br>\r\nAs she spoke, Abi rolled sideways causing her belly to bulge over Grant\u2019s leg whilst she cosied up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c35lbs in 6 months is pretty impressive\u201d said Grant continuing to fondle Abi\u2019s side and feed cake into her waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do better\u201d declared Abi as she chewed quietly, the occasional crumb escaping her ruby lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*2 months ago*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that is...46lbs in 4 months\u201d declared Abi, beaming between cascading blonde and blue locks and increasingly chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez Abi, you REALLY piled it on lately\u201d whistled Grant as he looked Abi up and down on the scales.<br>\r\n81lbs since the day they had met was a significant gain even by Grant\u2019s people watching observations and he wasn\u2019t one to complain.<br>\r\nNeither was Abi having caught on to Grant\u2019s eye for larger women and his ability in a kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou notice anything...similar about me today?\u201d asked Abi with a playful look over her shoulder, side eyeing herself in the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant had.<br>\r\nShe was wearing the same blue blouse from the day they had met.<br>\r\nWell, wearing was a generous term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great fat roll of cellulite coated belly hanging free of the blouse against her thighs cupped in her hands with large chest bulging out of the top, only three stretched buttons managed to hold together.<br>\r\nHer bottom half was bare bar some frilly knickers as her leather skirt was long discarded, her arse soaking empty calories like a sponge whilst supporting a flabby muffin top above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do it?\u201d asked Grant, still looking over Abi\u2019s ballooning figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d grunted Abi, groping her belly with sultry eyes at her own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGain so much weight so fast\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi paused before stepping off the scale.<br>\r\n\u201cWell there\u2019s been a lot of other restaurants opening up lately so I\u2019ve been trying some out\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s some REALLY good food out there\u201d smiled Abi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Better than mine?\u201d asked Grant, feeling a little standoffish now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, maybe not better but more variety\u201d replied Abi honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have enough variety?\u201d pushed Grant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just nice to try other things and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you loved my food\u201d sighed Grant, feeling dejected now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do, I just wanted something different and besides, look at how big I got out of it\u201d<br>\r\nSensing the tension, Abi tried to defuse the situation with allure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh...I need some air\u201d announced Grant, sliding from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Present Day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly things did not improve between Grant and Abi and after some back and forth the two largely parted ways.<br>\r\nAbi was upset and Grant was numb to the situation but they agreed to be friends.<br>\r\nRarely speaking friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worked for Grant though as it gave him chance to concoct a plan for the changing circumstances.<br>\r\nAbi wasn\u2019t the first to go elsewhere as some of his regulars had also shifted and he needed a new edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspionage was, of course, the answer and maybe Abi could be won back as yet.</span></div></div>",

Grant truly is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Grant is the successful owner of three separate diner locations across the city all of which priding themselves in the home felt mentality of serving good food in a friendly setting.<br>\r\nWith a tried and tested catalogue of food, Grant\u2019s comfort belonged in quality meals that kept people coming back.<br>\r\nOne would be lying if they said Grant hadn\u2019t indulged in his own food just a little over the years too with what could only be quantified as a \u2018dad bod\u2019 showcasing said indulgence but his slightly softer figure built into the aesthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Grant\u2019s friendly attitude was almost at odds with the usual group of vicious business people that occupied the title of \u2018Kitchen Boss\u2019 but the results couldn\u2019t be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had shifted though since Abi and Grant had taken it personally that his variety wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\nIt certainly hadn\u2019t helped when it became apparent that Abi wasn\u2019t the only customer jumping ship for some of the more lavish outlets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s where Rebecca had come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently wiping glasses fresh from the dishwasher, Grant\u2019s mind was elsewhere much like always since he\u2019d set his little scheme in motion.<br>\r\nAt least today was the day things came to head and at least Rebecca would be clear of that vile woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight Gloria Vandergast might not have been the wisest decision to go after, her temper tantrums were legendary throughout the industry but Grant had seen opportunity in the constraint.<br>\r\nWith so many more cutthroat individuals out there, Grant felt confident in that offering a guise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey boss, Becs is here\u201d called a member of Grant\u2019s team, a breeze wafting through the kitchen as the back door was held open to allow Rebecca to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Grant, long time!\u201d called out Rebecca as she strode into the kitchen donning a snug fitted jacket and skirt combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to see you\u201d replied Grant, crossing the kitchen and sweeping Rebecca into a bear hug \u201cglad you made it out of there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Grant\u201d chuckled Rebecca, embracing Grant in return \u201cshe\u2019s got a nasty bark but that\u2019s about it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant allowed himself a relieved chuckle.<br>\r\n\u201cWell true, I still don\u2019t envy you for that length of time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say this but I\u2019ve saved a fortune in food so I kinda have to thank you for that much at least\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was 23 years old and had known Grant since Freshman year as a regular hangover fixer and hang out spot for good food and company alike.<br>\r\nSince graduating though fortune had not smiled on the spunky brunette leaving her frequently between jobs and struggling to make ends meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the interest of clarity, Grant had not asked Rebecca to spy on Gloria, rather she had offered to do it after a night of ramblings and ravings in the diner after closing.<br>\r\nAnd so the deal had been struck with Rebecca entering the lions den with the hopes of securing Grant\u2019s culinary future in the face of ever mounting competition.<br>\r\nBy means of payment, Grant had promised a free tab any time Rebecca ate at the diner which served to also ensure the young woman never had to worry about getting a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, it seemed her time under Vandergast\u2019s employment had been a period of good feeding for the recent graduate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs had been the gateway to her finding Grant\u2019s diner, Rebecca had a vicious appetite and the youthful genes to support a student\u2019s life of grease and booze.<br>\r\nHer tenure in espionage however had been weeks of sitting on her arse whilst consuming lavish pastries and indulgent business meeting meals all footed with Gloria\u2019s extravagant menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such her student figure had fallen by the wayside as a well fed globular pot belly sprouted from her hips, leading her figure in a curvaceous silhouette.<br>\r\nChunky thighs ran out of her tight skirt, a little extra on display where the skirt parted, whilst a modest chest perched atop her rounded belly<br>\r\nAll in all Rebecca had clearly sized up in her time away and was considerably more womanly for the pleasure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you manage to find?\u201d asked Grant almost impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much\u201d cooed Rebecca leaning against a counter \u201cbut I am starving Grant, can I get a burger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so...\u201d began Rebecca between mouthfuls of burger, grease dripping from her lips \u201cGloria has got a huge expansion operation going at the moment, baked goods are really her thing at the moment and where she\u2019s putting all her resources\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d mused Grant, a little surprised and concerned.<br>\r\nBaking was not his forte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, like...mhm, so good...she\u2019s perfected a filled croissant recipe with filling between the layers of pastry which are just divine and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant\u2019s mind wandered at that point, the word \u2018divine\u2019 always reminded him of Abi as foolishly as that may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you in there?\u201d asked Rebecca as she wiped her hands on a napkin in a strange parody of elegant business woman gorging on greasy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Yeah sorry Becs, not been getting much sleep lately\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you need to fix that, gonna need your wits about you if you\u2019re gonna get away with stealing Vandergast\u2019s recipes\u201d smirked Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStealing her...wait, what did you do Becs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know, just copied her ENTIRE recipe collection including a draft copy of her new baking book\u201d declared Rebecca proudly as she lent back in her seat causing her bulbous belly to protrude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d asked Grant rather dumb struck that something like that had been pulled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have my ways but it\u2019s all yours\u201d smiled Rebecca, two pristinely manicured fingers sliding into her cleavage and returning with a discreet thumb drive, sliding it across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy, you know that?\u201d Grant said as he picked up the tiny drive and looked intently at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d purred Rebecca \u201cbesides, you offered me a free ticket so I knew I had to bring the goods\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t let you go hungry regardless\u201d remarked Grant, his customer loyalty kicking in despite the gravity of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you will remember that I\u2019m not going to mooch of you for nothing\u201d replied Rebecca, swiping up her coke glass and gently sipping at the edge of the glass, a red lipstick mark left where lips had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell either way, you know you\u2019re welcome whenever you wish\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shall hold you to that\u201d smirked Rebecca, hand resting gently on her rounded belly \u201cbesides, you\u2019ll need a taste tester if I\u2019m not mistaken\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is true\u201d smiled Grant as he made a movement to step out of the booth \u201cRebecca...thank you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, I\u2019ve actually enjoyed it\u201d replied Rebecca with a pretty smile, green eyes shining as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a shirt wave behind him, Grant made his way back to the kitchen with the thumb drive clutched tightly in his hand as a mix of emotions swirled through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Time to kick start a new era\u2019 thought the chef as he reached for he kitchen door.</span></div></div>",

All of her restaurants were at peak efficiency thanks to hiring the best chefs she could, and as such nobody needed her to help in the kitchen. There was one major problem with this though, in that the kitchen boss did not like being being idle at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out her cell phone and a couple of numbers, she would call some of her close friends, namely her favorite co-chef Nicole as well as her own sister, Estelle, over to come and hang out. As soon as she finished talking on her phone, she would quickly set up the kitchen, and wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock* *knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gloria, I'm here! Let me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly heading to the door, Gloria would open it to see Nicole, having arrived in first. Helping her fellow chef squeeze her meaty thighs and fatty hips through the door frame, the boss would hug her as she looked back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's great that your here first, Nicole. You want to help me in cooking up for this hangout? I'll give you standard work pay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, keep it for now, not like I'm working! I'll help cook for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, glad that your still as good of a friend as after...\" Walking up to the kitchen, Gloria would pull out a cookbook from a counter, before flipping through a bunch of pages, looking for a good meal to eat. After a minute of searching, she would pull out a few dollars from her pocket, to use as a makeshift bookmark as she would prepare to get ingredients for various meals to try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nicole...\" As Gloria would say this, she would pull out a footstool to reach up to the top of the huge industrial fridge she had, so she could grab some eggs. \"How do you feel about the 'Henhouse Kitchen's Eggperor Challenge for Five'? I think it was three stacks of 5 pieces of french toast, five stacks of 8 pancakes, ten fried eggs, 30 strips of bacon, a gallon of orange juice, and a whole sausage and cheese skillet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that sounds so amazing, my mouth's already watering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure us two and your sister will be able to finish it all though? I mean, your sister doesn't exactly have the same appetite as us after all...\" Nicole would help pull some sausages from the bottom of the fridge as Gloria would continue pulling ingredients out from the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that... I'll save the remainder as leftovers and then us two can finish it tomorrow morning before we go out for work. Best way to save ingredients after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two would finish to get ingredients, both Gloria and Nicole would start to cook the Eggperor Challenge for their meal. Due to the Henhouse Kitchen being one of the kitchen chains being owned by Gloria, she was quite talented in making the breakfast meals, but Nicole did manage to have a bit of trouble when it came to cooking eggs. Thankfully, since they were working together, Gloria was able to help with her partner's weaknesses, allowing the pair to do well as they continued to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing the very last of the challenge though, they would hear another knock on the door, and as the two would approach the door and open it, they would be rather surprised at what they would see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... why does your sister live so high in this fancy hotel... and why did the elevators have to be closed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please shut up...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before setting down to eat, the Vandergast sisters shared a brief hug. Although Estelle was the older sister and both had similar hair and skin, it was very hard to tell given their disparate weights. Estelle was quite thin, as Nicole had commented about to Gloria about how her appetite did't match that of the fat chefs. In contrast, Gloria was quite doughy, her profile almost hiding her sister's frame from view if it wasn't for Estelle being that much taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the web business going?\" Gloria asked. Estelle had a small but successful web design studio, which Gloria had taken advantage of when setting up the internet sites for her initial restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really great. I just landed a big commission from a yoga school. They've offered me a significant membership discount on classes, I could get you signed up, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard pass,\" Gloria said. \"Keep talking, I was keeping the main course warm in the oven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle sighed deeply. \"Yeah, of course.\" Watching her corpulent sister bend over the oven of her penthouse suite, she couldn't help but think about how Gloria seemed to be getting bigger as her sights were on achieving more acclaimed culinary accolades. Growing up together, her little sister had never been 'little' since they were kids. Gloria had been a butterball of puppy fat that continued into her overweight teenage years and her current burgeoning obesity on the sister's respective roads to business success. Having gotten a feel and eyeball for how plump Gloria was getting, Estelle expected it wouldn't be long before her sister would tip the scales a solid one hundred pounds heavier than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, sis!\" Estelle noticed the quality of food Gloria brought to her dining table. \"When you invited me to come over for breakfast, I didn't think you were whipping up a break-<i><b>feast</b></i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhmph!\" Gloria snorted. \"This was mainly for Nicole and myself before you brought along your own guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, that was more last minute,\" Estelle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks so good!\" said Ophelia, the stranger, who already found herself a seat at the decked out dining table as Nicole Harker put on the finishing touches of plating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad we've got somebody with a hearty appetite,\" she chuckled, before pulling herself two chairs. While Gloria fancied chic, oversized modern furnishings to meet the needs of her large lifestyle, Nicole's enormous hips required extra support. Oddly it looked like Ophelia, who was perhaps as large with her weight mainly focused on her stomach, had managed to just fit herself on one dinning room chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Estelle recognized the counts of eggs next to the french toast and pancakes artfully covered with powdered sugar and fruit chutney. \"This is that 'Eggperors Challenge' thing of yours at the Henhouse, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you expect any less of a breakfast from me?\" Gloria replied. It could be said that the Henhouse, an all-day breakfast diner, had been her first successful chain of restaurants going on three locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it'd be a casual breakfast with my sister,\" Estelle said, being drowned out by the opposing bulks of Nicole and Ophelia tucking into their plates, unable to suppress their appetites any longer. \"Without her latest co-conspirator,\" she added under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch,\" Gloria took her silverware to her bacon and eggs. \"This meal feeds five, sis, if you'd recall. Seeing as we have three of us who can appreciate a good meal, I think we'll easily round up to completing the meal after we consider your portion.\" She took larges bits of her rich eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Gloria loved her sister, although over the past few years she'd been a thorn in her side about her weight ever since Estelle had gone on a health kick. Her 'big' sister kept the skinny genes in the family, a renaissance woman with an analytical mind suited to her web programming, matched with an artistic eye and sporty interests. Each of the Vandergast girls were very creative in different mediums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Gloria wanted was to give her sister the best tasting food whenever she played hostess. Estelle could do with putting some meat on her bones anyways, being too skinny in Gloria's opinion. She didn't expect her to go whole hog about it but Gloria wasn't going to sacrifice flavor what with Estelle considered healthy, cluttering her inbox with emails totting the benefits of egg whites and kale smoothies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her friend...Ophelia was a surprise addition, although the type of gal who enjoyed her food as she dug into her five stack of pancakes and several sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it you do, exactly, Ophelia?\" Gloria asked, looking for a different topic of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia exhaled like a horse, finding room to breathe around the amount of food in her mouth. \"Well, I'm in the programming scene myself. Kind of. More of a blogger really. I'd like to be a food blogger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl!\" Nicole chimed in herself, after swallowing some fried egg. \"We could always use more PR at the Henhouse Kitchen. And there's the big property Gloria's looking to open next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have many followers?\" Gloria asked between chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia took a bite from an outstretched fork. \"*munch* Well, uh, only 50 or so I guess. But I love your food! I've got some of your cookbooks too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big fan, then, although Gloria was looking for more of a 'big name' fan to bring extra acclaim to her restaurants. Conversation subsided a bit as the table continued eating. As expected, the two portly chefs and the mammoth Ophelia were putting away most of the food. Gloria brought up vacation plans she had with Estelle, as the two sisters had been on a cruise last year for the dual celebrations of Estelle landing a big client and the anniversary of Gloria hitting it big in the culinary world. This year's vacation plans were split between a tropical or alpine destination. Critiquing the cruise's food caused Gloria and Nicole to talk shop for a bit, discussing business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia, of course, continued to enjoy the food. Although looking to be a big eater, Gloria noticed she was ruddy faced with beads of sweat forming on her brow. And then the boss of the kitchen noticed something she had missed during the previous conversation over breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle had her fork directed towards Ophelia, with the obese woman taking bites of the offered sausage. The patterned continued with Estelle's last piece of french toast. There was only half a pancake on her sister's plate, making Gloria realize she had been feeding her food to this 'friend' of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives, sis!\" Gloria was aghast. Generous wasn't a quality attributed to Gloria so she wasn't about to charge Estelle for a casual meal with family and friends. But it was an insult to her pride and sensibilities to have her own flesh and blood not eat her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle, suddenly embarrassed at being caught feeding Ophelia, tried to play it off. \"What? You made way too much anyways. You said the three of you would be able to round up to the 'feeds five' amount no matter what I ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still expect you to eat!\" Gloria exclaimed. \"You come to my apartment and don't eat what I offer you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, sis, cool down,\" Estelle said, backpedalling. \"I had one piece of bacon and a pancake, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're aren't experiencing the full breadth of the meal!\" Gloria roared. \"It's called the Eggperor's Challenge for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo,\" Nicole let out a low whistle, eying Ophelia to see if she shared her sentiment. \"Awk-ward, huh?\" The oversized 'plus one' looked confused and unsure of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh sis, why do you always pull this crap?\" Estelle retorted. \"I didn't say your food was bad, just that you make too much of it! You don't have to go overboard on breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been making cracks about my weight since my choice of swimsuit on that cruise!\" Gloria fired back. \"Yeah I'm fat, I noticed, I just wanted to treat my sister on our day off! No matter what I cook it's the same old story just because you can't appreciate it. And who's this strange woman you invited along anyways, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on Ophelia, who tried to shrink into her bulk under the scrutiny. She looked to Estelle, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense meant,\" Gloria said, although her tone was sour as locked eyes with her sister. \"Seriously, who is she to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long, pregnant pause before Estelle spoke.</span></div></div>",

A self proclaimed Kitchen Boss, she aims to create a vast franchise of restaurants, resorts and other facilities that caters to the fat lifestyle. Fat people make the best customers at her eateries and she\u2019ll do anything to keep them loyal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Gloria establish the business enterprise of her dreams? Or will everything go to pot as her franchise crumbles beneath her? Contend with a peculiar customer base, manage eccentric employees, pounce on the latest the business market has to offer. And above all else, outperform Gloria\u2019s rival Kitchen Bosses who want to sink their teeth into her business.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike my other weight gain interactives, Kitchen Boss is less about a prefabricated story or lofty settings. The readers decide what happens next as Gloria becomes the biggest name in the food industry (however metaphorical, literal or ironically). With the starting concept we'll discover together just where the story goes in Kitchen Boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that a few minor guidelines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Feminine weight gain is the primary focus of this piece, although male gain is not forbidden.<br>\r\n- This story starts 'realistically' but more fantastic elements can be added at later chapters.<br>\r\n- Write your best, creativity is encouraged. Bring up new characters, venues and backstory.<br>\r\n- I only edit for grammar and chapter options, although keep the overall 13+ rating in mind as you craft your addition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cast and setting notes can be found here: \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2230985-Kitchen-Boss-Recipe-Book\" title=\"Story notes for Kitchen Boss\" target=\"_top\">Kitchen Boss Recipe Book</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Story notes for Kitchen Boss\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2230985-Kitchen-Boss-Recipe-Book\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>Landmark Author Hall of Fame</b></u><br>\r\nKitchen Boss sat dormant in my portfolio for a few years as I wanted to encourage the growth of the story by others in the weight gain interactive community, rather than any starting outline I would have envisioned.
