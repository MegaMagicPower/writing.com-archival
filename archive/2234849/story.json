            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zack hated going to class, it was the worst part about going to college. He\u2019d rather be doing literally anything else than sitting in a classroom for hours on end. And if going to class wasn\u2019t enough, it had to be this dumb liberal arts prerequisite, \u201cExperiential Humanities\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting through boring lectures was already mind-numbing, but having to listen to some loser SJWs talk about their feelings was even worse. Every class was a different speaker, each talking about their life experiences and the need for understanding and empathy and some other bullshit and the only thing Zack could think about was how much he wanted to get to his dorm room and turn on his Playstation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack was a gamer and he said it with pride; He was sick and tired of the way people, mainly ugly dumb feminists, were trying to ruin his hobby. These days you couldn't to any game websites without some \"woke\" idiot complaining about games for being sexist or racist. It was so stupid. Of course, whenever he brought it up to anyone at this dumb school they rolled their eyes at him or shook their heads. They acted like HE was the bad guy. As if he wasn't the one surrounded by sheep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here he was, stuck in class, again, listening to some fat bitch drone on and on about body positivity or some shit. As if a body like hers was anything to feel positive about. He snickered to himself as he imagined manning the harpoons and taking down this land whale.  He openly sneered as he took her in. She had to weigh at least 300 pounds, most of it blubber, quivering as she talked. Her fat arms were somehow bigger than her fat head. He would have told her to put some sleeves on, but he doubted there were any big enough to cover her. God she was annoying; Didn\u2019t she know how gross and disgusting she was? Zack hated her from the moment she entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid fat bitch</i>. The way she talked like she was special. She wasn't special! It was too much for Zack to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lose weight?\u201d, said Zack, interrupting the speaker in the middle of her talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a few muted gasps and someone from behind him hissed, \u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d, said Kelly Mina, the guest speaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, if being fat is so hard and everything, why don\u2019t you just lose weight?\u201d Zack chided, with a tone that suggested this was the most obvious solution in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s that simple?\u201d, countered Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, if you don\u2019t like something, then fix it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m trying to do that? I don\u2019t like the way society treats fat people, particularly fat woman, and I\u2019m trying to open people\u2019s minds to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell wouldn\u2019t it be easier to just change yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think losing weight is that easy or that we should all just change ourselves to make other people more comfortable? For me personally, losing weight is difficult. If it was as easy as you\u2019re suggesting, I would have done it when I was insecure. But once I learned to love myself, I realized that I didn\u2019t need other people to validate my physical appearance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone was calm, even and measured. It infuriated Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow hard is it to just eat less and exercise? Huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat edge was creeping into his tone, the edge that made people not want to talk to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed lightly. \u201cOK, I think we\u2019re done here. Thanks for the questions though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther people joined in on the laughter. Zack could feel the heat rising in his face. He hated being talked down to and he hated it even more when it was a woman. And when it was a fat woman, it was practically the worst thing he could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, OK, well have fun dying when you\u2019re 30\", he shot back, any attempt at not getting mad completely out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and you\u2019re the model of good health?\u201d She looked him up and down, smirking. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you took a shower? Or were you up all night 'gaming\u2019?\u201d She said it with such a tone of withering mockery that Zack lost what little self control he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed again. Zack felt his face go red, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFat bitch!\u201d, she screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone continued laughing, laughing at him. Kelly smiled, though her eyes looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me Zack, do you hate me because I\u2019m a woman or because I\u2019m fat, or is it both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d he screamed, grabbing his bag and making his way to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be careful about how you treat people Zack, you\u2019d hate for it to come back on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack slammed the door and hurried back to his dorm. He was so angry he didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. It was of course, all her fault. That uppity fat bitch had made fun of him in front of everyone. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
