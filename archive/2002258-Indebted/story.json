Not a drinker, the night at the pub was a bore. Your colleagues thought they were doing you a favour, but it was really an excuse for them to get drunk. You slipped away without anyone noticing and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through thoughts in your mind, you arrive at your home. Your headlights sweep across the garage door. Something doesn't seem right. Not unfamiliar with burglaries, you become alert. You get out of the car and walk around your house, examining the fences and doors. Your hands are in your pockets -- one hand is clasped over your phone, the other around your keys, in case you need an emergency weapon. You can't quite pick out why you're feeling apprehensive. The doors are locked and the lights are on. What's wrong with this picture?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, why are the lights on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should've been the giveaway. No one was home, so the lights should be off. Someone was inside. You plan your approach carefully, unafraid to deal with the intruder. You quietly unlock the front door and gently push it open. The living room light is on. There is no reaction. You step inside, treading carefully over the floorboards. The kitchen light is on. You move through it. You hear a noise. The bathroom. The shower. You slip into the darkened hallway and duck into the unlit bedroom. The shower stops. You can hear someone getting out of the shower. Normally, this wouldn't be cause for concern, but you live alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door opens. A young woman walks out. It takes you a moment to recognise her: Amy. She holds the distinction of being your ex-fiance's younger sister. Though you and Amy were not on bad terms, you hadn't seen or spoken to each other since her sister, Lisa, walked out on your before the wedding. The sight of Amy brings back the bad thoughts. You feel yourself slipping into a quiet rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Amy steps out of the bathroom, you make your move. Within the blink of an eye, you have Amy in a stranglehold. Your left arm is locked around her throat and your right arm is wrapped around her torso, clenching her breast while pinning her arm. You throw your weight to the side and bump against the wall. Amy is taken completely by surprise. Her towel drops, leaving her wet, naked body in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! It's me!\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loosen your hold enough for her to talk. \"How did you get in?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I climbed over the back fence and used the spare key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. The key you hid under the flower pot. Only you, Lisa and Amy knew where it was. Come to think of it, you probably should choose a different hiding spot. Who knows what Lisa would do -- or Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran away from home,\" she replies. \"I...I was going to enroll in a course, and needed money to pay the fee. I borrowed money from Lisa and my parents. But when I went to pay, the money wasn't in my bag. I put it into an envelope,but it was gone. My family thinks I've stolen it. I didn't. They would've killed me. That's why I ran away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the best place to be,\" you mutter. \"How much money did you lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two thousand dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus. That's a lot of money. You wouldn't even think about carrying that much in cash. But, Amy's family was conservative and old-fashioned, and Amy wasn't on best terms with them. You knew that from your time with Lisa. If anything, Amy was the more mature one out of the two sisters. She trusts you, even after the incident with her sister. Still, she is Lisa's sister. It's been three years and you don't know what has changed. Amy is a bit shaken from your aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go of her. She is relieved, but she realises that she has nothing to bargain with. She needs your help. How will you approach the problem?</span></div></div>",

Amy is the spitting image of her sister, and that alone is enough to make your blood boil. Amy stands helplessly in front of you, awkwardly covering her nakedness. You show no remorse over exposing her. Your voice carries a tone of authority and vindication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand straight,\" you order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hesitates,but the weight of your voice causes her to comply. She uncover herself and stands with her arms by her side. You spend a moment to examine her. Unlike her sister, Amy has more going for her in her physical appearance. She is taller, fitter and D-cup breasts were the envy of her sister. Now they could be yours. You begin to formulate your plan for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me be clear,\" you say firmly. \"You've broken into my house. I can call your family right now and they will deal with you. Understand?\" She nods nervously. \"But, I can be a reasonable person. I can help you out of this situation, but I won't do it for free. Firstly, you can stay here for the week, but...\" you pause. \"My house, my rules. No negotiating. You owe me that much. If you don't like it, you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal: you are my servant for a week. I will require you to do work around the house. This will pay off some of your debt. But, if you want to earn more money, you will have to perform favours. I won't force you and you can say no. But, I will only make the offer once. The more I ask of you, the more credit you will earn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nods in agreement. She isn't keen, but she doesn't have much choice. This is your chance to exact some righteous vengeance. There's plenty of work to do over the next few days and there is ample opportunity to be creative, maybe even benefit from her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will be your first offer?</span></div></div>",

You had been with Lisa for five years, meeting her at college and enjoying a happy, intimate relationship. However, a month before the wedding, Lisa suddenly walked out. During the next few weeks, you tried to repair the relationship, but you soon realise that someone else was involved. Though Lisa said he had nothing to do with it, it was clear that she had rebounded with one of her friends. That path was now closed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next few years going through a cycle of remorse, regret and repression. After three years, you've mostly recovered from the trauma and are ready to move on -- to new opportunities, and to new people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the past has a habit of coming back. At first you think it was bad taste for your colleagues to celebrate your three years of liberation. Little did you realise that it was a sign of things to come.</td>",
