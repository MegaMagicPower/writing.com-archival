            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>        It was a warm Tuesday afternoon at Tahoma High School. School was about to end and Jack was looking forward to going and chilling with his buddy Derek down near the river, where it was cooler. Unfortunately, a little while before eighth block ended and the school day was over,  Jack's mom texted him: \"Jack, I'll need you home as early as possible today. We need to get to work on refurbishing the house before your Aunt Clarissa comes to visit here in a couple days. I know you've been wanting to hang out with Derek, but you'll need to reschedule. Maybe head home with Brittany or Bridgette. Love you!\". Jack groaned and nudged Derek who was sitting next to him in class. \"Sorry dude, but today's canceled. My aunt's coming into town and my mom needs me back at the house to clean up for her arrival. Maybe we can chill tomorrow?\". Derek disappointingly nodded. \"Okay, that's fine. I'll let my mom know about the change\". After that, Jack texted Bridgette, asking to walk home with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mind if I walk home with you today? My mom ruined my plans and wants me to walk home with somebody just to 'feel safe'\". <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWithin a minute, Bridgette replied with: \"Sorry Jack, but I have soccer practice and have to report to the field immediately after school\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack groaned again. Without Bridgette as a reliable option, this meant he had to ask Brittany to walk home with him. Not that he didn't like her, she was a very cool person, but if he walked home with her, he had to walk home with her exchange partner, Eiko, as well. Again, it's not like he totally disliked her, but Eiko was especially fond of Jack and constantly stuck with him whenever she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he texted Brittany, Jack thought of someone else who might be able to get him home. Emi, Rachel's sister. Although in college, Emi stuck around Jack's neighborhood hanging out with some of her friends, most of which were still seniors in high school. Emi was also very fond of Jack, but he was unaware of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing only sixteen, though, Jack was indecisive on whether to bother the older girl or not. Does he decide to contact Emi or Brittany? Or does he come up with another option?</span></div></div>",

Would you mind if I tagged along with you and Eiko?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's fine. Meet us out by the sign and we'll go from there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jack resumed class and awaited for the bell to ring to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bell did ring, he headed out to the designated spot and waited for Eiko and Brittany to arrive. A couple minutes later, they did, with Eiko completely lit up with excitement. She giggled, \"Hi Jack, how you be?\". Jack forced a smile on his face and replied: \"I'm doing well, thanks Eiko. How are you doing?\".  Still ecstatic, she replied: \"I good, thanks Jack\" and proceeded to get close enough to Jack to touch arms with him. Brittany broke in. \"Eiko, calm down and get away from him, you're making him uncomfortable\". Following Brittany's order, Eiko stepped away from Jack, although not by much. Jack gave a look to Brittany that muttered \"Thanks\". From there, Brittany and Jack made idle conversation on the way home before Eiko spotted something on the sidewalk ahead of them. \"What that?\" she asked. None of the three knew exactly what it was, Jack picked it up to get a closer inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't the foggiest idea what this is? I'll take it home and do some research\". Even though whatever this was was unfamiliar to Jack, he was interested in learning what it's purpose was. \"I don't know, Jack, we should probably leave it be, it could be pretty dangerous\" Brittany warned. But Eiko was just as interested as Jack and insisted on him learning what it was and getting back to her about it. She thought that this could be a break into getting closer to Jack. \"I'm sure it will be fine, Brittany. I'll have my mom take a look at it in case she might know what it is\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, the three get close to their block and are parting ways when Eiko embraces Jack with a tight hug, forcing his face into the cavern that was her cleavage. \"Bye bye, I see you later\" she giggled. Once she let go, Jack took a huge breath. Brittany laughed and apologized, then they went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he entered his house, Jack looked back to the device he picked up. \"Should I test this thing out to see if it works, or should I just look it up?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich does he choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       Not trusting it's nature, Jack decides that he should look it up before possibly maiming himself. Before he gets to his mom and helps her, Jack heads up to his room to store his new possession. Once he finds a spot for it, Jack takes a look for any possible branding or tagline of some sort which he could take a quick search. He found the brand SRco., and quickly searched it up on his computer. What he found astonished him. SRco. was a company which claimed to produce functional shrink rays for \"professional and recreational use\". Before Jack could learn more, however, his mom entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're finally home! Wonderful! Let's get to work\". Jack rolled his eyes and reluctantly obliged. The two of them began in the living room and slowly but surely made their way around the entire house, making sure to be especially diligent in cleaning the kitchen and bedrooms. Each and every time Jack complained about how unnecessarily long it was taking to clean, his mom replied: \"Oh don't be such a lemon. Clear house, clear thoughts\". \"Clear thoughts?\" he thought. \"What the hell is this woman thinking?\". The longer the two worked, the more and more antsy Jack got. Not necessarily because of the cleaning, but rather the waiting on learning more about the so-called \"shrink ray\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Jack and his mom finally finished cleaning, to Jack's joy. \"Okay, great, I'm glad we're done. I'm going to go rest until dinner's ready, let me know when,\" Jack quickly output, then rushed up to his room. His mom chuckled, then went to the kitchen to prep for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his room, Jack began more research on the shrink ray. Apparently, the company had multiple verification from large retail industries, confirming its legitimacy and piquing Jack's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack next thought about what he was to do to try the ray out. Should he test it out right here, right now in his room? Should he take it to school the next morning and try it out there? Or does someone interrupt before Jack has the time to make a decision?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Bah,\" Jack thought, \"it could have so much more versatility at school\". With that in mind, he put the ray under his bed to make sure no one found it lying around and got any ideas. Soon after, Jack's mom called the kids for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a rather uninteresting dinner, Jack returned to his room and kept researching the shrink ray and SRco. He learned that there were a variety of settings, depending on what the user was interested in. The maximum height it was capable of was one foot and the shortest was one inch. On the website, the company claimed that it was still working on a shorter shrinking capacity, but in the mean time, that was what it could do. The more he read off of the website, the more excited Jack became. Although, this created another dilemma. What was he going to do once the school day had arrived?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night went by quick and Jack was already off to school, the shrink ray in his backpack. To make sure he kept the shrink ray safe and himself comfortable, Jack took an alternate route to school, alone. He managed to make it all the way to the school without any interaction with Eiko, which relieved him. Not long after he arrived, however, Jack was hugged tightly and a pair of hands covered his eyes, which was accompanied by giggling. He sighed, \"Eiko? Is that you?\". With her ever-present giggle, Eiko admitted her guilt. \"Know what is today, Jack?\". Jack sighed oncemore. \"Yes, Eiko, today's a B day. We have classes together\". Eiko squealed. \"Right! I hardly wait for class with you, Jack!\". With that last little optimistic burst, Eiko let go of Jack and went to her first period. Fortunately for Jack, she wasn't in his first period. Unfortunately for Jack, she was in his third and fourth periods. Once she let go, he went back to venturing to his first class of the day, Geometry. Nothing much happened in Geometry other than the occasional quiz or test, but today was different. Jack had the shrink ray with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after the bell rang for first period to begin, Jack got to work on the entry assignment. He was a whiz in math, though, so he quickly finished and turned his attention to the shrink ray. The class was aligned in single file rows, but the seats were spaced out quite well, with much room to spare between seats, which meant that it wasn't as likely for Jack to get caught with the shrink ray out. Just to make sure no one would be too suspicious of his behavior, Jack dropped his pencil near his bag and brought out the shrink ray as he raised back up to his desk. Jack set the setting to 3 inches and just as the teacher began to get up from her chair to collect the sheets, switched the device on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the machine made very little noise and emitted very little light, attracting no attention. Also fortunate for Jack, the teacher got distracted by a struggling student, and ignored collecting the entry assignments. This meant he had more time to explore the classroom at his new, miniature stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he go venturing?</span></div></div>",

He sent her a text, wondering if she was available to give him a ride, then waited for a response. Up until nearing the final bell, Emi hadn't given him a response and Jack was starting to sigh, thinking it would probably be best just to contact Brittany. Just then, Emi got back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure dude, I'll be there in a couple minutes. Meet me out front by the sign\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack breathed a sigh of relief. He managed to avoid the clingy Eiko. The bell finally rang, and Jack made it out to the front sign of the school, to find a rather upbeat Emi waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro, what's up?\" she happily asked. \"Not much, class was a bit of a drag, but I managed to get through it\" Jack replied with a dry chuckle. Emi responded with a laugh, then they took off to Jack's house. Emi took a glance at Jack, then asked \"You doing okay? School take everything out of you today?\". Jack sighed, then answered \"I mean, yeah, but I was supposed to go and chill with Derek and my mom decided today would be a good day to clean up for my Aunt's stay at our house this weekend\". \"Oh, I see\", Emi said despondently. 'Well, maybe this would cheer you up a bit!\" she exclaimed as she handed Jack a drink. \"I'm not really thirsty, but thanks. What is it?\" Jack questioned. \"Don't worry about it,\" Emi winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspicious of what it might be, Jack is hesitant to take a drink. Does he go for it or does he keep it for later?</span></div></div>",

Also, no scat, gore (at least not too graphic), or anything ridiculously violent. Man on man is fine, but please restrain from anything flamboyantly gay. Other than that, go for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack (main character): 16 years old, Jack is beginning his Junior year at Tahoma High School. He has an athletic build with dark brown hair and heterochromatic eyes (brown/blue combination). Given his condition, he\u2019s plenty popular with the girls, yet he doesn\u2019t have the ability to go for the girl he himself likes, Rachel. Jack\u2019s father is deployed in the military, so he doesn\u2019t see him much, but he has a caring mother in Carey, with two sisters, Isabella, who goes by Izzy, and Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarey: 44 years old, Carey has maintained a very fit and curvaceous body. Despite her age, she still gets the occasional gawk by a male passerby with her curly brown hair and soft, brown eyes, accompanying her body well. She\u2019s loyal to Jack\u2019s father, despite him not being around very much, and is very caring towards her three children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella (Izzy): 14 years old, her body has already matured very well and attracts boys from a variety of grades. Her long, flowing brown hair and blue eyes make an equally impressing match in comparison to her body, wooing many who get to know her even superficially. A bubbly personality, Izzy likes to tease her brother quite a bit, but nonetheless cares for him deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: 12 years old, her body has not yet developed like her sister, but her looks are possibly even more impressive than her siblings\u2019. With long black hair and deep brown eyes, her looks accompany her mischievous personality very well. Similar to her sister, Lucy likes to have her fun with Jack, but also like Izzy, has a deep compassion and admiration for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel (Jack\u2019s crush): 16 years old, Rachel is also beginning her Junior year at THS, like Jack. Her hourglass shape makes many boys in and out of her grade go crazy, but she has her sights set on Jack. Rachel considers him a really close friend, but is keeping her true feelings for him secret. If he was in any trouble, Rachel would be the first to answer the call of duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi: 19 years old, Emi is Rachel\u2019s older sister. Even with her very curvaceous body, Emi doesn\u2019t seem to attract the right crowd for her liking. Although in college, she has seemed to take a liking to Jack, unbeknownst to him. Emi is a very opportune girl and would take advantage of any situation in her favor, especially if it involved Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSide Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette: 17 years old, she is a year ahead of Jack in school and his neighbor. She\u2019s been around Jack a few times, but seems to be indifferent about his presence. Whether or not she would intentionally get involved in any predicament involving Jack is unlikely, but she may have to if it coincidentally pops up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek: 16 years old, Derek is Jack\u2019s closest friend, aside from Rachel. They have been friends ever since elementary school and have enjoyed hanging out a few weekends at a time for years. Derek has dirty blonde hair and likewise with Jack, an athletic build. He always comes to the aid of Jack whenever necessary and Jack does the same whenever Derek is in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko: 14 years old, Eiko is an exchange student from Japan, speaking fluent but broken English. Her exchange family lives across the street from Jack, allowing them to interact most days before, during and after school. She has relatively short black hair, dark brown eyes, and paleish skin. Despite her age, she has an extremely matured body, with DD cups and a butt to match. Ever since she arrived at Tahoma, Eiko has grown extremely attached to Jack and wants to be around him whenever possible, sometimes too much for Jack\u2019s liking. If a situation ever arose where Jack would be put in a position of inferiority, Eiko would immediately take advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: 15 years old, Brittany is Eiko\u2019s exchange host. Her petite figure doesn\u2019t bring the attention of many, but she doesn\u2019t mind much. She is of Asian descent, with longish black hair, tanned skin, and dark brown eyes. Her happy-go-lucky attitude attracts her many friends, and that\u2019s enough for her. In terms of her relations with Jack, she\u2019s fond of him, especially since they often walk to school or ride the bus together since they live in such close proximity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia: 18 years old, Mia has finished growing into her body, and her latina background certainly does her many favors. Even though she\u2019s a grade ahead of Jack, she shares many of the same elective classes as him, and as such, has gotten to know him pretty well. A very playful spirit, Mia always likes to tease Jack, especially with her body.<br>\r\n</td>",
