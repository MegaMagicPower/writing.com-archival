None of your friends are coming over and there's nothing good on TV.  You're bored to death.  Suddenly, an idea comes to your head.  Why don't you explore the basement.  You haven't been down there in years and it would put a little adventure in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you make your way down the creaky, old steps.  After observing the room you're in something catches your eye.  A futuristic machine sits at the corner of the room.  Not knowing what to expect, you flip the switch on.  The machine whirs to life and a strange light engulfs you.  After 30 seconds, the light fades.  Nothings happened as far as you can see.  You're still the same...</span></div></div>",

LOOKED LIKE SHE LEFT SOME TIME LAST NIGHT,\" notes your brother in that deep voice that shakes you to your core. For a moment you debate letting go and covering your ears if anyone else says anything, but luckily everyone is silent as he walks into the kitchen beyond the dining room, where your father is working on the electric grill at something you can't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe get's a look at whatever it is, and the growl of his belly above you tells you he's hungry as he suddenly turns away from it, and this causes the cord your gripping to go taunt, his spin fast enough to toss you off of him, hurtling through the air, the floor passing by as you sail right for the table, where a plate of pancakes is already set in the middle.

So it is, that when your father comes in with the last load of pancakes you find yourself unable to do more than cry out and raise your arms as he covers you with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld down by the light, yet firm weight of the pancakes you can't do much for the moment, and so decide to just wait it out, and try to ignore the sounds around you as utensils and hens scrap against plates, and chewing permeates the air. The swallowing is the worst though, that final, condemning sound, which may well be the last one you hear.

Of course, there won't be much left to check, but you get the drift.\" He laughed again but was cut short by another stomach gurgle. \"That damn sister of yours is going to give me indigestion...\" He rubbed it soothingly but it only got worse. \"Shit...\" Ryan suddenly dubbed over and began to expel vomit all over the kitchen floor. It was a continuous stream of mostly digested food, until something caused his neck to bulge out. The bulge went in reverse of what it should, towards his mouth. He spat out a large chunk of food that seemed humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna!\" Casey shouted in excited disbelief. Half crazily, he rolled his sandwich bun several times towards the edge of the counter. He dropped off, the bun breaking his fall to the floor. He ran over to you, who was currently covered in vomit and mucus. \"Are you alright sis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, nothing years of therapy won't fix...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey laughed, \"well come on, let's get out of here before he recovers and chews us both to bits.\" You both begin to run towards an opening in some floor trimming when you suddenly stopped and looked at the passed out body of Ethan. \"Come on there's nothing we can do for him right now, we've got to go!\" The two of you keep running as you occasionally look back, hoping that Ryan will be alright.</span></div></div>",

You can't chew either.\"  He shows Chris a small tweeting bird in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please.  That's easy.\"  Chris takes the bird.  He cups the bird in his left hand and lowers it to his shirtless stomach.  The bird tries to flap its wings uneasily, but Chris holds them tight, petting them gently.  \"Get used to your new home little guy,\" Chris says as he rubs his well-toned stomach.

Chris gulps twice and you can see the shape of the bird as it's pushed down his throat.  Chris traces his finger along his bare chest and then pats his belly, apparently implying where the bird is.

You knew Chris was always the Joker of the gang and he was never afraid of playing a prank on someone. He also loved to stand in the middle and he always needs to gain the most attention from everybody. One day at school there was a beetle flown on my friend's desk. Judie really is afraid of any kind of insects and the moment she saw the little one, she hysterically began to scream. Chris who watched the whole situation with a smile walked right ahead to her desk and dashed his bubble butt directly over Judie's desk and onto of the little insect. \"What's the matter, Girls?\", he ingenuous asked. But of course he had that chuckling smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have your last burger? I'm sure you're full now after your little chicken diet.\", James pointed at the burger, Chris just had splashed the ketchup on. He wanted to take it, as in the same moment Chris took it away from the tablet. \"Not so fast. You can hear that?\", Chris gave his blank oiled belly a slap and it began to growl once more. \"You see? I'm a growing boy, and my tummy is saying I need my proteins.\" Chris smiled and took the upper bread, he took of the burger, to place the ketchup onto it, from the table. He just wanted to put it on it's former place, as he saw a little moving speck in the ketchup. Chris screw up his eyes to get a sharper look at the little grain and then he began to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Brianna's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna was still captured in this giant sea of red ketchup. Her head and arms were free but she barely could move in the slick liquid. She just had freed her face from the salty mass some moments ago, and she still could feel a deep disgust in her guts about that baby bird Chris had swallowed. \"Poor little thing, that was not fair at all.\", she thought, as he just heard James begin to speak. His deep booming voice was not clearly listenable for tiny Brianna. But as she saw him reach for the burger, she was embedded onto, hope came up, that she maybe was spotted. \"Yes it's me! Help! I'm down here!\", Brianna shouted as loud as she could. Something was wrong but. Not as intended she just saw Chris slapping his bare flat stomach. A deep loud growl boomed over Brianna. It was a very oppressive noise and the poor little girl just tried to understand what the heck was going on up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was fast motion as Brianna saw the whole surface around her to lift up and a few seconds later the giant face of her friend Chris came into a better view. As she looked up directly into Chris' face his eyes suddenly began to lock up onto her. A moment later he moved his face a little bit closer and began to squeeze his eyes to get a sharper look. \"Yes, it's me, Brianna!\", the girl started to shout again. Full of hope, she doubtless was spotted. \"Thanks God, Chris, I just thought you would...\", the girl was interrupted as the deep, now ear-shattering, voice of Chris washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- The boys' POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smile was getting stronger, as he saw the little speck to struggle while his scanning look stayed on top it. \"Hi there.\", Chris began to speak in a friendly calm way to his discovery. The same time he poked with a finger into the ketchup just an inch away of the little speck. \"Why are you talking to your burger, you're OK Chris?\", James asked his friend with a doubtful look on his face. \"Oh, I'm just fine. But you should thank me not giving you my last burger. See? You could had swallowed our little friend here.\", Chris answered and then he took his finger back out of the ketchup and put it right into his mouth, licking it clean. James leaned forward to get a better look on to the burger. \"So you now have bugs for friends, huh?\", James said as he identified the little speck. \"Yeah, but more than an ant I guess.\", Chris said. \"You're trashing the burger now or what?\", James asked. \"You're crazy? And what did my stomach tell you about it needs? Anyway, I have to put that poor little thing out of it's misery.\", Chris snickered as he clapped the bread on top of the burger, he held in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Chris moved the burger to his opened gasping mouth. As he did, his oiled six pack tummy let out a loud gurgling sound. James looked at his friend with a little disgust on his face. \"Your crazy, you know?\", he said to his friend, who did not respond. A brief moment James could see into his friends' opened mouth. A mass of saliva spits was forming and flowing in there. \"Damn, he really is still hungry.\", James thought.</span></div></div>",

Gazing up, you scream and jump, waving your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" CODY! LOOK DOWN!! I'M RIGHT HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use, but you know you have to gain his attention somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" IF ONLY I CAN GET TO HIS EAR SOMEHOW, I KNOW HE'D HAVE TO HEAR ME THEN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the wall of fabric covering his crotch right in front of you. Walking up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO CLIMB.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the fabric and begin your climb up. As you make it up to his zipper, your world shifts as Cody moves slightly. You hold on tightly to the loop of the zipper.</span></div></div>",

He knocked on the door, and waited a few seconds.  She realized that getting his attention may be her only hope.</span></div></div>",

He stopped to light a cigarette, and she realized now was her chance, maybe the man could help her.  She started jumping an screaming as loud as she could, and he looked down at her.  He kneeled down and reached his giant hand to grab her.  She realized maybe this wasn't the best of ideas and turned to run, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank reached down and wrapped his hand around the tiny girl.  His fist completely enclosed her.  He could feel her moving and chuckled to himself.  He'd have to get the shrink ray another day, but for now, he had something just as valuable.</span></div></div>",

She now stood face to face with the giant man, his giant eyes examining her, his lit cigarette lazily dangling from his lips.  She guessed she was only two inches tall, and the man, assuming he was six feet tall, would be like a giant over 200 ft tall.  She watched as the cigarette rose up as his lips closed around it.  His cheeks hollowed and the cherry glowed.  His off hand removed it from his mouth as he inhaled the smoke.  He smiled, pursed his lips, and then, before she knew it, a torrent of smoke rushed out of his lips and onto her tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank opened his hand and looked at the tiny girl.  She didn't move.  He took a drag off of his Marlboro and blew the smoke on her to see if he could get a reaction.  The tiny girl started coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to be sure you were alive, tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Mister, just call my mom and she'll -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't very well do that little one.  Then she'll know about the shrink ray.  Well, and then I'd have to shrink her too.  Now you wouldn't want that would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira listened to Hank's words.  She definitely didn't want anyone else to have to be this tiny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what're you gonna do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anything I feel I reckon.  You're not quite in the position to argue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank looked as the helpless little girl shuddered at the ultimatum.  He laughed a little, and then took another drag on his Marlboro, blowing more smoke on her tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it, honey.  I like smoking.\"</span></div></div>",
