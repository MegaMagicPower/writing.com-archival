In short notice the many students began packing their things and bid a warm farewell to their teachers, merrily moving along as they passed through the illustrious gates of the institution. On their way out many of them passed by you\u2014an average run-of-the-mill janitor\u2014smiling wide with goodbyes and farewells as you did the same. They were the pride and joy of St. Adelaide's K-12 Academy\u2014all of them bright students with bright futures ahead of them, and you couldn't be more proud of them as were all the staff members. Speaking of which, one of the security guards came up to you, having just gotten back from her break.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heya,\" she greeted you, mouth stuffed with powdered, jelly-filled doughnut. \"Keepin' an eye on our girls eh?\" You nodded, just making sure that the girls made it across the street safely and met up with their friends and parents on their way home. \"Still can't believe the year's just barely started, but hey, that just means we all got a year full of good times ahead of us to look forward to.\" True that, and with all the wonderful students you had the chance of getting to know, you knew it was going to be a year to remember. \"Anyways, I came here to grab you for a bit. The principle's got somethin'\u2026heavy she's gotta tell ya'. She wants you to meet her and the others in the teacher's lounge.\" Confused, you asked her what she meant by that. \"Well, it's pretty serious, involves you, and needs to be discussed like right away. Don't worry about the girls, I'll keep my eyes out for 'em.\" Thanking her for the message and for keeping lookout, you squeezed through some of the students coming out of the gates and made your way to the principle's office, exchanging kind words and smiles all the way there. Eventually, you came upon the teacher's lounge and found all of the other staff members inside having patiently waited for your arrival.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, there you are,\" the principle greeted you. \"Please, take a seat.\" While everyone greeted you as well and there was no hint of malice or scorn, something about the atmosphere felt incredibly tense. Once you were seated, the principle cleared her throat out and began to speak. \"Now, I'm just going to get this out of the way right now; you are being accused of stalking our students and harboring lecherous intentions towards them.\" This shocked you; after the orientation you went through someone was going around accusing you of perving on the girls! Remaining quiet and not wanting to make yourself look bad, you urged the principle to go on. \"Eyewitnesses are claiming that a suspicious hooded figure had been seen loitering near the girls' restrooms during recess periods in an apparent attempt to eavesdrop and spy on the girls and women who went in and out of these restrooms.\" You knew right off the bat that that wasn't true; you had actually never set foot near the restrooms while school was in session, and you wondered who could be coming up with such slander. \"We have asked the eyewitnesses to come forward to meet you in person to verify this, yet they have declined. I have spoken with the police with the matter and found that the eyewitnesses had provided them video footage. I had to fight with them long and hard to get a copy of it because they claimed that 'it would endanger the eyewitnesses' or some such rubbish and they would not give me their names, so here we are. I had to have you here so you could see it for yourself.\" The principle pulled her phone out and pulled up the video evidence of you suspiciously hanging around the bathroom, except it clearly wasn't you hanging around the restroom. In fact, the restrooms didn't even look like the same ones in the school at all, and upon close inspection you could see a little boy or two passing by the area. Immediately you knew something fishy was up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My thoughts exactly. This footage clearly could not have come from our school because we have no other male members here but you, student or otherwise. The issue, of course, is that with information like this spreading quite quickly many people are assuming the worst already. Worry not, we have our own footage to prove this forgery wrong, though given the general community's stance on you I doubt that hard unaltered evidence will get them to change tunes overnight, and I suspect that the local police is on this conspiracy as well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Those police officers never do shit for this school anyways,\" the P.E. teacher remarked. \"They're always either stirring shit up about this stupid witchcraft mess or whatever they can come up with these days, and now that we finally have a good man in our school for the first time instead of those asshats they wanna jump on this case like a fatass on cake.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just can't understand why they won't just leave us all alone\u2026\" The music teacher said. \"What have we ever really done to them?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This school has been an all-girls school for centuries since its founding to give the poor girls in the area a chance to learn and grow, and it wasn't an easy fight with all of them being accused of being witches,\" the principle said. \"Most of the men in this area cannot seem to accept a woman growing beyond being a stay-at-home babymaker who fetches them whatever food they desire and sleeps with them whenever they wish.\" You recall the principle mentioning that during your orientation, and looking back on it you were very lucky to even get the job considering how unlikely everyone thought that you would get it. You proved them wrong of course and earned their grateful respect. \"Since girls can learn to be whatever they wish at this school beyond that, quite the number of men have been opposed to this institution and the mostly male-dominated police force are among them. Still, we'll just have to fight this case and hope that we can pull this off. That is all I wanted to discuss with you, so you are free for the rest of the day. Get safe home and have a good rest of the evening.\" You gave the principle and the other teachers inside a respectful nod and left them in the teacher's lounge. Things were not looking too good for you given that the police seemed to already have their handcuffs waiting for you by the sound of it, and with how the other men disliked you it was obvious that some other man had tried to set you up. Why that was you didn't know, but you weren't about to let them ruin your life like this. Before you could leave through the gates, one of the other security guards came up to you in a hurry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me, wait up a moment!\" She stopped before you all in a huff. \"Sorry for bothering you, but I need you to get to one of the restrooms near the back of the school really quick. My stomach had been killing me all day and the girls were all using the restrooms up in the front so I, well, I might have left a bit of a mess here and there\u2026\" You gave the woman a roll of the eyes though with a chuckle and smirk, remembering how you warned her about the spicy foods she was gorging herself on. \"Hey those were damn good buffalo wings I'll have you know\u2014totally worth the near diarrhea accident. But anyways, I'm sorry about the mess and I promise that I won't be so careless next time. Can you do me this solid before the principle tans my hide for this?\" Laughing, you told her that you had it under control and that you'd find something to tell the principle if she ever caught wind of it. \"Oh, thanks man, I owe you one. Anyways, I better hurry on home; my husband gets a bit\u2026finicky when I'm not there before he gets back. See ya!\" You waved the security guard goodbye and made your way towards the back of the school to find this restroom the woman sullied. You stopped by your office on the way there to get whatever tools you might needed; you never knew how much of a mess could have been left behind. With everything you needed, you resumed your trip to the restrooms and got there in no time at all; while the institution was a large, university-like place you knew your way around it like the back of your hand. Eventually you made it to your destination and found the restrooms in the back; they were never used according to the other staff, at least until today, and they certainly looked abandoned like they were haunted. In any case, you opened the restroom door and expected to see a puddle of shit all over the floor, but you instead found the last thing you would have expected: someone was still in the restroom\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmmph\u2026!\" Standing\u2014or rather squatting before you was a small girl who looked to be no older than 10, and her back was turned to you while her backside was exposed to the air. Evidently she was having trouble pushing out the turd hanging out from her tailpipe and was so engrossed in this that she didn't notice you come in, at least not at first. Surprised from the sight, you made no sound, not even as the girl suddenly stopped straining and looked up to turn her head toward you. Shining eyes full of innocent intrigue and with nary a hint of embarrassment or shame met yours, and soon a wide smile graced her lips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, hello there mister! What's your name?\" You knew right then and there that meeting this strange girl was going to change your life forever\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

If this were a dream it was certainly the most surreal, and yet here she stood before you, and cold reality came upon you once again as you struggled to get out words to say to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heehee, you're silly mister!\" she laughed. \"Won't you tell me your name? Pretty please?\" Reason finally returning to you, you awkwardly asked the young girl what she was still doing in the restroom while averting your eyes from her form. \"You're so funny, I asked you first~!\" How the child could remain so optimistic for her age was beyond you, but it was clear that you were getting nowhere asking your questions without having answered hers. You started off with your name and told her what it was you were doing at the moment, and again she laughed that childish melody. \"Aw, you're in the wrong potty mister! The stinky potty is right over there.\" She pointed past you to the door on the other side of the restroom you were in. All flush-faced with embarrassment now, you thanked the young girl and was about to beat a hasty retreat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, you're leaving?\" the girl said with sadness. \"But I haven't finished pooping yet. Won't you stay with me so I can finish?\" You stopped dead in your tracks upon hearing that, and wondered why such a young girl would ask something like that. Surely she knew of how much trouble you would get if you were seen with her like this. You tried explaining this to her and that you had another job to do, and again she simply laughed at your apparent ignorance. That lady who had to poop real bad left it dirty but it's all clean, so you can stay with me now!\" This was complete nonsense the girl was saying, and while trying to be as nice as possible you bid the girl a short farewell to clean the other restroom. Ignoring her whining, you quietly closed the door and made your way to the other bathroom. With your cleaning tools you were set to work, but once you entered the restroom you found it to be completely spick-and-span; not a trace of grime or dirt or pollutants to be found anywhere, and inside you found a note from the security guard from earlier, apologizing for leaving the now nonexistent mess behind. How she had paper to write with considering her situation was beyond you, and even more was that the bathroom was completely clean like the little girl had said. Perhaps someone had come by before you did and cleaned it for you? In any scenario, it was clean and there was no more reason for you to linger. Leaving somewhat disappointed at the lack of work, you left the restroom behind and considered heading home, but then you'd be leaving the girl in the bathroom behind, and that was irresponsible no matter how you looked at it. Reluctantly, you knocked on the door, calling out for the girl to see if she was almost finished. There was no sound on the other side, and you thought that maybe the girl had already left; given how talkative she was when you were there she would have responded by now. Seized by some unknown temptation, you opened the door and chanced one last look, and for the second time that day you were left in shock.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The girl from before had not left; in fact she seemed to still be struggling with her turd from earlier before it finally broke free from her behind into the toilet below with a ripe fart. You could only stare aghast as she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All done!\" she cheered to no one perhaps. Slowly she stood while pointing her somehow spotless behind to you, dragging her bloomers up to her hips and letting her dress fall down to her ankles. When she turned around she laid eyes upon you once more and broke into a bright smile. \"Yay, you came back mister!\" Something was clearly not right with this child and you wondered how she happened upon the school, but you put that thought to the back of your mind and asked the child who she was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am Princess Aim\u00e9e Ros\u00e9 Europa! Isn't my name pretty mister?\" It was certainly a pretty name but that wasn't really what you were after. You asked after the child's parents and how worried sick they must be about her, and in an instant the girl's smile fell, replaced with a sullen frown. \"My mommy's gone to\u2026sleep with the flowers, and my daddy doesn't like me\u2026 I don't want to go home\u2026\" That alone was disturbing for a child to know acutely of the death of one's own parent, and her household already wasn't shaping up to be a happy one from what you heard. Still, you had a moral obligation to return the girl to her surviving parent for her own good, at least for the time being. \"Ooh, I know! You can be my new daddy!\" That certainly threw you for a loop; the girl had already bore no shame relieving herself before you, and now she was asking you to be her new father? Assuming that her real father wouldn't try to kill you, how were you to suddenly explain your new \"daughter\" to everyone? Besides being a bachelor you were also a virgin so virtually no one would believe that she was your daughter anyhow. You did your best to dissuade her and tell her she needed to go back to her actual father, and that if something happened to her that you'd call the authorities right away (before realizing that they'd likely do jack shit about it). Maybe one of the staff members could take her in, but the girl then decided to pout over the matter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, no! That won't do! You MUST be my new daddy!\" Her stubbornness was expected though you were going to put your foot down until the girl tried pulling off the persuasion card.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you promise to be my new daddy then I'll go to school and be a good little angel! I'll get good grades and make my new daddy proud, then when I get bigger I'll be super rich so I can take care of my new daddy!\" It was true that you didn't have much in the way of finances but you weren't about to use this girl for that, but before you could refuse her with finality she had one last trick up her sleeves\u2014or rather her dress.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My daddy would let his dirty friends come over and try to tickle me in weird places until I peed myself!\" Aim\u00e9e said this as she lifted her dress up, not enough to show off too much of her braless bust but more than enough for her bloomers to be on full display, not to mention bruises and a welt or two here and there. \"Daddy and his mean friends drank stinky juice and spilled it all over my pretty dress, and their breaths smelled like car poot, and he wants me to be his perfect princess when he does mean things to me! He hurt mommy and she went to go sleep with the flowers forever! I hate daddy!!\" Hearing the girl pour all of that out on the verge of a tear-filled tantrum sure made you throw out any sort of reservation you had against her staying with anyone but her father. Feeling terribly sorry for the girl, you knelt down to comfort her saying that she'd never have to go back to that man if you had anything to say about it. Sniffling back tears, Aim\u00e9e asked if you would be her new daddy, and while you resisted the waterworks for a spell the softy in you eventually gave in and said yes; you'd be her new father if it made her happy. Aim\u00e9e looked up at you with surprised eyes and ran to hug you as tightly as she could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ooh, thank you so much new daddy! I promise I'll be a good girl and make you and mommy proud!\" You were glad that the girl was starting to lighten up again though the matter of eventually relocating all of her stuff would be a hassle, especially if the girl's father was the stay-at-home type, but things would get done and soon enough the man himself would be put behind bars once they gathered enough evidence against him. For now, getting her to a safe place away from him was your priority for the time being.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can we go home to our house daddy?\" Aim\u00e9e asked, and while you were on board with her being anywhere not at her old home, you still weren't sure if taking her straight to your house was a good idea, especially amidst the case going against you of being a perving creep. Maybe asking one of your coworkers was a better idea, but Aim\u00e9e seemed to read your mind and refused against it. \"Daddy's not thinking of leaving me in a stranger's house is he? I want to go home with daddy and spend the night with him!\" When she puts on that infectious smile of hers and clings to your arms she makes it hard to really say not, especially since she seemed to trust you a great deal which was honestly flattering. In the end, you decided that you were going to\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

She seems to have been through a lot and you wanted to indulge her, so you agreed to take her to your home.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yay! I'm going to my new home with daddy!\" Aim\u00e9e squealed. Petting her on the head, you took her by her hand and led her out the restroom. By now the sky had darkened with the sun nearly vanished from the horizon, and holding on tight to Aim\u00e9e's hand you made sure she didn't stray far. You hadn't run into any of your coworkers, which you suppose was good for you, but was eerie how no one seemed to be out and about even with how late it was getting. This meant that there would be no one around to disturb you on your way home and that left Aim\u00e9e with plenty of time to ask you question after question. It was typically girly subjects like dolls, dresses, and candies (you discovered that she could be placated easily with candy\u2014hard candies of the fancy kinds in particular\u2014through these talks) before she suddenly swerved into personal topics about you, including poking her nose into your love life (or lack of it thereof) and wondering if you lived with anyone (to which you answered that you were on your own for quite some time).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, you made it to your house, and Aim\u00e9e couldn't be any more excited; you'd never seen anyone so excited to enter your house\u2014not that you had any real visitors in a long time. After stepping foot in your house for the first time since you had left it, you took a small stretch and hung your clothes on a nearby rack. Aim\u00e9e had taken to run around in your house in unadulterated excitement, and you hoped that she didn't break anything while she was staying with you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey daddy, who's this?\" Aim\u00e9e asked you, bringing you a portrait. Looking at it, you knew that it was the picture you had taken back in high school of you and your then-girlfriend. You both looked so happy in the photo, but it was not meant to be and the two of you broke up on bitter terms over trivial things. You were more than okay to get back together with her, but by then she insisted on burning the bridge between you both and you had not seen her or her new boyfriend since. Snapping back to reality, as awkward as it was to explain this all to a child, you went ahead and told her that the lady was your ex-girlfriend. You didn't feel comfortable telling Aim\u00e9e why you had broken up, but you did tell her that the love between you two was gone and she left with another guy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So\u2026you broke up just like mommy and my old man?\" If this child wasn't just the master of raising more questions about her household\u2026but you figured you'd learn more about that later. You told Aim\u00e9e that you had been living on your own since then after your father kicked you out for it. \"Aw, your own daddy kicked you out the house\u2026well don't worry, you have me now; I'll take care of you!\" You questioned how a ten-year-old kid could really \"take care of you\", but you appreciated the sentiment behind it and patted the kid on her head. Just then your stomach growled, reminding you that you hadn't eaten anything since you left the house this morning, and after a bit of teasing from Aim\u00e9e you made for the kitchen to fix you both a small dinner. Mashed potatoes and vegetables weren't really your thing but you couldn't be too picky being a bit light on grocery money, though Aim\u00e9e seemed to really enjoy it despite it being leftovers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yum! I never ate food this tasty!\" And the string of questions you had continued, but it would've been rude to spoil the girl's happy mood and you just smiled at her as you ate your own fill. Eventually you both had finished your plates, with Aim\u00e9e thanking you for the meal; you told her to think nothing of it and went to washing your plates, at least until Aim\u00e9e interrupted you. \"Wait! Lemme help, I can wash dishes super good! Watch!\" Then at a speed you didn't think possible for a little kid, Aim\u00e9e soaped up and scrubbed the dishes for you. Surprised, you could only stare as Aim\u00e9e washed the plates like she was some expert maid before gently setting them out to dry. \"Ta-da, all clean!\" Aim\u00e9e noticed the dumbstuck look you had on your face and giggled. \"My old man used to make me wash dishes all the time, especially with mommy gone\u2026 I hated washing his dirty dishes but whenever you need me to wash dishes I'll get it done super quick!\" At least that was one mystery solved, giving you just a little more insight into Aim\u00e9e's family life. Still, you thanked the girl for a job well done and she smiled wide, happy that she was being complimented.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, do I get a candy for cleaning the dishes? Mommy used to always give me one whenever I did my chores.\" Now that was something you didn't think you could do for her; you had literally no reason to keep candy in your house until Aim\u00e9e had arrived, so it was very awkward for you to tell her that you didn't have any candy in your house. \"Aw\u2026 Oh well, maybe next time?\" She sounded hopeful at that prospect, and while you didn't want to let her down you didn't know if you really had the kind of money to buy the candies that she loved. You just told her that when you had enough money then you'd consider it, and she seemed satisfied enough. Yawning, you were about ready to hit the hay, and then you remembered that there was only one bed (a one person bed at that) in the house. It had been a while since you did the laundry (to get that funny smell out of your sheets), and given what Aim\u00e9e had been through you didn't want her sleeping in such a bed. That left the two of you with only the couch, and it wasn't exactly comfortable.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's wrong daddy? Are you upset?\" Aim\u00e9e asked. You weren't really upset, but you were bothered by how unsuitable your place really was for the girl. Maybe it was better off for her to stay at one of your coworkers', but it was too late for that right now. You told Aim\u00e9e that since the bed was dirty that you two would be sleeping on the couch, and you expected Aim\u00e9e to be disappointed by that; she was, but only a little bit. \"That's okay! Me and mommy slept on the couch sometimes whenever my old man didn't want us sleeping with him; we always heard funny noises like other ladies were sleeping with him so mommy was okay with sleeping on the couch with me.\" Choosing not to be bothered by that admission, instead rather awkward with sharing a sleeping space with a young girl after you already seen her privates, you asked Aim\u00e9e one last time if she was really okay with sleeping on the couch with you. \"Yup! I know my daddy would never hurt me.\" True, though you were somewhat put off by how comfortable she already was with a total stranger. You figured that you'd have to get used to it and gave up fighting it. You told Aim\u00e9e to stay put while you went to go get some cleaner blankets, and with them in tow you carelessly tossed all but your briefs onto the floor before laying on the couch. For the third time that day Aim\u00e9e threw you in for a complete loop by doing the same thing\u2014discarding everything but her bloomers and all but hoping right onto your stomach, knocking the wind out of your sails.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry!\" she apologized. You were quick to forgive her, and doing your best to ignore the almost completely naked girl on your body you pulled the blanket over the two of you and bid the girl goodnight. \"Wait! Aren't you going to give me a goodnight kiss? Mommy would always give me a kiss on my forehead before we went to sleep.\" Resisting the urge to chuckle (which helped stifle the oncoming stiffy), you gave the girl a quick peck on her forehead and then said \"goodnight\" to her while she did the same, snuggling up against you before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After some time when you were sure she was sleep you went over everything that had gone on that day in your head, trying to make some sort of goddamned sense of it all; not even a week had passed since you started your new job at this school and already your life was drastically changing, from the accusations of stalking girls at the school flying left and right, and capped off with Aim\u00e9e suddenly coming into your life insisting that you be her new daddy to get away from her apparent shit heel of a father\u2014and all that besides the fact that you saw her intimates at least thrice that day. This all sounded like it came straight out of some fantasy work, and you weren't sure if you could take much more shocking swerves at this rate. You hoped that things would just calm down and settle into a somewhat normal routine for you and Aim\u00e9e if she was to keep living with you. Still, you suppose that worse things could have happened, and it sounded like Aim\u00e9e really needed a supportive adult figure in her life which you were more than happy to provide for her. It wasn't all that bad, and in a way being needed like this made you feel like you were still worth something. Smiling at that thought, you finally allowed yourself some peace of mind, and before you knew it you too had finally drifted off to sleep, looking forward to the days that would follow\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

In fact, the couch itself was far more comfortable than you last remembered it; maybe it had to do with spending the night with sweet little Aim\u00e9e? Regardless you were waking up to a pleasant morning, and not too soon Aim\u00e9e began stirring as well. When she awoke, the first thing she saw was your smiling face, and in turn she smiled as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'\"Good morning daddy\u2026\" Aim\u00e9e greeted. You greeted her in kind ruffling her curly hair, asking her how she slept. \"I slept like a baby! I had the best dream ever!\" Happy for her and a tad curious, you asked what it was about. \"Me and you and mommy all went to a theme park! It had knights, kings, queens, dragons, everything! We all ate delicious food and got on the rides and\u2014and\u2014\" It was amusing to watch her gush about the theme park and the good times you had with her and her mother, and seeing her so happy you knew that you wanted to see that side of her again in the future. Maybe you <i>could</i> adopt her as your own kid, but then you'd have to go through her father, and God knows you aren't fit enough to get into a fight with anyone. That all would come later though, and right now you wanted to focus on taking care of this girl and doing your job at school. Speaking of which, you wondered just how educated the girl was, and if she wasn't already enrolled you'd have to get her in the system sooner or later. When Aim\u00e9e calmed down enough, you asked her if she ever went to school.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No\u2026\" she said, turning sad. \"Mommy taught me at home, but when she was gone my old man didn't want me studying, saying that a good housewife needed to learn how to care care of grown-ups properly.\" It was as you had expected\u2014a home-schooled child in dire need of further education. Then, however, you questioned how she got into the school without anyone apparently noticing her, and voiced your concerns about this to her. \"Oh, I just walked in and got lost. Also, watching so many other girls was super scary, so I ran to the pottyhouses in the back and stayed there until everyone left!\" Ah, so that explained why you found her in the restrooms yesterday. You had assumed that she was already a student and had folks back home waiting for her, but now you know the truth of it all; you had to take care of her and make sure she got ahead in life since it was clear her father had no interest in that. Smiling, you told Aim\u00e9e that you'd enroll her in school so she could make some friends and learn a lot about the world, though she seemed a little hesitant.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? But, there are so many other girls in the school! What if they don't want to be my friend?\" You patted her on the head and assured her that there would always be one person who would love to be her friend, maybe even her best friend. Hearing that made the girl smile. \"Thanks daddy! I promise to do my best!\" Strange how fatherly you were towards Aim\u00e9e already but you figured it to be natural. Anyways, you were in need of a morning shower and some breakfast, so you had Aim\u00e9e (gently) hop off of you so you could get ready for the day, and again you were met with the sight of her standing in only her bloomers. You quickly averted your gaze from her and asked her to stay put for a few minutes while you took a shower.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once you were in the privacy of your bathroom you chastised yourself for letting your eyes linger on Aim\u00e9e's bare body for so long; you couldn't act that way or have any sort of impure thoughts about her, not after what she had been through. So, you decided that a cold shower for starters would help keep that side of you down. After disrobing yourself you turned the shower head on and stepped in, surprised to find the water at a perfectly warm temperature, despite the hot water being out for the bath yesterday (which was why you skipped a bath last night). Oh well, you thought; the water was perfect and any thoughts about having a cold shower were gone by then. It only lasted for so long until you heard your toilet flush and your warm shower water turned to ice in an instant. Yelping, you knew who the culprit was and was about ready to chew the prankster out. Peeking your head out from behind the shower curtains, you saw Aim\u00e9e completely dressed, save for the bloomers now at her ankles, as she sat on the toilet staring at you in surprise.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's wrong daddy? Are you okay?\" For a moment you were silenced by the sight of the girl on the toilet, but then you remembered having told her to stay in the living room and asked why she was in the bathroom. \"I'm really sorry daddy, but I had to poop super bad!\" You could forgive her for that, and with that you awkwardly went back to your shower. Throughout the whole time you were showering you could hear Aim\u00e9e's grunts and sighs as she vacated herself into the toilet, and you couldn't help thinking back to the first time you caught her with her pants down. Her butthole was completely spotless despite emptying herself into the toilet and\u2014wait a second, she didn't wipe herself after that. She had just pulled her bloomers up and that was that. Was she not taught to wipe herself either? Curious, you had to ask her to make sure she wiped her butt clean before pulling her underwear up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But, my butt's never dirty,\" she replied. Even if that was true, you made sure that she knew to always wipe herself in front of other people\u2014in the girl's bathroom of course. \"Alright daddy.\" Glad that you got through to her on that front you went back to showering before she interrupted you again. \"Daddy, can you help wash me?\" You froze when she asked you that. \"Mommy always used to help wash my back, but my old man never helped me clean myself. He always said I smelled strong like perfume and told me to stop bathing until I smelled really stinky\u2026\" Even after hearing that you weren't sure if it was a good idea to let her into the shower with you lest your erection creep up again, and that would make things even more awkward between you two. Eventually though, you relented and agreed to help her wash her back at least. \"Yay, thank you so much!\" The very instant she was in the shower with you, stripped all the way down, and then she hugged your wet self. She already had one of your clean towels in her hand and went for the soap, lathering her towel before she went to work on herself. Taken aback by this display, you just took your own towel and went to work on her back in silence as she hummed to herself. Doing your best to ignore her butt and the pleased sighing from Aim\u00e9e, you soon took notice of what looked like a pair of wings tattooed to each shoulder plate. Curious (and fearing the worst) you calmly asked Aim\u00e9e why she had a pair of wings tattooed to her back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm? Oh, um, I asked mommy if I could get some pretty wings drawn on my back, and she had one of her friends come over and draw wings on me.\" You asked when she got the tattoo and Aim\u00e9e suddenly seemed even more confused than at first. \"Well\u2026 I think I got them when I was\u2026um\u2026I forgot how old I was when I got them\u2026 But they didn't hurt a bit! Mommy's friend was super skilled and I didn't feel a thing!\" Aim\u00e9e had to have been lying a little bit, at least about the not hurting part. Her skin looked so delicate that it should have been unbearable for her, and given her surprise when you brought the topic up she clearly wasn't expecting you to take notice of them. They <i>were</i> beautifully drawn wings if not incredibly intricately designed, but she seemed uncomfortable talking about the subject so you simply let it be and went back to washing her back. In time you finished her back at the same time she finished everything else.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All done!\" she announced. Thank you so much for helping me daddy!\" She hugged you and you lightly flinched from the contact of her naked body against your own, throwing out a stuttering \"you're welcome\" before she let go of you and left you be to dry herself off. She then shouted that she'll wait at the dinner table for breakfast before finally leaving you alone. What you wouldn't give to know what went on in that child's mind sometimes\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After you handled the rest of your hygienic needs in the bathroom, you went down to make breakfast only to find that Aim\u00e9e had already made you and herself a full plate of pancakes, eggs, bacon, and toast with orange juice. Astonished at how quickly she had made breakfast you asked if she already had some of the food sitting out when you went to the bathroom. She answered yes, saying that her mother had taught her a lot about cooking, and went to wolfing down her food. You likewise ate your food in silence, taking in everything she had told you. After that you had gotten yourself completely dressed and ready for work, taking Aim\u00e9e by her hand and making your way toward the school. Soon you made it through the gates and made your way to the registration office, already preparing yourself for the awkwardness that was going to transpire. Inside, you saw the principal handling her paperwork from behind the registration desk; she looked up from her desk to find you in front of her and she gave a barely noticeable smile.<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" she greeted. \"Is there something you needed to speak to me about?\" Straight to business as always she was; you told her that you wanted to introduce her to someone you wanted to enroll. \"A friend's child perhaps? Very well, where is\u2026she\u2026?\" She took pause when she noticed Aim\u00e9e holding your hand, who gave her what you assumed was a normal smile, though there was a mysterious feel to it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi Miss Principal!\" Aim\u00e9e greeted, though the principal didn't immediately respond.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, er, hello there, little lady. Might I ask, sir, what your relation to this child is\u2026?\"<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

My uncle is now acting like my substitute daddy until my real daddy can make more money and I can go back home with him and mommy!\" You found yourself staring at Aim\u00e9e in shock; she turned out to be a very good liar from what little she just said to the principal, and that made you wonder about what else she was hiding from even you given her reaction to you finding her tattoo. You met the principal's eyes, and she looked between the two of you with a questioning eyebrow. Out of the corner of your eye you thought you caught Aim\u00e9e silently pleading with the principal before she snapped back to normal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, right, of course. You did mention that your brother had a daughter before.\" You said the opposite before today, though you were still grateful that the principal was playing along for whatever reason. \"So, you wish to enroll your darling niece into our school?\" You confirmed that that was the idea. \"Well, classes have already started, but it is still the first week so I am certain that we can find a spot for her. I believe that the teachers will do their best to accommodate our new student here, and in no time she can fit in with the rest of the classes just fine.\" You thanked the principal for her generosity and prepared to sign some documents here and there, and with that Aim\u00e9e was now officially enrolled into St. Adelaide's K-12 Academy. \"There. Now, if you would, I would like to take this time to guide your niece around the school grounds. I doubt that we will have any more last-minute children wishing to join our school. In the meantime, you may get started on your work for today.\" You graciously bowed and bid the principal a well rest of the day as she escorted Aim\u00e9e out of the registration office, and with that you were officially off to do some work.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The day was uneventful for the most part, besides the occasional student greeting you, and there was honestly not much to clean up after considering how most of the girls were neat and tidy. Out of boredom, you grabbed some lunch and opted to visit the students during recess, mostly wanting to spend a smidge of time with your Aim\u00e9e. Out in the playgrounds for the K-8th graders, you could find the girls running around doing just about everything from messing around with makeup to making sandcastles and even football (gridiron football it was called from what you heard), though Aim\u00e9e was just about nowhere in sight. After some time of scanning after her, you instead found a young girl sitting at a table all by herself despite all the commotion going on around her. She looked to be the same age as Aim\u00e9e but with jet black hair in a bun toward the back, and her features were softer but with deceptively sharper looking brown eyes. She also dressed in what you knew was formal Eastern Asian attire (you didn't know if it was Chinese, Japanese, or what), but what caught your attention most was that she looked sad\u2014lonely even. Curious as to why she was sitting all by herself, you made your way past the various other students and called out to her. Surprised, she looked up at you not knowing what to say, but you simply smiled and took a seat next to her, asking if she wanted to eat lunch with you. Much like you assumed she would, she looked away all flushed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"U-Um, I-I guess I can eat lunch with you\u2026\" You thanked the girl before opening up your lunchcase, showing her some of the things you grabbed from the cafeteria. Not wanting to go too far with her you mostly ate in silence, making a remark or two about how good the food was every once in a while to yourself. You were about to eat the last chicken strip before the girl began speaking up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, s-sir?\" You gave her your attention, putting your food down. \"M-Maybe it's best if you\u2026sit with the other girls\u2026\" Having fully expected that perhaps you would end up bothering the girl, you apologized for troubling her and made your way off the table to find another sitting spot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, n-no, you're not bothering me. It's just\u2026I-I don't think I'm good at making friends. Some of the other girls tease me for looking like a funny-looking princess, and other girls usually just avoid me\u2026 I don't want them to start making fun of you for sitting with me\u2026\" That was ridiculous, you thought, and whether or not some other students would make fun of you it didn't matter. You told the girl that you didn't care who said what and that you sat wherever you wanted. If no one wanted to be this girl's friend then maybe you could be her friend.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"R-Really?\" the girl asked, shocked that someone was asking if they could be friends with her. \"B-But, you're a grown-up, and my mother doesn't like it if I talk to boys\u2026\" You told her that her you were a man, not a boy, and since you worked there you could talk to her whenever she wanted to if she needed anything. \"You mean it?\" You told her absolutely while giving her what was likely the dumbest and goofiest grin you could manage. The girl only stared at you for a moment, but then she started holding back laughter. Looked like your little plan worked after all.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are so silly mister,\" the girl said, trying to cover her giggles. \"Okay then, you can be my new friend.\" She gave you a polite bow and you gave one in kind before asking her what her name was. \"Oh, well, my name is Li Yang. My mother says it means 'Beautiful Willow'. What is your name mister?\" You were about to tell her that until the two of you were interrupted by Aim\u00e9e's sudden presence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi daddy\u2014I mean, \"Uncle\"! What are you doing?\" You told her that you were making friends with one of the other students here, about to introduce Li to her until you noticed her shrinking away. Aim\u00e9e took notice of her and her eyes lit up like brilliant gemstones. \"Oh wow, you are so pretty! What's your name?\" This only made Li retreat further and you lightly reprimanded Aim\u00e9e for startling the shy girl. Aim\u00e9e quickly apologized before taking a seat on the girl's other side. \"Sorry for scaring you.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, no, it's not problem, really.\" You introduced Li to Aim\u00e9e and told her that she didn't have any other friends besides yourself, trying to get Aim\u00e9e into the swing of befriending the other girl.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'd love to be your friend! You can be my friend too!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup! We can be best friends!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, wow, best friends\u2026\" Li looked off to the side blushing furiously as if that was too much for her, though her mouth tugging upwards from behind her hands proved otherwise. She turned to face Aim\u00e9e with the warmest smile and gently took the other girl's hands into her own. \"Y-Yes\u2026! I would love to be friends with you!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yay! We gonna be besties forever, I just know it!\" The two girls giggled among themselves and you felt proud of yourself for taking the time out to help a young girl make friends. Just as you were about to slip away you eyed a group of girls making their way over to you three, all of them dressed in dark colors, and the looks on their faces indicated that this was not a friendly meeting.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look girls, the fairy girl actually made a friend! Isn't that just cute?\" the lead girl said while the other five or so snickered to themselves.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"U-Um, h-hello\u2026\" Li replied, making no effort to look away\u2014out of fear, you thought, of angering the other girls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, look, she even brought some of her lunch to share with us. Don't mind if we do.\" Just as the lead girl was about to grab some of Li's lunch, Aim\u00e9e stood up and blocked her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, she didn't say you could have some!\" Aim\u00e9e said, causing the other girls to grimace at her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, butt out of this princess. I didn't hear her say 'no' did I?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's note nice to take some else's food without asking permission!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, what? I have to ask for YOUR permission like it's YOUR food. Puh-lease, now outta the way pinky.\" The lead girl just shoved past Aim\u00e9e and flashed a mean grin. \"I'm sorry fairy girl, as I was saying, it is so nice of you to share your lunch with us. You don't mind\u2026do you?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2026well\u2026\" You could not believe what you were seeing; by now a crowd of other students, young and old alike, had gathered around you all yet no one did anything about it; if one's peers weren't about to take action, then it was time for the adults to step in and put their foot down.<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

My dad's chief of the police force, and my mom's helping pay for this school; if they think I'm being treated bad in any way this whole dump's getting torn down.\" It was bad enough that the police were after you about a case you had nothing to do with, but knowing that this girl's father was the very same man leading the case nearly made you back down from scolding her further; letting her push around the other students was unacceptable, however, and even with the threat of this reaching the chief policeman you continued on telling the girl that she was not getting off scott free for getting physical with your \"niece\".<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, so your her 'uncle' now? Weren't you just her 'daddy' a few seconds ago? All I have to do is tell my daddy that you were looking at me funny and you'd be locked away for life, and then your little girl's gonna have to go back home to her real daddy.\" How the girl somehow knew all about that you didn't know, and quite frankly you didn't care, and you were about to warn her once again until she threw the mother of punches right at your testicles, forcing you on your knees to the ground to a chorus of all the other girls gasping. The punch was no joke; it hurt like a grown man decking you, not a middle -schooler. Right before you could get back up, the girl was already kneeling at your level, moving her head right up to yours.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wouldn't be threatening the young daughter of an accomplished police chief and a lawyer\u2014both of whom are very rich I must add\u2014if I were in your position,\" the girl threatened. You saw the girl pulling out her iPhone and with a few finger flicks here and there showed you something that shook you; there was a recording of you entering the girl's restroom and running into Aim\u00e9e just as she was relieving herself, with you standing there until the girl took notice of you. You recognized this as having happened yesterday when you met Aim\u00e9e, and you wondered how this girl could have gotten that footage of you when you were positive that no one else was around yesterday. \"I'm pretty sure <i>this</i> little clip outta prove that you're a dirty creep perving on little girls in the bathroom\u2026\" You began wondering if this girl was the same person who submitted the fudged footage the principal showed you yesterday, and that might have explained why the police would not hand the footage over or reveal the identity of the witness; if this was some sort of conspiracy that the police chief himself was in on then you wondered how you could fight against the case laid against you. \"Now, if you don't want me turning this video in to my daddy, meet me up in the bathrooms tonight. I want you to do something for m\u2014\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, that's enough mess out of you!\" It was at that moment that the girl found herself snatched away from you<br>\r\nby one of the security guards. \"Assaulting one of our employees here and threatening to have this school shut down! Not happening on my watch!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ack! Let me go you\u2014\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm hauling your sorry butt right to the principal!\" Despite the girl's protests the security guard made no effort to slow down or loosen her grip despite the pickle she'd be getting herself into, though you appreciated that she came to your rescue when she did.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And as for the rest of you troublemakers,\" the second security guard began, \"we're letting you off with a warning this time since you didn't actually do anything, but the next time you stir up trouble you can expect phone calls straight to your parents. Understood?\" The remaining five bullies gave out squeaky \"yes ma'am\" replies before bailing the scene. \"Alright girls, that's enough staring! We've got the situation under control; you can go back to whatever you were doing.\" With that the crowd slowly dispersed as the girls all eventually fell back into their routines for the day. Then the security guard knelt down to you and hoisted you up; she was surprisingly strong for her build and size. \"Hey, you alright? That girl didn't permanently damage anything down there did she?\" You managed to laugh through the pain at the jape and assured her that your testicles were\u2014though sore\u2014still intact.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry about that, those girls are your typical troublemakers. The one that hit you is Angela Viktorov, the spoiled rich brat of the police chief and his lawyer wife who invested into this school. She's been nothing but trouble since day one, her and her friends, but we're treading on thin ice since her mother only invested in this school so long as her daughter attended and her father hates our guts, and we were in a tight spot because of our girls-only tradition. Because they both pamper her like she's queen, if they think anything funny is going on with their daughter, they'll both have us all arrested and have this school closed down permanently.\" So the girl was using her parents' influence to do whatever she wanted with little fear of getting in trouble, but the worst part was with how she now had more leverage against you with the footage she captured of you. Speaking of which, the security guard had knelt down and picked up said iPhone, and you were hoping that she wouldn't turn it on and see the video. \"In any case, the girl's getting her phone confiscated for the time being to teach her a little lesson. I doubt she'll be recording punching grown-ups in their privates for a while. You laughed weakly and nervously; it seemed like the security guard hadn't caught on to what was really going on and that was good for you, though you still shuddered at what the girl said to you before being hauled off. She wanted you to meet her in the bathrooms at night, when the school was closed down? There was definitely something strange about that girl Angela\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyways, good job setting an example for the other girls. Hopefully they'll stand up to bullies more often.\" You smiled at the woman and took the compliment, and with that she left you be with Aim\u00e9e and Li. Speaking of, the two girls spoke up once you were sitting back on the table you were at.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm\u2026I'm so sorry mister\u2026\" Li apologized. \"I was just\u2026scared of what those girls would do to me if I said no, so I usually let them do whatever they wanted. I didn't want you to get hurt being my friend\u2026\" You told Li that it was all fine; friends stood up for each other and had their backs. You'd happily\u2014maybe not that happily\u2014take another punch to the nuts as long as it meant getting the mean girls to leave Li and Aim\u00e9e alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uncle's so brave isn't he?\" Aim\u00e9e said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He really is\u2026\" Eventually recess came to an end, and all the girls went back to class, with Aim\u00e9e and Li bidding you farewell for the day. This left you to your work once more, and when you made it inside the building you were stopped by the principal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello once again,\" she said. \"Returned from your extended break with our students I presume?\" Then you just remembered that you went over your actual break time, apologizing to the woman. \"No need for apologies. By the way, I had just finished speaking with Angela Viktorov and we decided that we are confiscating her iPhone from her for the day as punishment; one of the security guards told me she had planned to record you after assaulting your, erm, testicles, thus the punishment. Her parents have already been notified and they are not well pleased by the punishment as you can expect.\" Of course they wouldn't, but there was little to be done about that for now, especially if you wanted to fight the case leveled against you. \"In any event, Angela has agreed to be on her best behavior from here on out, although she said the very same the last time she was called to my office. One more incident like this and she will be suspended from the school.\" If she was suspended then it was very likely her parents would take drastic measures against the school though, and the principal knew this. \"I pray that it does not come to that but in the end it is what it is. Now then, I do believe I have a job for you later this evening.\" You were listening, wondering what the principal had in mind. \"When all the staff leaves, I will need you to stay behind and tidy up around the school grounds. Nothing too major, just to make sure that everything is neat and tidy for the morning tomorrow. When you are finished, lock the place up; I will give you a spare set of keys since you are a member of our staff and all staff personal are required to have one.\" You accepted the keys from the principal and thanked her. \"You are most welcome. Now, off I go. I have some paperwork to attend to.\" She gave you a bow and left you alone in the hallway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the keys the principal handed you, you would certainly be able to meet up with Angela and see what it was she wanted with you. If you were a no-show you feared that the worst could happen, but maybe she was only trying to bait you into a bad situation for you to use against you and the school. To meet up with Angela Viktorov or not to\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

With that you went about your duties for the day, and you hadn't run into Angela or her friends throughout the rest of the day. Soon enough, the end-of-day bell rang, and that meant all the students were free to go home. As you waited near the gate for all the students to go on home you spotted Angela apparently arguing with her parents. Her father looked especially displeased and shut down the argument they were having, ending with the girl sulking and slowly climbing into her parents' car after they briefly bickered between themselves. Looked to be an unhappy home you thought, though your thoughts on them were interrupted by Aim\u00e9e and her new friend Li running up to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi Uncle!\" Aim\u00e9e greeted. \"Ready to go home?\" You told her that you had some business to attend to, though thankfully you had arranged for one of your coworkers to drive Aim\u00e9e to your house and stay with her until you got back at least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Me and Aim\u00e9e had so much fun today.\" Li said. \"Mother will be so happy to know I have a new friend!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, thanks for being my friend too! Hey, maybe we can have a sleepover party soon! Wouldn't that be loads of fun?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, um, Mother doesn't really like me going over other people's houses or inviting company over\u2026\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww\u2026 Well, maybe we can change her mind soon enough!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I would like that very much.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So this is where you were hiding,\" one of the security guards said. \"Welp, guess it's time to take you two girls home eh?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, um, thank you miss\u2026\" Li said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry about it, I'm just doing my job. I'll go and take Li here home and then I'll be back for you Aim\u00e9e. Think you can wait that long?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can wait,\" Aim\u00e9e said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright then, see you in a little bit.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bye Li!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bye Aim\u00e9e.\" With that the security guard escorted Li to her car and waited until the girl was buckled in properly before driving off the site. Soon the number of students passing through dwindled until it was just you and Aim\u00e9e left at the gate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, Daddy, what did Angela want to meet with you in the restrooms for?\" Aim\u00e9e suddenly asked, her voice taking on an uncharacteristic edge to it. Her serious tone had caught you off guard and you didn't answer her. \"Was it because of the video she had on her phone?\" So Aim\u00e9e had heard Angela whispering to you earlier; the girl was just full of surprises. \"The principal saw the video and tried deleting it, but because Angela had it on some\u2026'online storage' the principal said\u2026she couldn't really get rid of it, so she left it on Angela's phone in case she checked her phone and found it gone. She didn't want to get in trouble for messing with Angela's phone in case Angela's parents got involved.\" The principal having seen the video was the last thing you wanted to hear, but her trying to delete it was what caught your attention, yet despite this she didn't mention a word of it to you\u2014likely to cover up the real reason she took the girl's phone. \"I think you should see what Angela wants; she'll find some way into the school for sure and I don't trust her not to do anything really bad, so I made you something in art class today with Li's help.\" Aim\u00e9e pulled something out from her dress; a little clay angel with a halo and wings on a necklace of beads\u2014perfectly crafted and beautifully colored you noted<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a good luck charm just in case Angela tries to hurt you. Just wear it around your neck like this\u2026\" Aim\u00e9e put the necklace around your neck, \"and voila! It looks really nice on you Daddy!\" You thanked the girl and ruffled her head, earning a fit of giggles from the girl.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, Aim\u00e9e, there you are,\" the principal said coming from the gates. \"I just spoke with Gloria on the phone and apparently she's been caught in a bad bout of traffic. She's not going to make it back in time to get you home by the time it gets dark.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, really? I just hope Li gets home safe.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She will sweetie. In any event, I've elected to take you home myself for her, so she need only take Li home.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? You'd do that?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yay! Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Any time sweetie. Oh, and before I forget, here's your staff badge.\" The principal handed you a badge made in the shape of St. Adelaide's K-12 Academy. In case you hadn't noticed it, all staff members are required to wear it. My apologies for it having slipped my mind yesterday, but after today's incident with Angela I feel you should wear it so students will know by your badge that misconduct towards you will not be tolerated.\" You accepted the badge from the principal and pinned it to your shirt. \"Splendid, now doesn't that look nice on you? By the way, this badge comes with a special button on it; for students who are particularly rowdy, especially between the older ones from ninth through twelfth grade, you just press it and our security will come right along. Don't hesitate to press it whenever\u2014and I do mean whenever you need help dealing with some of our students. We do try to make St Adelaide's a haven for young girls and women to learn, but not all of our students will play nice.\" You thanked the principal for the badge and promised her that you would do your best in maintaining safety in the school. \"You are most welcome. Now, if I may, I must be going to take young Aim\u00e9e home for you. Do try not to stay too long looking after the school alright?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bye Daddy\u2014I mean 'Uncle'!\" Waving goodbye to the principal and Aim\u00e9e, you disappeared behind the gates and locked them from the inside. Despite thinking that it should keep the likes of Angela out of the school, Aim\u00e9e's words from earlier made you wonder just how the girl would get in the school. Getting straight to work, you went around the school grounds mostly looking for any trash that the students or staff members left behind and throwing it away. The school building was far less messy than the playgrounds and sports fields. With how big the school was you knew it would take you until dark if there was anything to thoroughly clean. Saving the restrooms for last, a part of you dreaded somehow finding Angela in one of them (or any student really), so this time you knocked on the door and called out for anyone still inside. Not hearing anyone, you announced that you were coming in to clean the restrooms, and opening the door you found the restrooms to be empty to your fortune. Unfortunately the restrooms were quite messy, leaving you a lot to clean up after.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took some time, but you finally cleared out all the restrooms of any filth left behind in them, and by the time you were completely done with the school nightfall had come. There was no sign of Angela anywhere in the restrooms, so maybe she gave up on that and stayed home. Now you were free to go home back to Aim\u00e9e and enjoy the rest of your evening, so you made your way to the school gates and started unlocking them, at least until you heard someone behind you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Going somewhere, mister janitor\u2026?\" It just wasn't so\u2014you couldn't believe that it was actually happening, but when you turned your head around you were met by the sight of Angela Viktorov, and she wasn't alone either. The same five friends of hers from earlier were with her too, and all of them had mischievous grins plastered on their faces. \"I do remember making it clear where we were going to meet up didn't I?\" How she managed to get into the school grounds was beyond you, and you knew straight away that Angela and her friends were no ordinary middleschoolers. Thinking quick, without turning yourself around just yet you pressed the special button on your badge on the hope that the principal really did mean 'whenever you needed help with the students' and you were relieved that it made no sound or light. Now turning to face the girls, you reluctantly put your keys away and asked Angela what she was after.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You, of course,\" the girl replied. \"I want to talk to you about a few things. Now, if you'll be so kind as to come with us\u2026\" You complied, trailing after the girls as they led you straight back to the restrooms all the way in the back of the school that you had finished cleaning. \"After you,\" Angela said, gesturing you inside the restroom. You went inside, somewhat expecting the girls to trap you inside, but instead they each followed you in, with the last girl locking the door behind her with the lock on the doorknob. You eyed the girls suspiciously, wondering why they all stared at you like a juicy slab of meat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I like you,\" Angela said, sauntering up to you and circling you. \"Not everyone actually stands up to me unless it's the dumb school staff.\" You merely replied that you had to be the grown-up and diffuse the situation. \"Yeah, yeah, I figured that part out already, but I figured that knowing what you had gotten yourself into with\u2014what was her name again\u2026ah, yes, Aim\u00e9e\u2014that you knew better than to get tangled up with a girl like me, yet you kept on at least until I punched you that is.\" She tossed her blonde curls about her, proud of her dirty deed. \"Remember, I still have footage of you creeping on the very girl you took away from her real father, and by now he's likely wondering where she is as we speak, and that's not even getting into the serious charges my father has against you. So, I've got a deal for you\u2026\" Angela snapped her fingers and suddenly you were tackled down by all five of her friends who, despite their size, were actually overpowering you before pinning you hard to the ground as Angela stood over your face. \"You can become my perfect little manslave\u2014or I completely ruin you for the rest of your life. So, what will it be\u2026?\"<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Oh, this is rich! So you'll do anything I say as long as I don't harm her in any way?\" You repeated yourself and made it clear that you would do whatever she said if she did nothing to hurt Aim\u00e9e. \"That's strange; I'm pretty sure the agreement was that you'd do as I say and I simply wouldn't expose you as the pervert you are to the rest of the world. I don't have to listen to anything you have to say, but you disobey me just once and it's over for the both of you, so I guess in a way publicly uploading this video will hurt your precious little Aim\u00e9e.\" You resisted the urge to simply fight the girls off and then the deal was completely off, but if Angela truly did mean to make Aim\u00e9e miserable by having you tossed in prison for life then perhaps it was best for you to simply do as she said. You were mad beyond belief, but right not you had no choice but to comply for your little girl's sake. You told Angela that you would agree to her terms solely based on what was spoken here and that should she break her word then you would call off the agreement then and there, but all she did was laugh at you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really, are you still trying to bargain me like you have any real leverage over me. God, but you are a stubborn one\u2014though I suppose that's what makes you the perfect manslave: it'll be all the more fun to break you\u2026\" Angela started muttering something strange; you couldn't make out any of the words, and soon all the other girls were saying the same thing. Maybe your eyes were playing tricks on you, but you could've sworn that the lights in the restroom were dimming. Then, without warning, they exploded, blinding you in darkness, yet none of the girls seemed bothered by this as they continued their strange speech. Listening to them more closely, it sounded less like they were talking mere gibberish and more like they were\u2026chanting? Were these girls trying to perform some magic chant? Suddenly, the floor beneath you lit up something violet, and that was when you started panicking. Maybe this was all some elaborate prank set up by some of the older girls? When you looked to the girls, they weren't wearing their school uniforms anymore; they were now dressed in\u2026some strange black strips going across their bodies and\u2026bones? Not just bones but black feathers were decorated around their body too, and horns in the twisted shape of halos were coming out of their heads while leathery bat's wings sprouted from their backs? This was the part when you were questioning what in the actual fuck was going on; the girls had changed their clothes completely while keeping you pinned down and sprouted actual fucking horns and wings. Looking up at Angela, her appearance had changed too; much like the other girls she also had wings and horns, but she also had a feathered tail with a barbed stinger at the end, feathers at the back and base of her wings, and four cardinal horns that merely seemed to be holding up a glowing purple halo floating over Angela's head. Angela's clothes had also disappeared, replaced with the same bone and feather decorations the other girls had with the addition of spider lacing, body paint, and the lack of underwear revealing her slick intimates to you, and when she looked down at you she smiled with a mouth baring advanced canines and slitted eyes, all while she continued her chanting. You also found that your own clothes had been completely discarded, laying in a pile over by the door. The girls stopped chanting for a bit, and that's when Angela slipped a hand of her into her vagina, moaning deep, throaty sounds as she drooled her skeet onto your face; to your horror it was burning your skin a bit, but you didn't want to give these girls the pleasure of hearing you cry out in pain so you sucked it in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Angela's hand was completely drenched in her own juices, she resumed her chanting and took her hand to draw some sort of strange symbol on you. Again you felt the intense burning feeling and did your best not to scream out as Angela traced a pattern all over your abdomen. Worse was that she moved on to your asshole, plunging her fingers inside and finally drawing a pained yelp from you, but she ignored you as she kept chanting, drawing her skeet from your asshole up your ballsack. Any further attempt at holding back a scream was thrown right out the window, and she continued tracing a line spiraling up your now erect dick to its tip.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now, the covenant has been forged,\" Angela spoke, taking her fingers from you and digging into her vagina once again. \"Signed in blood, never shall they who sign the pact break their vows, for they who shall defile their pact shall suffer forever in the flames of damnation, denied their absolution of sin from God here unto eternity\u2026\" After masturbating enough, Angela began lowering herself until the tip of your penis met her vagina, and slowly did you slide into her hellish heat. You met some resistance on the way, but even that eventually gave way as Angela impaled herself upon her, relinquishing her virginity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Ahhhh, yesssss~!!</i>\" Angela cried before breaking out into evil cackling. \"From here unto forever shall you be my manslave! And may you suffer every moment of this delightful torment!\" Angela started bouncing up and down on your dick, seemingly intent on milking you dry while the other girls continued their chanting. You just couldn't believe what you had gotten yourself into; going from a lowly janitor at an all-girl's school into some sort of demon's slave for the rest of your life\u2014a part of you was hoping that this was all just a nightmare and that you'd wake up any moment now, but the feeling of Angela's tight vagina raking your penis raw felt too real for it to be a dream. Soon your mind began to slip and your vision was going dark. Was this was death felt like\u2026? You could barely make out the shape of one of the girls straddling you from above, but soon all sensation, all feeling besides the excruciating pain you were in faded away. Your last thoughts were that of pleading to anyone who was out there to save you from this nightmare, before you thought of Aim\u00e9e, sweet little Aim\u00e9e\u2026<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Daddy\u2026? Daddy\u2026Wake up\u2026\" Was that Aim\u00e9e's voice\u2026? It was hard to tell; whatever you did last night left you with a nasty hangover, and you honestly didn't want to get out of your warm bed. \"Daddy, wake up\u2014we're going to be late for school!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Late for school?! You quickly jumped yourself out of bed asking Aim\u00e9e what time it was. \"It's seven fifty three! We're going to be late!\" Despite the horrible grogginess and the feeling of being drained, you hopped yourself out of bed while clumsily throwing on your clothes and bolted straight for the kitchen to grab some breakfast. True to your assumption Aim\u00e9e had made your breakfast and you quickly snatched it off the table. Aim\u00e9e was already at the door and the two of you ran straight to the car. The car got off to some false starts but after a spell it was working like a charm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You finally made it to the school, just a few minutes late, and Aim\u00e9e bid you farewell and went straight to class while you beelined for the principal's office to report for work, nearly running into the lady herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Goodness gracious sir! Calm yourself, you nearly ran me over!\" she chastised. You apologized for your tardiness, claiming that you may had have a bit too much too drink; everything tasted like ass and you just couldn't seem to remember what happened last night after cleaning up behind the school. \"W-Well, don't drink so much the night before work, and good God sir <i>please</i> take a breath mint or two! Your breath literally reeks of sh\u2014I mean, your breath is horrible! And look at you\u2014hardly presentable! I had a feeling you may show up to work like this, so I provided some items to help freshen up, now go tidy yourself up at once!\" You bowed and ran right past the principal to the nearest faculty restroom, zooming by your bewildered coworkers. Once you made it to one you took the time to observe yourself; the principal was right about looking nowhere near ready for work. Thankfully there were some breath mints nearby, so you took one and almost instantly you felt your morning breath dissipate almost instantly. Next thing to do was your hair; you took the comb nearby and ran water through your hair, combing out the kinks and applying a little bit of gel afterward. You straightened your clothes out and was about to leave until a terrible cramp hit you, forcing you into one of the stall to vacate all the stinging waste inside of you. Despite having emptied yourself on the can, your abdomen and privates still stung a little like you were burned by something. Curious, you lifted your shirt and saw\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026a violet pentagram drawn onto your stomach, leading all the way down to your crotch. Wondering what the fuck you did last night, you pulled your pants down and saw that this purple line dip into your ass and spiral up your penis, which looked raw. In a flash, everything came back to you, the girls and their chanting, Angela stealing your virginity from you and laying a curse, everything else they did afterward, and the pain from the memories returning forced you to your knees screaming. Not too soon the principal came rushing in asking if you were okay, and she froze when she saw you exposed. You looked to her, eyes pleading for some sort of answer\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

You went from lowly janitor kicked out from his own home just barely making a living to some demon girl's manslave for the rest of your life in less than a week, and how the principal could act as if nothing happened was beyond you. The principal's eyes softened seeing the miserable state you were in and sighed, and with strength you didn't know she possessed she slowly lifted you to your feet so you could see each other eye-to-eye.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very well; of all people I suppose you most of all have a right to know what is happening. Just\u2026freshen up a bit more and meet me in the teacher's lounge after school is over. There, I will tell you everything you know, and\u2014more importantly\u2014how we are all going to move forward with this situation. But, I must ask you to promise me one thing: what we will discuss in the teacher's lounge is to never be spoken of with anyone but us, understood? Everything depends on it.\" What an ominous thing for the principal to say to you, and you knew that whatever it was it was big\u2014bigger than all of you if you had to guess. Still, if you wanted to get to the bottom of it all, it was better for you to trust in the principal on this, and slowly you nodded your head in agreement. \"Thank you. I promise you that everything will be revealed to you about this school, the students, and the role you play in all of this. Forgive me, but I must be leaving now; all of this paperwork isn't going to do itself. Oh, and don't worry about any work today; just take it easy until then alright? I don't want you pushing yourself to exhaustion.\" The principal bid you farewell and went about the rest of her day, leaving you to yourself to mull over everything she told you; you'd finally get some answers behind all the strange happenings going on thus far and what to expect moving forward. With the okay to take it easy for the rest of the day, you decided to spend it waiting in the teacher's lounge until school was out for the day. With not much else to do, you ended up dozing off despite downing a cup of coffee, patiently waiting for the day to end\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"\u2026lo\u2026\" you heard someone say. You didn't feel like getting up to see who though, you were just so comfortable where you were at the moment. \"\u2026up\u2026Ple\u2026up\u2026\" There was that voice again, and it sounded familiar. Curious, you began stirring in your tiredness and strained to make out the owner of the voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please\u2026wake up\u2026\" That sounded like Aim\u00e9e; almost instantly you shot up, regretting that decision immediately as you feel the strain of having crashed out on your body. Slowly, you opened your eyes and found Aim\u00e9e's sweet face staring into yours with the most concerned look you had ever seen her with. She gasped when she noticed that you were finally coming to. \"Daddy! You're up!\" The girl hugged you tightly, just about squeezing the life out of you, before she lessened her hold and smiled at you. \"I was so worried about you Daddy\u2014you looked really sick!\" Did you really look that terrible? In any case you ruffled through the girl's hair assuring her that you were going to be okay, and that's when you noticed that you two were not alone; Li stood at Aim\u00e9e's side, and behind the two girls were the principal along with the other teachers and staff. Then you remembered that this was the teacher's lounge, wondering why Aim\u00e9e and Li were there.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, you are finally awake,\" the principal said. \"School had ended just over an hour ago. All of the students and their parents have since returned home, leaving us here to discuss some sensitive matters.\" You were still curious about the two girls being there before Aim\u00e9e suddenly lifted your shirt up. You could see her solemnly looking over the mark on your abdomen and felt an especially cold chill run down your spine as she ran her hands along your body. Eventually she dipped her hand into your pants, almost caressing your testicles and stroking your penis.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Phew,\" Aim\u00e9e sighed in relief. \"Looks like the damage wasn't severe\u2026 Good thing I gave you my lucky charm before you went to see Angela huh?\" You briefly remembered Aim\u00e9e's lucky charm that she gave you yesterday, and sure enough it was still around your neck. Aim\u00e9e was just talking about how the damage wasn't severe, and it made you think that maybe the trinket really did save you from a worse fate. But then, you thought, that must have meant Aim\u00e9e knew that something was horribly off about Angela. Uncomfortable about what you would find out next, you cautiously asked Aim\u00e9e if she knew that Angela was some sort of demon girl. Aim\u00e9e didn't immediately answer you and looked away, but you could see her steel herself and look at you as if she wasn't a little girl but a grown woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, I knew,\" Aim\u00e9e said in the calmest voice you ever heard. \"Like I said to you before, the day you and I met at this school was the first I had set foot here, so I had not yet met Angela at the time. The next day when Angela and her followers met us, I could feel this overwhelming fell power emanating from her, and when she spoke of meeting you in the selfsame restrooms we had met, I knew that she was plotting something. With Li's help, I crafted an antihex charm to help ward off the worst of Angela's witchcraft, and fortunately I had predicted right that she would try to enslave you. I am so sorry that I could not be upfront with you until now, but I could not risk the wrong people finding out about the truth.\" You were left speechless by everything that Aim\u00e9e told you; you already knew that this girl wasn't normal from the get-go, but you never imagined that she had anything to do with magic\u2014not the phony stage magic you often saw out on the streets, but actual honest-to-God magic and sorcery and witchcraft and the like. You asked Aim\u00e9e if the two of you meeting in the restroom was planned out, and she shook her her. \"No, I had not planned that. I really did need to use the ladies' room, although it would not be strange to say that perhaps our meeting was preordained after all.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You see, Aim\u00e9e here is no ordinary girl,\" the principal spoke up. \"She is a being far above many others in this world. You see, Aim\u00e9e is actually\u2026an angel.\" Your eyes widened upon the admission; as far as you knew angels were the stuff of myths. \"It is true. Many of our kind must conceal our true identities to operate undercover, and Aim\u00e9e here is no exception.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I believe you saw my wing tattoos when you were washing my back yesterday morning,\" Aim\u00e9e added. \"In truth, they are my wings\u2014sealed away through magic in the form of tattoos. Though I was surprised that you had spotted them, after spending more time with you I knew that I could trust you with that information.\" That explained why Aim\u00e9e seemed so apprehensive when you brought it up. \"In truth, I had also been testing you,\" Aim\u00e9e continued. \"As I looked into your eyes when we first met, I knew straight away that you were no ordinary person; wanting to see if you could be trusted, I played the role of an eccentric child and looked for your reactions. I must say that you were quite the gentleman, and I must admit it was amusing to watch you fumble about in embarrassment over a little girl exposing her intimates to you.\" You asked her if she really was a child or if she was merely taking the form of one. \"The answer is yes and no. As I am an angel, I have walked this world before the first signs of life came to be, but for an angel my body is still\u2014as humans would put it\u2014prepubescent. Li is very much the same as I albeit a tad younger, and the staff members of this school are older still.\" While you heard the principal mention \"our kind\" when talking about Aim\u00e9e being an angel but you weren't exactly paying attention to that part. The revelation shocked you that all of the staff were angels too, and hearing that Li was one helped explain how she could help Aim\u00e9e make her charm. You wondered if the whole school was full of angels and demons and whatnot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No,\" the principal answered. \"As a matter of fact, excluding all present in this room, there are only six other angels amongst our student body. They are not present at the moment due to needing to take care of other urgent matters. As for Angela and her group, there are not precisely demons per se, rather they are witches; Angela is the fallen angel among them and thus possesses exceptional powers.\" A fallen angel\u2026this was starting to sound more outlandish the more you heard, but none of it still really went into the exact role you played in all of this. \"Ah, of course. Well, the role you play into this is actually quite simple; as Aim\u00e9e said you are no ordinary person yourself. You are in fact the reason Angela and her ilk are here and why they targeted you; what you are is key to their ambitions for this school.\" For a lowly janitor you sure seemed to be of great importance; this was starting to sound like one of these fantasy novels, and in the back of your head you were wondering if you were being elaborately pranked. \"Sir, what I am about to ask you if of great import for us angels; it is a great undertaking but I assure you that we will be with you every step of the way. May we ask for your assistance in protecting this school from the likes of Angela? If not, I can understand your apprehension if you fear for your life, but I assure you that there is no place safer from those who wish to harm you than St. Adelaide's K-12 Academy. In the end, the choice is ultimately yours.\" If what the principal was telling the truth then it was best that you stayed with them, but even so the thought that this was all some sort of joke would not let you make the choice easily. Everything was resting on your choice now\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

In the end, after much contemplation, you came to the decision of\u2026staying to protect St. Adelaide's K-12 Academy. Aim\u00e9e stared deep into your eyes with an analytical gaze as if searching for doubt or deceit. After a moment of silence, Aim\u00e9e finally spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Are you truly certain that this is what you want?\" she asked you. \"If you are unsure about this I implore you to think through it more carefully. Your life will be at constant risk should you continue to stay with us; we cannot guarantee your safety anymore than we can know the future. Should you choose to leave us\u2026we will respect your decision, and I will craft you a charm that will help shield you from Angela's attempts to find you, but know that it cannot be all-powerful so you must take all that is important to you and run as far as you can.\" You had already made your mind up and explained this to Aim\u00e9e. Whatever it was that Angela had done to you, Aim\u00e9e and Li (and likely the other women as well) saved you from completely being Angela's manslave for the rest of your existence. You essentially owed your life to them, and more importantly than that was that you sincerely wanted to help them protect the school from those witches however you could. Besides, you had grown quite fond of them all, and they were honestly some of the best people you had met in your life since the disaster that was your breakup. Lastly, even if you did run you'd have to live the rest of your life in paranoid fear that Angela or one of her witches would find you and by then you would be doomed without Aim\u00e9e or the others to come to your rescue. With all of that in mind, you said with finality that you were going to stay with Aim\u00e9e and the others for them and the sake of St. Adelaide's K-12 Academy. This resoluteness surprised everyone inside, though while everyone else could only stare at you in stunned silence, Aim\u00e9e was smiling brilliantly from your declaration, and god was her smile contagious; you found yourself smiling right back at her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" Aim\u00e9e spoke. \"I can see in your eyes that what you say comes right from the heart, and for that I thank you. Thank you for choosing to walk down this path with us\u2026with me\u2026\" Aim\u00e9e climbed up to the couch you were resting on to keel face-level with you, and then she leaned into you\u2014arms wrapped around to your back\u2014for a deep kiss. Your eyes flew open from the sheer softness of her kiss\u2014lips warm and moist pressed against yours but seeking no passionate entry\u2014and you closed your eyes as you leaned against the couch, simply basking in the feeling whilst wrapping your arms around to her own back. You could hear an \"aww\" or two from the others but all you could focus on was the heavenly sensation of Aim\u00e9e kissing you. Soon Aim\u00e9e pulled away from you, and when you opened your eyes you were met with quite a sight; Aim\u00e9e's appearance had changed\u2014her golden locks no longer flowed freely but were now done up in a double dutch braid bun high on her head, her flooffy pink princess dress was replaced with a slimmer sleeveless dress of white with hot pink accents and golden trimmings, and most importantly was the fact that a sun-like halo shone from the back of her head while shimmering wings of white sprouted from her back with a hint of pink at their bottoms and sky blue at their tops. You were left awestruck at this angel kneeling into into you, still with her arms wrapped around you. \"Well now,\" Aim\u00e9e said, \"I must look simply divine for your gaze to be so captivated by my true appearance\u2026\" You were simply frozen speechless, unable to form a coherent response at what you were looking at, but you did the next best thing you could think of: pulling Aim\u00e9e back into you and giving her a deep kiss of your own. Aim\u00e9e did not seem surprised by the sudden gesture, moaning into the kiss in pleasure. You prodded your tongue against her lips, a way of asking her permission for entry, and permission was granted as her lips parted and you felt her velvet tongue acquainting itself with yours. A little ways into that spit-swapping, your hands traveled further south until they reached under her dress and stopped at her hips, feeling her moan into your mouth a little more as you rubbed against her bare bottom-half. Slowly, her arms left your back and her hands rested at your chest, and little by little you felt the growing lust inside you fading as your hands left Aim\u00e9e's sides. \"At ease now,\" Aim\u00e9e said. \"We will have more favorable opportunities to consummate our love in the future. For now, I believe it is time to divulge to you more of what we are to do now that you have joined us.\" Aim\u00e9e lightly tapped your lips with a finger and stepped down from the couch, allowing you the chance to straighten yourself before the girls. You could see that all of the other females in the room had also changed appearance, each with a different style of attire, halo, and pair of wings with wildly different colors sans black.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now that you have joined our cause, we must fill you in on the situation at hand,\" the principal said. \"I will not lie to you sir\u2014we are outnumbered in this struggle against the likes of Angela. Truth be told, she is not the only fallen angel here in our school and the witches who serve her are also not the only ones among their kind here, but she is by far the most dangerous fallen angel. From what I understand they seek to undermine humanity and ultimately use it as a sort of battery to draw power from, and from there they will extract their vengeance against the heavens who cast them out. Me and Amore\u2014known to you as \"Aim\u00e9e\"\u2014were the first to found this school centuries ago, both as a means to gather more girls to safeguard them against the machinations of Angela and to secure ourselves a base of operations of sorts to plan our strategies against these rogue angels and witches. The men are too easily susceptible to the witchcraft Angela and other fallen angels employ, so we only allow girls here since they are more easily able to resist her spells while the men would are all too likely to disrupt our ability to deal with the fallen angels, and the less girls Angela can get her hands on the better of a chance we stand against her.\" You nodded along with what the principal was saying, but the part about men being too easily swayed by Angela stood out since you yourself are a man. You voiced this to the principal wondering how you are supposed to be any different.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are substantially different from all of the other men,\" Aim\u00e9e\u2014or rather Amore said. \"I shall reveal that to you in due time, but know that you are able to resist Angela's witchcraft at all, moreso with my antihex charm with you.\" That put you at ease at the very least, though now you were wondering about how you all were going to stand a chance against Angela if you were all truly outnumbered, but again Amore was there to reassure you. \"Do not worry, we are all not alone in this struggle.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not all witches and fallen angels here are malevolent,\" the principal explained. \"In general there are three kinds of witches here: white witches who have developed and strengthened their faiths to make use of light-based magicks to heal the stricken and strike down the wicked, the black witches who study the world intensely to hone their nature magicks for combat, and dark witches who commune with fell spirits and strike contracts with them in exchange for some of the darkest witchcraft. Within our ranks against Angela we boast many black witches but few white witches and even fewer dark witches. As for fallen angels not aligned with Angela, we are rehabilitating them so that they may regain a semblance of their former grace. When that happens they will no longer be able to be swayed by Angela's more extreme witchcraft, and with them on our side we can hope to thin down the numbers of rogue angels.\" From the sounds of things, it seemed as though your group were going to wage some sort of war against Angela and her witches, and you wondered if the rest of human society would end up getting dragged in the middle of it. Worried, you voiced this to the angels, hoping that it wasn't going to come to that. The angels looked solemn for a moment with no one answering this question until Amore spoke up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As much as it pains us all,\" she began, \"a silent war will not happen between us because Angela will never allow for it; worldwide war is inevitable. Lives will be lost as Angela and others aligned with her will stop at anything to achieve their goals. We will do our best to minimize the casualties that will happen, but that is the best we can do\u2026\" That was a bleak admission from such an angel, but a part of you was expecting it. Lots of people and animals alike were going to be caught up in the fighting, and you can already see the collateral damage and casualties piling up horrifically. If Angela truly was that dangerous, then if you were going to be of any help to Amore and the other angels then you were really going to have to step your game up as quickly as possible. Right now though, you were still awfully tired from the night before and you just wanted to go home and rest to let this all sink in before making any other sort of move\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

You'd have to begin your training with the other angels tomorrow for sure, but until then you needed to recover from the nightmare that was last night. The angels all seemed to understand this, and without you having to tell them they gave you their graces.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Say no more sir,\" the principal said. \"It is plain to see how exhausted you are from Angela's treatment of you. I would advise that you get your rest for tonight; you will need it for the many days to come. We shall see you and Amore tomorrow.\" By the principal's leave you slowly got up from the couch, taking Amore's hand into yours and bidding the other angels good rest of the evening. With all of the other students gone, it seemed like the two of you would continue on to your house in peace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Truly, I cannot express how grateful I am from the bottom of my heart that you choose to stay with us,\" Amore said. \"I had convinced myself that perhaps this was not something you were meant to be caught up in, but from the moment I had laid eyes upon you as Aim\u00e9e I knew that you were something special. It helps that you are quite the gentleman when it comes to intimate affairs\u2014not once did you dare to chance a peek at my nubile form for your own pleasure despite my numerous exposures to you. I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for you to deal with the likes of how I had behaved.\" It was as difficult as it could be to not make yourself out to be some perverted creeper into little girls; you had enough heat as it was coming from the police force as well as Angela's twisted schemes. \"Now, however, I daresay that I would not mind showing off more of myself to you when the opportunity is right~\u2026\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my, what's this?\" came a familiar voice, dripping with mischief. It made your blood run cold as a dull ache reverberated throughout the pentagram on your abdomen. Despite not wanting to look the voice's owner in the eye, your head turned anyway to find Angela Viktorov and her witches, disguised as regular students as usual. Her smug grin was insufferable to look at, but before you could say anything you saw Amore stand between you and Angela. \"Wow, I never knew that you were such a bold girl Aim\u00e9e. Hate to break it to you, but I already called dibs on him\u2014got him a nice body tattoo to prove it. Speaking of, how do you like it my special design? I think it's a good fit, wouldn't you agree?\" As intense as your newfound hatred of Angela burned in you, you dared not make a bold move against her to avoid another mishap like with yesterday. Amore was far less hesitant to confront Angela however, and she moved in your defense.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We know what you are plotting, Angela,\" Amore said. \"You shall not have him.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, look at that, you finally decided to show your true form. I guess this means there's nothing else for us to hide is there? Drop your disguises girls.\" An inky blackness covered Angela and her group save for their glowering eyes, and in a snap it cleared to reveal their transformed states from the previous night.  \"Judging from the sheer shock on your face this must be your first time seeing our real selves in all our glory\u2014we make for quite a fetching group no?\" Sure, Angela and co. were still very pretty but draping themselves in bones and smearing streaks of what was likely blood all over them like sigils made them look very much like demonic savages.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you after here Angela?\" Amore asked. \"Know that if you have come for a fight then I shall\u2014\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh can it with the low-key jealousy already. I'm just here to\u2026see off my new boy-toy. Now step aside girlie.\" Angela raised a hand, and before you knew it you were being yanked toward Angela through the air. Despite Amore's attempts to help you she was barricaded by Angela's witch club casting a wall of dark magic, leaving you and Angela one-on-one. \"Don't worry, I share my toys, and I'll let you borrow him until I need him back okay?\" With that Angela took flight and held your chin in hand, eyes inspecting your face as she wets her lips. \"Mmm, but you are a cute one; you look so good and sweet I could just eat you alive. Now, gimme some sugar\u2026\" Somehow your mouth was forced upon and her tongue began its invasive intrusion. However, it wasn't long before Angela recoiled and spat at the ground. \"Ugh, disgusting! God\u2014you taste like diabetes! I bet it was that little angel over there\u2026 Oh well, maybe I need more protein in my diet~.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next thing to happen was nearly a flashback to last night; Angela dropped your pants straight to your ankles and took the time to marvel her handiwork with your shirt lifted up as well. Smiling, she started off with a few tentative licks at one nipple while squeezing at the other one, all while massaging your ballsack.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You perverse fiend!\" Amore yelled out. \"Unhand him right this instant or I'll\u2014!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw shut up and let me play with my toy in peace. If I can't even have that\u2026\" Right then Angela was harshly clutching your testicles in her hands, drawing out a pained yelp from you. You could see that Amore was ready to attack until just then, visibly struggling with not attacking Angela. \"I have to warn you; I tend to get real aggressive when I'm mad and, well, break my toys\u2026beyond repair. Screw with me and you won't get to play with him either.\" A part of you wanted Amore to be ruthless right now and screw Angela off of you, but the pain in your ballsack convinced you otherwise. Amore herself quickly relented, allowing Angela to have her fun with you for the time being. \"Sheesh, quit acting so pissy and just let me have a bit of fun for a bit yeah?\" Angela resumed her molestation up until you were erect enough for her. \"And now for the main course\u2026\" The fallen angel quickly took you into her mouth, sucking you off like a lolipop and delighting at the shameful shudders coaxed from you. You knew that you weren't going to last long; whatever else Angela did to you made you more receptive to her technique, but instead of letting you finish in her mouth she pulled off and simply stroked you until the climax came all over her face. She was clearly loving every second of it, relishing in the seed  splattered all over her face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, yes,\" the fallen angel purred. \"I could get used to this~\u2026\" Somehow, Angela was magically sucking all of your jizz straight from her face into her mouth, licking her lips afterwards. \"Now, let me give you something to look forward to.\" Angela stuck her middle finger in her mouth, slathering it in her spit before she reached down under the front of her dress. A second of eye-rolling moaning later she removed her hand and placed it behind her dress. She bit her lips and grunted for a spell, and then she finally removed her finger. Of course, she promptly shoved that finger right in your mouth, swishing it around on your tongue. You did your best not to recoil given what she had her finger up, and worse was how pungent the taste was. \"There, now you'll always know what you're missing out on without me.\" Angela removed her finger and finally let you go, dropping you flat on your ass with the magic gone. \"Come on girls, let's leave these two losers alone.\" They miscreants all cackled and vanished in a swirl of dark storm clouds. With them gone, Amore quickly rushed to your side to inspect for any further damage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you alright?\" she asked as her hands worriedly roamed about you everywhere. \"Angela did not do anything extremely foul did she?\" Aside of fingering both her snatch and her ass from what you could guess and shoving that in your mouth, you reassured Amore that it didn't feel as extreme as last night. Still, Angela could have cast some sort of spell on you since the taste of her nethers wasn't going away so soon. \"Let us get you home quickly before Angela and her witches harass us more.\" Amore quickly disguised herself under her \"Aim\u00e9e\" identity ans she led you through the school gates. The walk home was uneventful, largely due in part to Amore scanning both your surroundings as you focused on making it back home. Once the two of you were finally in, you shrugged off your coat and shambled your way to the couch as Amore dispensed with her disguise. You were just about ready to call it a night and proceeded to shed the rest of your clothes before Amore came to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ready for sleep already are we?\" she inquired. \"Surely you are not planning on sleeping on your couch again?\" Flustered, you tried to avoid telling Amore that you still hadn't washed your bed since the last you used it, but it seemed like she was having none of it. \"Come now, do not feel so embarrassed to share a bed stained with your semen with me. We will, after all, do so in the future.\" That didn't do too much to alleviate the awkwardness of it all but for what it was worth she didn't try to tiptoe around it. \"Also, it would be more difficult for you to have a good night's rest without a warm, refreshing bath would it not? Worry not about your bed, I'll tend to it; you just focus on your bath and your bed will be ready for you when you are finished.\" You were about to question how but Amore was an angel\u2014she had her tricks and ways, and so you went into the bathroom for an overdue soak in the tub. Much like the other day when you had met Amore, the bathwater was a perfectly warm temperature despite maintenance saying the hot water would be out for some time. Once the water was drawn you slipped inside the tub and was immediately hit with a wave of relief as the warm water washed over you. You couldn't remember the last time you felt this good, and it was likely thanks to Amore that this was possible. Shortly your mind drifted to the angel who had shown you so much love and helped improve your life since you met her\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

This was the sort of outlandish fantasy you could have never dreamed of even in your wildest imagination, and you honestly hoped that things didn't get even crazier than how they were now. Despite effectively getting thrown into a war between supernatural beings because of becoming the slave of the very fallen angel waging that war, you couldn't find it in you to be too freaked out; it very likely would have been worse without the divine intervention of your new guardian angel Amore. Her compassion for you was as clear as day and the thought of someone caring about you so sincerely made you smile. It had been a long time since someone had actually shown you any unconditional love\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thoughts of you and Amore spending time with each other flooded your mind as you relaxed further into the tub\u2014things like amusement parks, eating out at fancy restaurants, trips around the world, making love under the sheets, growing old togeth\u2014<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026Right then and there you just remembered that Amore was a very old, long-lived angel. In her own words, she walked the Earth before the first signs of life had shown themselves. She had likely done everything there was to do and then some\u2014including the possibility of having multiple partners in the past. You immediately smacked yourself (lightly) for that thought; you didn't want to start feeling bad thoughts over Amore sharing her bed with others. She was an angel\u2014she likely had lots of lonely nights to herself and wanted to spend those nights in others' warmth. Still, you couldn't help but feel that you wouldn't be the most special to her even now; chalk it up to typical guy feelings wanting their girl to love them more than any other dude, but that was the general feeling creeping into your mind. Absentmindedly, you started to hope that if you didn't somehow end up immortal by the end of all of this, that you'd at least manage to make some sort of lasting impact with Amore.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You heard gentle knocks on your bathroom door, snapping you out of your thoughts to awkwardly allow Amore to come in. The door fell open to reveal Amore in the same dress she wore earlier, casually walking her way over to take a seat on the closed toilet lid next to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How are you?\" she asked. \"Do you feel any more refreshed now that you are bathing?\" You nodded in that you felt a little better than earlier, though the exhaustion from last night and today's encounter with Angela hadn't completely left you yet. \"Ah, it is good that you are recovering. Here, I have some bath bombs that should soothe your sore body.\" From the way she spoke she sounded like she was your live-in nurse than the daughter you had just adopted yesterday. You graciously accepted the bath bombs and dropped them in the water, watching them fizz. \"Your bed has been taken care of, so when you are finished here you will be able to sleep in it soundly and comfortably.\" You thanked Amore for doing you a huge favor and she replied in kind. You started to feel the soothing effect of the bath bombs and wondered aloud if you could just lay up in the tub all night, earning a giggle from the angel. \"I would not advise it. Getting too comfortable in the bathtub could lead to deadly results, but rest assured as long as I am here it will never come to that.\" You laughed at how blunt Amore warned you not to get yourself killed in your own tub, and for some strange reason the mention of death got you thinking back to how long-lived Amore was. You wondered if Amore had boyfriends and such only to lose them to having their times tragically cut short.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What is troubling you?\" Amore asked. \"Your eyes are cross with unpleasant thoughts. Anything I can help with with?\" You looked into the angel's eyes and debated whether or not you should bother her with something that was probably trivial to her only because you couldn't rest easy without knowing more. Not wanting to lie to her, you hesitantly let her in on the things that were bothering you: your short lifespan compared to hers and the likelihood of her having had previous partners who are all probably deceased by now. You wondered if there was anything you could actually do to bring her any joy in life that she hadn't already experienced\u2014if you would be a good partner for her. You tried not to, but you found yourself recounting memories of the time you spent with your ex-girlfriend and the tragic but inevitable break-up you two had, resulting in your disowning by your father and being cast out to live on your own. You never meant to tell Amore so much so soon, but you couldn't stop yourself somehow as if talking to Amore got you to open up about yourself more than you ever did with anyone else. Your love clearly wasn't enough for someone like your ex-girlfriend so how would it be enough for an angel of all things?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You looked into Amore's eyes again and you didn't find any sort of patronizing pity, disappointment, or amusement like what others in your family had for you when you were being kicked out; she looked at you with gentle understanding, completely impartial almost, and then she leaned forward with her hands on the edge of the tub.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You never need worry about whether your love will be enough for me,\" she said. \"I have experienced many things, yes, and I have had my share of partners in the past as well, but what truly matters is whether your heart is in it. I have often found myself disappointed by purely carnal lovers, both man and woman, but for those who were truly willing to spend their lives with me out of true love\u2026I will forever cherish those precious times. I have been with those who feel the same way you do\u2014those who feared that I was 'too good for them' or that they didn't love me the way I loved them. I will say to you what I have said to them\u2026\" Amore knelt on the floot and closed the distance with her hands on your face, one cupping each cheek as she let the light of her eyes flow into yours. Instead of saying anything, she instead leaned in for a kiss, and from that kiss alone you could understand everything she would have said, all contained in that kiss, without having to say a single word. You melted in the feeling flowing between you two, that you finally found someone you could openly love from the heart, and you returned that pure kiss with one of your own. You two sat for a spell, pulling your lips away to smile at each other. You took Amore in your gaze; what was she if not an angel of love\u2014if not love itself. You wished that this moment would last forever\u2026and then you nearly go under from slipping on your own ass in the tub. This understandably shocked the two of you, but all you could do afterward was laugh from the unintentional moment killer. Maybe you had been in the bath for too long; besides that you were sure that you were pruning by then so now was a better time to get out before you shriveled up too much. You were just about to get out of the bathtub until you remembered that you were naked in from of Amore. Even if she had given you an impromptu testicle fondling earlier, the gentleman in you forced yourself back into the tub, not wanting to indecently expose yourself to a clothed lady so crudely. Amore giggled at this display.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come now, I will not be offended by the sight of your penis,\" Amore said. \"Perhaps the lack of sexual intimacy has made you hesitant in displaying it for me? I would rectify this but I fear that we would not get much rest if I did. If it helps, I will not look and stare.\" You almost felt like a little kid but it couldn't be helped. Carefully, you extracted yourself from the bathtub and grabbed for a towel to dry yourself off before slipping your boxers on. Now dressed for rest, you led Amore to your bedroom, and though you briefly remembered that you hadn't washed it, the knowledge that Amore took care of it for you pressed you onward. True to her word your bed had been immaculately tended to with the sheets and blankets fresh as early snow. You were almost tempted to jump on it like a kid just to feel its softness, but you restrained yourself in Amore's presence to be grateful for the work she did with your bed\u2026only for Amore to dive right into it nearly screaming \"wheee\" in the process. You eventually came to tell yourself \"oh what the hell\" before following suit, causing Amore to fly into the air from your impact. She landed back down laughing along with you, taking some time to calm down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am so very glad that you are someone I can share in my fun with,\" Amore said. \"It makes the time we spend together all the lovelier, though I must admit that even I can fear for our future together. The future is unknowable, even to us angels, so death could claim you at any untimely moment. But\u2026even then, I will not let that hold my love back; I will keep my eyes ahead on the path of this uncertain future and brave it with you\u2014hope strong in my heart.\" Amore took your hand into hers as the two of you lay under the covers, and you could feel the gentle warmth from it. \"Goodnight, my love\u2026 May we walk forward hand-in-hand to meet this future, and may we know love and happiness, now and forever\u2026\" You bid her the same for night and let your eyes be closed, waiting for when sleep would find you and awaiting the next morning light\u2014no longer worried for the world of tomorrow, but now welcoming the dawn of a new life from this day forth\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Strange as that is, you welcomed the warm reception from the staff proud of you to have fulfilled the prerequisites (which was no small feat mind you). In time, the student and staff body alike come to adore you as their precious janitor, and you've earned a bit of a celebrity-like status. However, disquieting rumors from the neighboring community seem to be trying to get you landed in prison or worse, though neither student nor staff are having any of it and adamantly defend you from the others. One day, though, upon a chance encounter with a young student at a time and place you weren't meant to meet, you'll find that the institution is far more than what meets the eye\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story revolves around you and the students and staff who seem perfectly normal yet reality itself seems to bend to their will to an absurdly inhuman degree. Luckily some of these females are nothing but kind, though there are others who aren't so sugary sweet. While there will be a sort of \"default\" story involved that branches off from the first chapter, ultimately it's up to the readers to decide what path they wish to follow themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow are the general set of rules and, fair warning, they may be strict:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you start a route, be sure to leave at least one empty slot for another person to start their own routes\u2014mark your routes that you do not wish to be disturbed as \"reserved\", especially if you can add up to three or more extra routes, and respect others' \"reserved\" routes by not hijacking them\u2014this will include myself as well regarding the \"default\" canon. However, if you have a \"reserved\" route and it has not been worked on for at least a month or two (or I suspect that you have been inactive for that long period), I will free it up to the best of my ability for others to use it. Likewise, if I have not acted on a \"reserved\" route in the specified time feel free to use it yourself. As an addendum to this, I will remove the \"reserved\" mark on chapters I have completed and hope that others will do the same with chapters they have finished as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you are going to end a route, please do so on a route you \"reserved\" for yourself and not on others were there is no such \"reservation\".<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While I will not disallow any sort of sexual fetish, I will not tolerate out-and-out rape made out to be \"enjoyable\" for the victim in any fashion; if I see such writing it will be trashed immediately. Rape fantasy thus should be written very carefully to make sure that it is entirely consensual on both party's ends.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While not a \"rule\" per se, please take care to write with proper grammar, though I understand that sometimes it can be difficult if you do not speak English or some other language you're writing in as your first language.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another thing is that while this isn't an outright rule it should still be considered; I enjoy stories with heart put into them; even if it is just about the janitor \"conquering\" all the females at the school I would like to encourage all of you to put some care into it to make it enjoyable to read. Short entries will be allowed on a case-by-case basis; chapters should be about four to five sentences long (which themselves should be about four to five words long).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since this is an interactive story from the reader's perspective it would be expected that most entries are written from the reader's point of view and what actions they will take next; the janitor will be male by default but changing his sex and/or gender is still perfectly acceptable for those who do not identify with a male/cisgendered protagonist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules may change and be adjusted to entries added here and there but that should be about it for now. I bid you all a well writing experience. I will add gift points for satisfactory entries for as long as I have gift points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></td>",
