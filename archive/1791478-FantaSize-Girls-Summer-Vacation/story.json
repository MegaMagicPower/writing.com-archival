Sitting in a booth at a local restaurant they considered their options. Thanks to Amanda, money wasn't a problem and she wanted to show her new friends a great time. Of course that didn't stop her from still wearing the second version of her shrink ray, a wrist band that could alter her size, or anyone else's. If anything that would just add to the fun of their vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So, where are we going to go?\" Amanda questioned the girls who were looking through travel guides spread out upon the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Roxy, who was sitting next to Misery, shoved her friend over towards the window and grabbed at a book she was holding onto, \"This sounds interesting! I've never been on a cruise before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Grumbling Misery pushed back and let Roxy keep the book that she was now staring at wide eyed, \"You haven't been out of the state Roxy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amanda grinned up from her big round rimmed glasses, her short cropped blond hair glowing in the early morning sunlight, \"Now now girls, don't fight. Whatever we decide I'm sure it will be wonderful. I've got a few more options here. A camping trip, a tropical resort, even a day at the water park if we want to take it easy and leave tomorrow instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm all for camping,\" Misery replied, \"At least then I won't be fully in the sun all week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Is that a goth thing?\" Roxy immediately chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Misery sighed, \u201cNo Roxy, I just don't like being in the sun all the time. I'm not even really goth, I just wear dark clothes a lot. Sheesh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amanda's eyes dart to Roxy's, \u201cShe didn't get much sleep again last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cDoes she ever?\u201d Roxy replied receiving another playful shove from Misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cSo ladies, what's it going to be?\u201d Amanda questioned as she leaned forward, her glasses gleaming in the sunlight.</span></div></div>",

We'll go with your idea and go camping,\" Roxy decided putting her book down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was slightly taken back by Roxy's idea that Misery was the one having a bad month but she kept her words to herself writing off the comment as a social science she could study through Roxy's actions later, \"Camping it is then. I know just the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girls were off in Roxy's parents beat up old station wagon that afternoon. They took only what they needed and it just so happened the camp Amanda had in mind was starting that day. The camping grounds were pretty open and relaxed, giving everyone a chance to do what they pleased instead of constant planned events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camp however was on that the girls would be sharing a cabin with others. This intrigued Amanda, making her eager to see what the new girls would do when they found some of the shrunken people she still had stored away. Never mind what they'd do when they too became shrunk if Amanda so chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few hours they pulled up on the worn old sign of, \u201cCamp Natalie\u201d that stretched across the dirt roadway. Misery had turned back to Amanda in the back seat who was playing with a shrunken football player in her hands. She asked why the camp was called Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's the name of the lady who runs it. Camp Natalie is an all girls camp for those around our age,\u201d Explained the scientist, not looking up from the tiny man in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy looked up into the rear view mirror, \u201cIt's a camp for bitter high school drop outs like us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you Roxy,\u201d Amanda corrected, \u201cI graduated with honors years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl in the front seat said more as they pulled up on the main circle of cabins surrounding a small garden with a flag pole in the center. Amanda was out of the car almost instantly running up to a very tall girl with long white hair that almost had a blue highlight to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey embraced tightly and the blue haired girl in a camp shirt and shorts stamped down to the car in her high heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoxy, Misery, this is Natalie!\u201d Amanda was grinning broader than they'd seen her before. It was nice to see the frustrated scientist happy for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello you two, it's a pleasure to meet you!\u201d Natalie offered in an excited tone that made Misery feel even more exhausted then she usually did. \u201cYou can pick any cabin you like. They all have their own theme and unique set of campers. We have three openings in each one, so feel free to choose whatever you like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda turned to Misery, \u201cWell, this vacation was your idea. Where are we bunking?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Phoebe was a bit shorter with spikey blond hair and a light dusting of freckles on her cheeks. Shelly's hair was short cropped and black, shining in the bars of sunlight from the emerald canopy of leaves high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're done sizing us up, maybe you're in for a game?\" Phoebe asked, grabbing the ball away from under Tara's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda wandered past the girls and into the cabin calling back, \"If you two want any of the 'small candies' I brought with me to take along with you, they're in my nylon lunch bag.

A girl with long brown hair and small rimmed glasses peeked up at her from a hand held video game and looked right back down. Not sure if it was concentration or shyness Misery offered the first hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! I'm Misery and these are my friends Roxy and Amanda. We'll be bunking up with you,\u201d she offered, stamping a booted foot down on the front step of the cabin next to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red head from a nearby open window perked up and smiled to them, \u201cDon't mind Jill, she doesn't talk much. I'm Lauren and Rachel is back in her somewhere. Probably reading her moms notes from home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop making fun of me!\u201d A voice called from the back of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked back, \u201cIf I was making fun of you I'd tell them about your stuffed animal collection that you've taken up your top bunk with! You're the oldest out of all of us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey always argue like this. My parents say it's good for me to get out and meet new people though. I'll introduce myself when I'm done my game,\u201d Jill softly spoke, not looking up from her hand held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy's hand clapped down on Misery's shoulder, \u201cGood choice! At least these three should be in bed by nine every night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning Amanda pushed her way passed Misery and Amanda, almost stepping on Jill's game case next to her, she trod up the stairs into the cabin, \u201cThis should prove very interesting indeed.

She didn't know exactly what it was, but there was something about that shy girl that intrigued her. Amanda walked up behind Jill and proceeded to watch her game from over her shoulder. It was a typical platformer game, very similar to Mario games in overall appearance. Jill was focused on her game intensely, and it seemed as though she didn't even notice that Amanda was watching over her shoulder. After a few more minutes, Jill finally finished getting through the level she was on in her game. Saving the game and shutting it off, she slowly turned around to look at Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you watching over my shoulder?\" Jill asked in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ummm... I was just curious about what kind of game you were playing\" Amanda responded, somewhat surprised that Jill had noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, it's nothing special. Just a normal game that I play every now and then. I'm still waiting for the sequel to come out, so I've been playing this one over again in the mean time.\" Jill replied, sounding somewhat bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... That sounds like fun and all, but how would you like it if I showed you something even more entertaining than some outdated videogame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill simply sighed and put her handheld away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically it isn't outdated until the sequel is actually released, but whatever... I'm actually getting pretty bored playing through the same game for the 5th time, so what do you want to show me?\" Jill said, beginning to sound a bit curious near the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda just smiled at her new friend and reached down into her bag. Moments later, she pulled out a shrunken boy from her school's football team. Jill only stared at the tiny boy with a very curious expression on her face, clearly baffled by the sight of this 3 inch tall football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he real?\" Jill asked, sounding surprisingly calm despite what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I shrunk this little sucker myself!\" Amanda answered excitedly. She couldn't wait to see how the shy gamer girl would react to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Jill simply stared at the tiny boy for almost a full minute before responding:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just be careful they are quite fragile,\" Amanda warned as she handed over the tiny football player. She was much more interested in seeing what Jill had in mind rather than the tiny guys safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   However it even shocked Amanda to see what happened next. The tiny guy was dropped down into this girls soft padded palms, staring up at her inquisitive eyes gleaming through her small rimmed glasses. Then suddenly he found himself licked up by her massive tongue into her giant mouth without a second though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Stunned and speechless Amanda took a slightly hunched over startled pose and just stared at Jill as she began working the shrunken football player around in her mouth with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cYeah she does that,\u201d Lauren explained from the window, having watched the whole situation play out. \u201cI hope you're kidding around, cause she tends to eat whatever goes in there. After she's done playing around with it first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A slow grin spread over Amanda's face. She expected this of a toy or something, sure. If the girl had some oral fixation, no big deal. But this was a shrunken living person that this girl just popped into her mouth like candy! She wasn't even playing attention. Jill was just leaning back on her hands and staring up at the canopy of leaves above the cabin while she worked the tiny guy around with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Meanwhile inside the shy girls mouth, the tiny guy was desperately trying to cling to her slippery tongue and finding no success. He tried to keep away from her teeth but she didn't seem interested in using them to bite into him, yet. They were tightly closed and he only occasionally thumped into them. Otherwise he was forced forward and to the roof of her mouth, being licked again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Misery and Roxy wandered up behind Amanda with curious expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cSo she does this often?\u201d Misery inquired, watching the girls cheeks as saliva must be being forced between her teeth to make them slightly buldge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lauren laughed and replied, \u201cYup! We've made sure to keep anything small away from her. Usually she just licks things but occasionally if she puts it in her mouth it's usually gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Roxy couldn't blame her. She knew the rush of feeling a tiny squirming in her mouth, struggling against her tongue. Jill's aimless focused expression as she stared towards the sky made perfect sense for how much attention it takes to play around with one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With the initial shock fading, Amanda started to look around concerned. The situation hadn't caused anyone else to come over and see what was going on. Even quiet Rachel was still somewhere in the back of the cabin. That was a relief. She didn't want to start mass hysteria. Things could be much more fun on a personal basis, introducing each girl to these shrunken people to see their reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now the question was, what would Jill do when she got bored of his weak struggles?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amanda watches wide eyed as she spits the tiny man down hard on the worn wooden steps of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A sharp crack sounds as his tiny body hits the step with quite a bit of force. From his perspective he looks up to see the calm expression of the girl who tried to eat him and Misery, Roxy and Amanda gathered around on the other sides. Tired and weakened by the experience he struggles to sit up but finds his body just won't cooperate. Helpless to do anything he lays back, watching the girls and hoping one will do something for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cBroken,\u201d Jill said softly, \u201cLauren, come down here and step on this will you? He's hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The tiny guys breath rushed as his heart began beating quickly in fear. He couldn't believe what he just heard. Didn't this girl realize he was a real person? Trying desperately to roll over he started clawing at the grain of the wood, struggling to pull himself towards the open gap under the next step so he could fall to freedom away from this crazy girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Instantly eager for feedback Amanda looked up to Lauren, \u201cYou wouldn't want to do that would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She came over from the window to the doorway and shrugged. Amanda's eyes darted down to see Lauren's bare feet that looked pretty dirty from wandering around the cabin and woods. Considering the tiny football player was now trying to pull himself free from a small puddle of saliva it was going to be messy to have her step on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Jill slid over so Lauren could walk down the stairs next to her. She looked up expectantly at her friend, squinting in the sunlight and pushing her glasses back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amanda leaned back to her friends, \u201cWow, I thought you were cruel Misery but this girl is just careless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cShe's an amateur. When you don't know what they are it's easy to do this stuff. Give her a few more and we'll see how cool she is,\u201d Misery whispered back, \u201cAnd we're not going to be playing with these all camping trip are we? I'll dump the bag out here and squish 'em all if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cThat won't be necessary. I'm just having some fun,\u201d Amanda grinned at Misery, \u201cThanks for the offer though. I'm glad to see you're still feeling good about all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lauren wiggled her toes, drumming them against the wooden planks of the top step, \u201cSo is everyone okay with this guy going smush under my big dirty feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The gamer girl simply looked down at him through her small rimmed glasses and said, \u201cYeah, I don't want to eat him and he's obviously hurt. Just have some fun with it, it's kinda neat how he fights against you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'm not impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was starting to frusterate both Amanda and Misery. They didn't want to shrink anyone right out in front of the cabin. Lauren for one would have completely lost it the moment Jill dwindled away and that other girl back in the cabin would surely freak out too. Then again on the other hand there was nothing saying they couldn't just shrink them all and take over the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Roxy, get over here,\" Misery called her friend over.

She hid behind a row of bangs that hung almost over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Rachel said flatly, glaring up from her letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda glided over and sat down softly on the bed... which creaked and groaned showing the age of the springs that barely held it together. Her dramatic entrance gone, Amanda still smiled sweetly to Rachel and said, \"I'd like to be your friend. I know what it's like to miss your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel raised an eyebrow and tucked her letter into an evelope and then into the nightstand drawer beside her bed. \"Really? You just got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... Parents arn't around anymore,\" Amanda began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Rachel blinked, her bangs being tugged gently by her long eyelashes, \"Oh I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting up her hands, Amanda calmed the girl, \"You didn't know. Now, you're having problems here arn't you? I'd say you've probably always had problems with girls like Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching her fists against the blanket, Rachel tugged up two handfulls of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda slid closer and put her arm around her, \"How would you like to get back at someone like Lauren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked surprised at first and hugged her knees to her chest but slowly her eyes went from staring at the dusty floorboards to finally looking back up to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would I do?\" She asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda reaches into her lunch bag and pulls out...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't prepared for the blinding light when Amanda unzipped and opened the bag high above. She stared down through her huge glasses, blue eyes scanning for someone specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his breath when those giant eyes locked onto him and were replaced by the huge fingers of the scientist girl. All the others in the bag moved back away from the grasping hand, leaving poor shocked Bill there to be snatched up into Amanda's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld within her soft grasp, tightly into the spongy warm flesh of her palm by her arching fingers, Bill awaited his fate. Outside he heard Amanda muffled voice talking, \"I bet you've put up with a lot from all those jocks at school before. How would you like to get back at one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA secondary voice, also female replied much softer, \"Oh, I don't know if I could hurt someone. You didn't bring anything dangerous to camp did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the fingers around him opened simultaneously. Amanda's grasp released and Bill found himself sitting in the palm of the blond girls hand staring up into the titanic face of a very surprised girl. The bangs of her tied back black hair created slashes of shadow over her round cheeks and small rimmed glasses. Looking down over the gap between two of Amanda's fingers he saw the girls slender body stretching out far below. She seemed to be wearing a tee shirt from some camp and a pair of short black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell back again and looked up at the two looming faces staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he real?\u201d The other girl gasped in surprise, looking up to meet Amanda's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, the giant blond nodded, \u201cHe sure is.

It took him awhile to figure out exactly what was happening, even after he hit the ground with a tiny thud to the two girls many times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I'm sorry Bill. I see to have... accidentally dropped you,\" Amanda smiled down at the football player. She really didn't care. He was always a jerk to her. Constantly yelling at her outside of school and in the hallways. It didn't help that Amanda tended to wear her lab coat at school even on summer days, but it still encouraged her even more to add him to her shrunken collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was stunned and leaned right over, looking down at the tiny guy between her feet with dark blue painted toenails. Her wide eyes stared down at the tiny form that lay there, softly panting from his injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't too sure what all was wrong with him, but he knew his legs wern't working right and the rest of his body was jarred painfully. The fall hadn't killed him, presumably because his tiny size put less force on his body. Either way he didn't know what to do as the massive toes just a few yards away wiggled against the old hard wood floor. Beyond that, he saw the underside of Rachel's bunk bed. It's inviting shadows could be a wonderful place for him to try to escape if we could crawl there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda high above was encouraging Rachel about what she should do though, sparing only occasional glances down to Bill to make sure he wasn't trying to escape. \"He looks really hurt Rachel, you should probably just put him out of his misery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe!\u201d Rachel shrieked, \u201cYou did this to him. I don't even know what he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's a football player from school, shrunken down. Simple as that. No one knows where he is and now he's broken beyond help. You're the one with the pent up anger, why not take it out on him? He's always treated girls like us badly,\u201d Amanda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel brought her huge feet up on their tip toes, almost pulling them under the bed as if she was afraid for them to be near the tiny man, \u201cStill, he's a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a person in terrible pain. Would you rather leave him there? Any number of things could come along and eat him up! That would be even worse than just simply being stepped on by your cute feet,\u201d The blond scientist continued to encourage as she leaned over and stared down at Bill with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing exactly what Amanda was doing, Bill frantically tried to claw at the floor. He hoped he could pull himself to freedom under the bed before this nerdy girl make up her mind to plop one of those giant feet down on top of him. It was some kind of game to Amanda and he'd been there when Misery's apartment was littered with a bunch of his classmates. Fortunately he was grabbed up and put in a jar by the flustered goth girl but shortly after that he found himself captured by Roxy when she came to visit and now here, picked up by Amanda again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight blush Rachel was actually beginning to wonder if it would be so bad. Her feet had just been resting in bed all morning and they weren't even damp with sweat. It would be a simple thing to do. She didn't mind the idea, and Amanda was right, he was hurt badly.</span></div></div>",

I'm glad you're not letting me do it. I get kind of wrapped up and play with them too much with my toes. It really ends up hurting them more. I dunno, maybe I'm shy and I just can't do it right away when I get my feet on them,\u201d Amanda lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Rachel hoped that she wondered if she'd have the same problem once his tiny hands were touching the sole of her foot. Really she felt like doing this just because Amanda was the only one on this trip that had treated her this nicely. The camp councilor didn't pay much attention to her and besides from Jill sharing her snacks while she gamed the late night away, camp had been boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rachel's right foot crept forward away from the bed and rested flat on the floor near Bill. He looked over and hoped that her massive foot would land upon him near her arch, which seemed big enough for him to at least squeeze under. He doubted it though as her foot pivoted up on it's heel and the wide ball of her foot hovered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there was no hope of escape now, Bill looked up to Amanda and then frowned. He'd never seen the nerdy science girl looking so happy. She was eager for him to get crushed by this complete stranger he'd been staring into the face of only moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if this doesn't finish him off?\u201d Rachel suddenly asked, her toes bending upward and smoothing out her sole high over Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put an arm around her new friend, \u201cDon't worry Rachel, it will! You just gotta make sure to position the ball of your foot right on top of him and when you've got him good and pinned, then you press down really hard and grind him into the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh! That sounds so mean. Isn't there an easier way to do this?\u201d The quiet girl asked, getting nervous again and hugging her teddy bear tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. We could leave him down on the beach, but getting eaten by a seagull would probably be much worse than just being squished. Plus at least it's by someone so nice and sweet like yourself. You're doing it because you care about his suffering,\u201d Amanda continued to encourage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone cares about my suffering,\u201d Bill said to himself, far too tiny to be heard down on the dusty floor. The toes above him had begun to wiggle absently as Rachel discussed Bill's fate with Amanda. He couldn't help but stare at the giant sole as it wrinkled gently overhead. With each scrunch of her toes, her sole became a plush ceiling of fleshy folds. He hoped that would be what she stepped down on him with, imagining that it wouldn't hurt him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel twisted her foot out of the way to see Bill still laying here, \u201cI'm really sorry about this. I'd have caught you if I could have. I'll do my best to make this as quick as possible.\u201d With that, her foot blocked out the wooden rafters high above again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't even like it when I step on one of Jill's gummy candies. But I guess this is different,\u201d Rachel pondered, mostly to herself it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile under her huge waiting sole, Bill couldn't believe what he was hearing. If anything he was in a lot of pain and in need of help not being squished. He struggled to continue scrambling back out of the way but instead he just seemed to be positioning himself directly under the pad of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's hand squeezed Rachel's shoulder tightly as she watched on. It always intrigued her how differently people reacted to these situations and Rachel's quiet apologetic approach was much different than Misery's usual hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy girls giant foot stayed still for a moment and then her sole slammed down hard on her target. Rachel's foot landed flatly on him and she felt a slight pop like a grape being crushed under her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed there for a moment, unsure of what to do now. Obviously she'd want to wipe her foot off but on what? Rachel felt awkward, knowing that they couldn't have fixed up the tiny guy but feeling guilty for being so mean to him too. Considering what he must have been watching, she thought to herself that maybe putting her sandals on would have been a better idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless it was done and Amanda's eyes were scanning Amanda's face for any signs of what she was feeling. She was eager to ask lots of questions, but wanted to determine exactly what reaction Rachel was experiencing beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took it from the fact that Rachel's tight hug on her teddy bear seemed relaxed now that she wasn't panicked. That was a good sign. At least if she wanted Rachel to do more like this. Maybe not here though. After all, they had the whole camp grounds to enjoy toying with Amanda's shrunken captives in, or even making some new ones. That Lauren girl after all seemed to be teasing Rachel quite a bit. Amanda grinned, considering how funny it would look to see a shrunken Lauren dodging the footfalls of Rachel's cute feet stomping amongst the stuffed animals in her top bunk, helpless to escape besides a massive fall to the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond jumped when she realized Rachel was staring right back into her eyes, \u201cOh! So how was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need a tissue. Do you think he's squished?\u201d She asked quietly but not really upset by the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed and produced a tissue far too quickly from the side pouch on the lunch bag containing the other people, \u201cWould you consider doing that again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be the moment to really gage if Rachel was having fun or not, Amanda assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know. It seemed okay, and he needed us to help him. What do you mean?\u201d The nerdy girl asked in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda leaned in and whispered her next idea to Rachel.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She needs to be put in her place.\" It took all the self-control Amanda had to stop a demented smile from forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea alone made Rachel's eyes widen in shock. \"S-Shrink Lauren?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda quickly placed a finger on Rachel's lips, \"Shh! Not too loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink Lauren?!\" Rachel repeated at a much lower volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist nodded, \"Yeah, admittedly I haven't seen much of her, but it looks like she treats you terribly. I can give you a shot to show her who's the boss around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that to her!

You could lay your foot on top of her, but you don't have to kill her! Just show her how you feel about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel averted her eyes, \"I don't know\u2026it still seems pretty\u2026mean\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde scientist laid a hand on her new friend's shoulder, \"Trust me, as mean as you could be. It would never come close to how mean she treats you. I mean, I honestly feel sorry for you having to deal with someone like that all the time. Believe me, I know how it feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shy girl looked back into Amanda's eyes, \"Y-You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded, \"Yeah, they were one of the first people I ever shrunk. Playing with them\u2026it was probably the best day of my life. It made me feel so much better about everything, and they learned their lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026You seem so sure\u2026I guess it can't hurt.\" Rachel finally gave in with a slight hug to her teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled, \"Alright! Give me a little bit of time. I'll bring her here!\" She quickly headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrinking down Lauren was incredibly easy. A lot of the girl's in the camp seemed to keep to themselves, or at the very least, keep to their respective cabins. So when Amanda had traversed through half of the camp grounds and found Lauren, she was all alone. For whatever reason Roxy wasn't around\u2026knowing her she probably went to go do something. For whatever reason, it worked out perfectly. With another step Amanda's sandal crushed a twig, Lauren quickly veered around to see the scientist walking towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Uh\u2026Amanda right? What're you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took another few steps forward, \"Nothing much, just looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Mild surprise shined in the not-so-shy girl's eyes, \"Why? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde scientist felt her heart begin to eagerly pound as she instinctively reached a hand for her size-changing wrist band. \"It's about Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Lauren's face died down quite a bit, \"Oh\u2026Is she whining again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually she wants to try and make things up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren shrugged, \"It's not like we're enemies or anything. I just have a little bit of fun with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled, \"And now it's her turn to have fun with you.\" In a single swift move, Amanda aimed her wrist band's shrink ray and hit Lauren with it. In mere seconds the girl went wide eyed as the world became hundreds of times bigger in 10-seconds flat. She stopped shrinking at a puny inch tall; having shrunken so fast she was currently in too much shock to fully grasp what had just happened. With something of a demented smile the blonde scientist stomped her blue sandals right in front of Lauren, forcibly bringing her out of her shock, to the sight of five toes about her size. Each toe wiggled eagerly with a desire Amanda had to just crush the shrunken bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like bullies\u2026\" She explained, \"In fact, I tend to crush them like the bugs that they are.\" Amanda raised her left foot for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all Lauren fell to her knees, speaking with the shrunken voice that could barely be heard. \"Please no! I'm sorry Amanda! Just don't crush me! I swear I'll-\" She was cut off by Amanda stomping\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026right in front of her. \"I really want to crush you\u2026but I'm not evil. If you prove to me you're not such a bad girl. I may let you live.\" The demented smile Amanda always got from toying with shrunken people was as apparent on her face as the glasses she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How?\" Whimpered Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda wiggled her toes, \"Well\u2026I think what bullies really need is some humiliation. So why don't you show me that? I think kissing my toes would be a great way to start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no hesitation in Lauren as she quickly ran to Amanda's people-sized toes and starting kissing each of them. The fear of a death from the scientist's blue sandal was enough to scare away anything that would remotely hinder her humiliating actions. Each toe tasted of a salty mixture of sweat and foot; a taste that, however brief it was, made Lauren wish to gag. Amanda chuckled as yet another tiny submitted to her, like all the others had before her. They all died of course, but it wasn't Amanda's place to kill this one. That was for Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another quick movement, Amanda bent over and plucked the small girl from the ground with her fingers. \"Not bad\u2026I think I'll let you live\u2026<i>for now</i>.\" It was hard to tell whether or not Lauren was relieved, not that Amanda even cared. She casually slid the girl into her bag along with all of the other tinies and with nothing left to do, the girl turned around and began heading back to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Amanda had gotten back, it had been roughly 30-minutes. Rachel looked as if she never moved from her bed. Her teddy bear now rested beside her on the bed instead of in her arms, but the nerdy girl seemed more focused on her feet. No doubt she was probably envisioning a small Lauren near them, or perhaps even just admiring the fact they had the power to take a life, with hardly even an ounce of effort. Rachel's gaze quickly shifted to Amanda when she returned though, \"You're back! Does that mean\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you a little present!\" Amanda grinned as she reached into her bag. Out with her hand came Lauren, who she laid out on the wooden floor before Rachel's bare feet. The timid girl grew silent as she stared at the tiny bully. Not even an hour ago Lauren was taller than her, now she was shorter than her toes. She had to poke Lauren with a toe to make sure she was real; the small poke was enough to knock the woman over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren\u2026?\" Rachel asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes Rachel?\" Lauren responded, clearly fearful by her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God\u2026\" Rachel cupped her mouth as a gasp escaped. Amanda leaned against the bed Rachel was on, intently watching how the next few minutes would play out. How Rachel would react to Lauren so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the initial shock settled down Rachel finally began to act. Rachel\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

High above, Rachel's left foot shuffled back on top of the mattress as she hugged her other knee for support and leaned back slightly to make sure tiny Lauren didn't go splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cI don't like the things you say to me Lauren,\u201d Rachel softly commented, her foot staying quite still as he toes slowly scrunched over and over. To Lauren this was quite an ordeal on it's own. The plush pad of Rachel's foot expanded with each wiggle of the giant toes over top of her and the massive sole below wrinkled eagerly with the movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With tiny shrunken hands, Lauren began pushing slightly up against Rachel's foot. All she could really do was move the blanket of flesh up slightly, and letting it go usually caused it to push down tightly against the shrunken girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With a quirky little smile Rachel was starting to feel better about this, \u201cWell, not so smart now are you? Don't you want to make fun of my massive size now? I'm a big mean giant girl and you're a bully who's trapped under my beautiful giant feet.\u201d All this was said very softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amanda noted the wording. She was right, Rachel had been admiring her feet silently. The scientist couldn't complain either. Out of all the girls here she preferred the idea of Rachel stepping on the tiny people. Her feet were slightly plusher than the others and were sure to be soft. Even though they were sure to be sort of sweaty in this heat and on Rachel's bed, they were pretty clean and smooth too. No real harm was coming to Lauren and Amanda was enjoying that. It kept both of the girls focused instead of Lauren needing to worry about any physical pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cPlease Rachel! I'm just having fun with you. It's not like I was being serious. It's just jokes!\u201d Lauren tried to explain, tears coming to her eyes as she tried to shuffle out between the nerdy girls toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rachel's eyes flashed suddenly in surprise and she squeezed her toes down lightly on Lauren's shoulders, \u201cDon't try to get away now. We're talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cWell talk so you can let me go! I'm sorry!\u201d Lauren pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Wanting to keep the situation going Amanda leaned in, \u201cI dunno Rachel, I think she'd say anything to get out from under your foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lauren looked up to Amanda and softly asked, \u201cWhat should I do then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cI don't know. You could always make a game of it. Maybe put Rachel up on your top bunk amongst all your stuffed animals that she made fun of you for and let her hide under them while you try to find her with your feet. Or of course you can just do what you did to Bill and squish her horribly under the giant sole of your bare foot,\u201d detailed description always made Amanda's pulse rush and betrayed how excited she really was avoiding showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Of course hearing this Lauren was now struggling like crazy. Hearing that Rachel had already done something so horrible turned this innocent game into a fearful real problem. Her foot had already doomed someone and the nerdy red head wasn't going to take this laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amanda pulled back, realizing she was squeezing Rachel's shoulder, \u201cSo, what do you think? Don't forget how she made you feel. You're in control now. She didn't have to be mean to you, and you don't have to let her get away with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cI thought you said I could just play with her,\u201d Rachel hugged her knee a bit more again, her shy attitude coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The scientist girl gave her twisted grin, \u201cWell that's up to you. I don't know if I can return her to regular size,\u201d Amanda lied, \u201cSo if you don't look after her, she just might get stepped on by someone else. If it's gunna happen it may as well be under your cute feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rachel blushed, unsure of what to do. The idea on her bunk sounded good, but letting Lauren go on the floor and hunting her down sounded like fun too. As long as someone else didn't step on her like Amanda warned about.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She moves the tiny man into her left hand with the girl and goes over to the scale and bends down. She lays both tinies where her feet would go and pulls on the tape as she looks down at them. The sound of the tape stretches out as she makes in longer than their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure not to move or try to escape if you make me mad you're gonna be in a world of pain.\" Misery told the two as she laid the tape on the midsection of the guy, pinning his arms to the ground making only his head and legs movable. She takes another piece of tape about equal size and pins the girl who was a bit more squirmy and made some air bubbles through her struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I said no moving! I guess you get to go first.\" She said as she looks at the small blonde with excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\" The girl asks frightfully. Suddenly her eyes shrink as  a tall shadow invelopes the entire scale and the only thing she could see is the darkened Misery raising her bare naked foot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word of warning these feet smell REALLY bad so you might wanna hold your breath.\" Misery said before the girl could get the chance to inhale she quickly moves her sweaty foot onto the girl and on the scale making the little weigher spin around.

Now she had another group of four and finally her own size remote to be able to shrink anyone on the ship she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking down into her bed Roxy pulled the tiny people out of her jean shorts pocket in her soft hand. She felt them squirm but was too busy ignoring them as she pulled off her grimy sneakers. It felt good to get them off and press her bare soles to the cool white sheets of her cabins bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much care for them, Roxy dumped her handfull out onto the bed. She still really didn't see them as people, but moreso as something to have fun with. They stared up in horror as the giant girls sweaty feet positioned themselves to bare down upon the tiny people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group under the shadow of Roxy's left foot cringed as they saw their other two companions get stepped on by the giant punk girls right foot. A moment of silence followed as the reddish pink haired girl smiled down at her foot. The sound of seagulls and the calm rush of the ocean outside were all that could be heard in the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sudden burst of movement, Roxy's right foot rose from the other two sending them flying into the air after being stuck briefly to the girls foot by the moisture on her skin. They cartwheeled in the air and landed lightly back down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought the two tinies that had just witnessed this realized that Roxy's left foot was about to fall upon them. They dove away but one only succeeded in getting grabbed by her toes and drug back under the ball of her foot as she scrunched her toes over and over, shoving him back where she wanted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a group of two girls and two guys at the giant punk girls feet. They seemed to be in their fourties and fairly well dressed. Maybe Amanda had grabbed them when they were out for lunch downtown. They seemed like business people. Roxy didn't care much, she just thought it was funny that the one woman had lost her heels and now was kneeling in her stockings staring up in shock at the vicious step she'd just endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked worse for wear with torn suits and dishelved hair. There was no escape from this gigantic girl. All they could do was hope that she'd come to her senses. However, Roxy was having too much fun for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure under her foot was pretty great, holding the tiny people down against the cool sheets of the bed under the radiating heat of her bare sole.

It was all she could reasonably expect from a single-occupancy cabin without paying more exorbitant rates; it was about six feet across, with a bed on one side, built-in desk on the other, a sink, and small bathroom. Perfectly serviceable for a week's stay, and more than adequate for the task at hand. That task, of course, being revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid her luggage under her bed; there'd be time to unpack later. She took the time to remove a single small wooded box, which she placed calmly on her desk. Removing her socks and shoes, she sat in the chair, and opened the box. Inside the felt-lined container were six tiny people, each one inch tall. They were all young women, dressed in a matching assortment of short skirts and shirts festooned with a school logo. As she loomed over her terrified captives, sunlight gleaming off of her glasses, Amanda gave a smile that could chill the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd given Misery and Roxy whatever poor souls she'd had lying around, for their own amusement. But these...no, these were special. These women had taunted and teased Amanda for longer than she cared to remember. They'd made her life in school a living hell. If Amanda didn't already harbor deep misanthropic tendencies, the abuse she suffered at this cheer team's hands would surely have been enough to inspire some within her. She'd denied herself proper justice on these preening witches for some time, telling herself that she had to space out her fun with the tinies she truly hated, lest she run out of them too soon. Like a fine wine, she needed to savor them for special events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat better occasion than a vacation to indulge in some overdue payback? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Mindy,\" Amanda whispered, knowing it would still be very loud to her prisoners. \"Girls. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy was the head cheerleader, although Amanda had to admit she didn't know the names of the others. It was Mindy who singled Amanda out, Mindy who'd constantly ridiculed and assaulted her. The others were complicit, but Mindy was most guilty in Amanda's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy, a strawberry blond with a perfect, if minimized, body, stared up at the comparative giantess with terror, and even a little confusion. \"I...Amanda? What happened? You...you have to help us!\" From the poor girl's perspective, this was too much to take in. The team had been meeting for a regular summer training session yesterday morning, when there had been this disorienting, blinding light. When it cleared, the six of them were in this dark, impenetrable box. And now, freed after who knows how long, everything around them looked enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to do anything?\" Amanda hissed. \"You're not in any position to make demands! School's out, and I'm calling the shots, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy took a moment to digest this. What...what was going on? \"You...did you do this to us? Turn us back right now, or I'll...I'll call the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, yeah. No. No, I don't think you will,\" Amanda chided, eyes lighting up with malicious glee as she watched the ramifications of their position sink into her captive's faces. \"Your adorable matching iPhones are far too tiny to transmit or receive a signal. You can't get off of this table at your size, or leave the room. And if you did...well, you don't even know where you are. Quite simply, my pretties, I'm your God, now. Will I be a merciful, loving God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned absolutely terrifying, as her eyes were lost entirely by the sunlight on her glasses. \"Well. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mindy had been able to eat anything in the last twelve hours, she'd be vomiting in terror. As it was, she was already pale as a sheet, and her knees were just about as sturdy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but why?\" she managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like you really have to ask,\" Amanda snapped. She slammed her fist on the desk, which sent all six of her prisoners toppling over with the force of the impact. She'd had enough preening over her victory. Time to play. She'd save Mindy for last, but she needed to make an example of one, right now. Lifting her fist off of the desk, she hovered her hand over them, licking her lips in anticipation. As her face flushed slightly, her free hand slid under the desk, to her lap. She pulled back the elastic strap of her skirt, along with her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eenie, meanie, miney, mo,\" Amanda teased in sing-song voice. \"Who will be the first to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer from her cowering captives, she suddenly grabbed a girl, gripping the screaming young woman firmly between her thumb and index finger. Retracting the hand, she released the girl in mid-air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo those on the desk, crying out in horror, it looked as if Amanda had just dropped the girl to her death. But then they heard the telltale elastic snap as Amanda's skirt went back into place. The demented purr of satisfaction Amanda gave as her eyes fluttered slightly confirmed the terrifying truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's a fighter, that one,\" Amanda breathed, squirming slightly in her seat. \"So. Who's next?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda was riding fairly high at this point. Not only did she have one of her tiny slaves stimulating her as if her life depended on it, (which, really, it completely did), but she had five more tinies to play with, including one of her most hated enemies. The combination of sadistic power lust, physical pleasure, and intellectual thrill of knowing that it was her own technology that made it all possible...the blond mad scientist was practically in bliss. She briefly paused to wonder if it could possibly get any better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now that she thought about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached idly for her cell phone, her hand passing over where the reduced members of the cheer squad cowered in absolute mortal terror, convinced she was reaching for another of them. All things considered, this was a prudent assumption on their part, although incorrect in this exact instance. None of them wanted to follow their unfortunate comrade into Amanda's undergarments; the demented giantess's occasional small moans of satisfaction were a constant reminder of the poor girl's fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her prisoners for now, Amanda sent a quick text message to Misery, only one cabin over from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you busy?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited a few moments, until the reply came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was about to start playing with my tinies. What do you want?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ignore them. Come to my cabin. I've got something to show you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'K.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Amanda stood on (not surprisingly) shaky legs to answer the door, allowing the purple-haired goth inside. Misery was actually a bit annoyed at her planned games being interrupted, but Amanda hadn't steered her wrong before. Quite the contrary; she'd always been well-served by participating in the blond's experiments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's up?\" she asked casually, not immediately noticing the oddly distracted look on Amanda's face, or the blush in her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got someone special for us, Misery,\" Amanda announced proudly, leading her test-subject to the small desk. Misery's eyes lit up in recognition when she saw the shrunken cheer squad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...Mindy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her cronies, yes,\" Amanda noted. \"Right where they belong. At our mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of the towering gothzilla before her, Mindy decided to take a chance and beg for help. She doubted Misery would aid her; she barely knew the girl, but the two hadn't really gotten along in their few interactions. And if she was Amanda's partner in this madness, that boded even worse for her chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, hell, it couldn't possibly make things any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misery!\" she shrieked, sounding more like a \"squeak\" than a proper \"shriek\" at her scale. \"She's insane! A pervert! She dropped Jodi in her panties! It's sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisery raised an eyebrow, regarding her partner in crime. \"You dropped one of them in your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's blush intensified. \"Oh, like you're one to judge,\" she noted, eyes darting to the side for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she's still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded, smiling slightly. \"She's a fighter,\" she noted with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're kind of messed up, you know?\" Misery said, completely serious. After a moment, her expression broke, and she started laughing. Mindy's heart sank upon hearing this; it provided confirmation that the goth girl wasn't going to be sympathetic to their plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do with the rest of 'em?\" Misery asked, eying the girls on the table with a predatory glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda already had her answer ready.</span></div></div>",
