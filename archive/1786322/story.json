By appealing to the leaders, scientists ran tests and eventually, salt was the bane of the zombies, killing them entirely and miraculously, if salt was poured onto an infected wound, it would remove the infection. the donly downside was that people who have already turned can't be turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the military used salt bullets and other weapons filled with salt in order to kill the infection, and in over 2 months, the zombie infection had been eradicated off the face of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, some salt bombings in wild life areas such as the American Northwest or the Amazon was poisonous, due to it's properties. but the environmentalists shut quickly when it came down to their lives or the the rainforest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunatly, most of the rainforests were saved, and after all, society would rebuild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's the problem, the rebuilding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infection had wiped over 60% of the worlds population, the hardest being in China and the United States. But, the United Nations are doing their best to rebuild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Japan was able to recover from the tsunami and nuclear crisis, the world can too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the United Nations, now named the Global Assembly, have signed a bill into law that, has sparked religous controuversy and some moral questions. But, in order for the population to return to a stable number, the bill needed to be enforced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Human Recovery Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticle 1: A man between the ages of 17 until infertility must submit sperm on a weekly basis. The individual who does so is also rewarded a financial compensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticle 2 Section 1: A man of any faith must marry more than one woman and must have more than 5 children as a result of this. Anyone who raises 5 children or more are given tax breaks and financial compensation by their local government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticle 2 Section 2: All woman must be given the \"Cradling Infant Box\"(CRIB) vaccine in order to accomdate the birth of twins or more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticle 2 Section 3: All woman's breasts will be enhanced in order to accomodate the distrubution of milk. Woman who do so can be financially compensated for their time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have raised tempers amongst people of stout catholic faith and male homosexulaity, but their cries were unheard. The world needed to rebuild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi signed to take part in the Human Recovery Act in hopes to recieve money for schooling at the University of Hawaii(Japan was in shambles and his parents wanted whats best for him, so they sent him there) once he graduates from the local high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead he can see the girls. Kohta Hirano had gone on to serve in the JDSF and Alice and her dog Zeke lived with her grandparents in South Korea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls he decided to live with and recieve the benefits of the Human Recovery act, and they are all along their first month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaeko Busujima, Rei Miyamoto, Saya Takagi, and Shizuka Marikawa.

They were at least three sizes bigger than they were before. Her stomach had grown mch larger, and it was now at least 34 inches longer than it was before. While it still had a defined shape, it was a bit pudgy. This was the result of two different things. The first reason is that the serum that the government used to make women's breasts grow slowed down their motabolisim and made them much hungrier, which was the reason she was a bit fatter than she was before. The reason her stomach had a defined shape is because she was 4 months pregnant. Her face was also a bit fatter, and she was starting to grow a second chin. Her butt had also gotten a little thicker, and it was now covered in cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was....adequate.

The teachers would be stern or lenient. The exams are the most talked about subject aside from the so-called advancement to cure Parkinsons Disease at Kyoto U. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think that the cure prevent Parkinsons sure, but created something akin to turning someone into a lifeless flesh-craving fiend? And a single bite upon anyone by the infected would turn said infected into one of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot what Fujimi High Schooler Yuta Hayami had in mind as he rushed through the halls, hearing the screams of his fellow classmates behind and in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so much simpler then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was simply 18 years of age, a Senior who was ready to graduate with decent grades. Not enough to warrant a walk-on onto Tokyo U, but rather something like Fukuoka, Kyushu, or even Hokkaido up north. Hell, maybe even study abroad in America or even Europe or South Korea. He had modest dark hair, practically obsidian if any of his friends said so. His eye's were also a sky blue, and he looked \"above-average\" in looks, and he was average on his baseball club team, being an exemplary hitter, but bad with catching. Such was the purpose for a Designated Hitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his mayhem, this chaos, this upheaval of everyday life changed all of that. It ended, permenantly. As he ran with the baying and howlering crowdm he noticed a door and the shadow of a person in the window's reflection. And that person wanted out. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save me! Someone help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami noticed that the voice was female and he stopped. Staring at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for! Leave her! It's everyman for himself!\" said a student as he bolted past him. Hayami tredged through the crowd and opened the door, and a heap crumbled onto him. And his eyes rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most popular and attractive girl in school, Miku Yuuki. She slowly recovered and stared back into Hayami's eye's in surprise, before turning her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the door! They're climbing up the stairs!\" She barked. Hayami shoved Yuuki off of her and went to close the door. True to her word, he could see the monster's slowly climbing up the stairs, their groans haunting and skinned darkened and rotting, as well as their eyes rolled over. He shut the door and grabbed the light-orange haired girl's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" As much as he wanted to oggle her and her profound assets, survival is much more important than hormones, and Yuuki agreed as they darted down the hallway. They could hear the groan behind them and glass shatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head upstairs! Maybe we can find a way out from there!\" The buxom high schooler looked incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy! How can we get out if we go up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stairs lead to the 1st floor, so even if we go down, we will do nothing but encounter more of those things! And I know a secret escape route!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing, the girl followed the dark haired boy's lead, as they ran up the stairs away from the flock of students trying to burst the door down to get to the parking lot.</span></div></div>",

His blood ran cold, fearing that he may have just left himself and this girl he had saved down. He saw what appeared to be a broom to his left in a janitorial bin...The escape was just at the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay by me at all costs!\" He turned towards the orange haired girl. She nodded, although she was incredibly frightened by the incoming fiends. He didn't blame her. He grabbed the broom and readied, imagining if the undead teacher's head was a baseball...The fiend lunged and he swung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cracks, one the skull being split open as it smashed into the wall, dead for sure, the other the broom. And there was two more. He grabbed a mop and readied...And this time he swung as he heard the scream of Yuuki and the groan of the male undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't hit as hard as he did the teacher for fear of breaking it, but he swung against the neck, sending it paralyzed to the wall as he repositioned for a left hand swing as the final beast lunged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand ached as he tossed aside the shattered mop, but the dead undead was satisfactory. The paralyzed was still trying to get up. He could hear the breathing of himself and of Yuuki, standing behind him clasping his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Maybe there's still time. Let's go.\" And the two students darted down the hall, ignoring the slowly getting up undead they paralyzed. As they rounded a corner, they heard someone, someone alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Hayami knew that voice. He turned, and to his luck was the nurses office. He opened the door and there she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tall, at 176 centimeters, and she possessed blonde hair and yellow eyes much akin to Yuuki standing beside him. She was wearing a white dress shirt and brown skirt, and she turned and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it's live students! What are you doing up here!\" As she recoiled a little, the two students could have sworn that they heard a 'boing sound from her great big breasts, which surpassed even Yuuki's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sensei! We need get out of here! And what are you doing up here!\" Asked the orange haired girl. The nurse put a finger to her lips in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well~ I was doing my duties tending Haruka-chan, that soccer player, when all the screaming and yelling happened. She seemed to blush everytime I helped check her up though, and she swore that she would protect me or something. Then she darted out the door and I've stayed here, but outside alot of people are eating and biting each other! It's as if the world has gone mad!\" Hayami knew of Matsumoto Haruka, her being a lesbian, and she must have fell to \"them\" while trying to protect her somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet how come they didn't come through here? Was it because that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we need to get out of here Shizuka-sensei! There's no time and I know an escape route. Please come with me!\" The incredibly buxom nurse, Marikawa Shizuka, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay...anything is better than I suppose.\" As she ran towards him she tripped and fell onto Hayami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his face got a full on tackle of her great fun bags. Miku had her eyes raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry! This skirt is causing me some problems! Not a good running clothing piece.\" Shizuka rubbed the back of her head bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then take it off so you can move easier!\" Shizuka could gasp at Yuuki's suggestion. Hayami seemed to be enjoying the fluffliness of his reverse pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be indecent and-why are you changing?\" Hayami's shuffled his head and got a view of Miku, and oddly enough, she took off hr skirt and handed it too Shizuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine in my undies, just use my skirt if you're gonna have a problem.\" Hayami couldn't blink as he noticed that she was jearing white panties with red stripes, and he began to show red and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? Something's rising?\" Asked the nurse. Hayami immediatly shoved her off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and get changed. My car is nearby the escape route.\" He turned away as he could hear the clipping of Shizuka's skirt coming off and her putting on the green skirt of the Fujimi school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umph...a bit too tight around my butt...\" Hayami gave a deep breath, trying to control his hormones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we're done. Where is this route? Oh, and I never got your name.\" Pointed out Yuuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right what is your name?\" Asked the nurse, now donning the flimsy green skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayami. Yuta Hayami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hayami-kun, we better jet out of here.\" As the nurse and two students exited the nurse's office, they saw two unded at the stairwell where Hayami and Yuuki came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" And they trio ran, hitting the fire escape and rushing their way down. Thankfully, there was no undead at the bottom, nor out in the nearby alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\" Hayami felt a surge of responsibilty upon him. He was dedicated to one thing and one thing only. Survival. Not for himself, but rather towards his group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has Miku Yuuki, who was trapped in some stairwell where \"them\" almost took her. And as he looked back at her, he saw eyes of gratitude, and maybe, just maybe, the tinniest hint of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in addition, the female defination of a man-child, and a repeat offender of the \"boing\" noise coming from her great bust, Marikawa Shizuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were the hottest women Hayami have ever encountered, like if Odysseus of Greek myth was entrusted by the gods to protect the beautiful Aphrodite and Demeter, he felt that responsiblity fall upon to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the car, and he could see the fleeing people heading towards the city center, and some of the \"them\" chasing them down, and he could see a highway entry in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head that way!\" The girls agreed and got into his Hyundari 2005 Elantra, and Hayami put the peddle to the metal and drove, past people and and past \"them\", and onto the freeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving for 12 hours heading west, the Elantra drove off and into a gas station parking lot located in some town in the mountains, out of gas. The bloodspatters on the white car proved of him driving through the undead. They occuptants took deep breaths to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Asked Hayami as he stared back at the beautiful girls in the back seat. The front seat was filled with Shizuka's pack of medical provisions. \"The end of the world is upon us. We are in a canyon town which seems to be evacuated, and none of 'them'. And I...\" He looked past the deserted gas station. \"See either a mall or a shopping mart. A hotel is nearby but it may have undead. Where do you wanna stay for the night? I'm exhausted.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two pondered on Hayami's question, the options presented proving to have equal oppurtunities...and dangers. One one hand, the Mall had dozens upon dozens of supplies AND would be an excellent place to establish a base of sorts. Given how things were, many a people would want in on the mall and if they managed to take root there first, it could easily be a ticket to being head honcho of a much larger group. Every teenager's dream...sorta. However, depending on how far the chaos has spread, the mall would also be crawling with \"Them\" and wouldn't exactly be the safest of areas to lay down for the night. The market proved to be an equal in this respect as it too had loads of supplies (mostly in the form of food stuffs and other consumables), but was more likely to have a higher concentration of the undead given how it was an area where many people congregated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left the Hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we go to the hotel.\" Miku spoke up, rising out of the defunct Elantra and fixating her gaze on the sturcture of interest. \"It's a good place for the night, and maybe something else~\" At that moment, Hayami turned to Miku, noticing a change in her tone and saw her sharp eyes gazing at him in a lustful manner. Miku was known to be quite the minx among the students at school, a promiscuous personality to compliment her volumptous figure. To say the least, it's earned her some rather \"odd rumors\" among the student body, but to Miku they mattered little to her. Desire and pleasure were what she liked most, and if it felt good to her, then why fight it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, r-right. Sleep is good, yeah.\" Hayami stuttered, already catching wind of what Miku was getting at with her comment. He wouldn't be opposed to the idea indulging on that lust she was giving off, but he'd rather figure out where they would go in the morning once all of this passed and maybe come up with a battle/escape plan in case \"They\" decided to ruin the little moment of rest and relaxation they were about to partake in. \"That alright with you, Shizuka-sensei?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, I'm okay with it~\" The chesty nurse nodded with a smile, having gotten out of the car and trotted to the front to take her medical supplies in hand. After adjusting the pelted skirt that was wrapped snuggly around her wide hips, she peered toward the destination of interest wondering on one thing that may prove to be a huge problem. \"But...what do we do if those zombies are there? Do we go someplace else or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami's expression dropped, having forgotten that the zombie chaos could have very well spread to this area, even if it was fairly remote and removed from the area where they experienced it. For all they knew, this area where the entire thing started from although...it looked deserted for now, at least at first glance. Even so, what Shizuka pointed out was a question the lot of them would have to ask themselves when ever they came across a new area and, depending on it's importance, they might have to force their way in. With this in mind, Hayami made his way to the trunk of his car, opening it up to reveal a pile of junk that accumulated within the small space thanks to Hayami's laziness pretaining to cleaning it out. Now, however, it would prove to be the ideal freebie for getting some starting weapons for his group. \"We'll have to hang out in the other places then...we're not really equipped to fight alot of those things,\" He answered, taking a metal bat in hand and squeezing it in his palms. \"But, if there's a few of'em, like say maybe two or three, we might be able to take'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku turned her glance to Hayami just in time to see hear him call out to her and see him toss her something. Flinching a bit to bring her attention to the object, she stumbled a bit, but managed to get a hold of the object and saw that it was a blue tennis racket. \"What do you expect me to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...fight with it, I guess. But only if you're cornered and I can't get to you. You're gonna need at least something to defend yourself in case things go south.\" Hayami really didn't want it to come to that. For one, Miku didn't look like she had any physical capabilities that allowed her to fight off an attack from one of Them that, and, he had already grown a little...attached to both Shizuka and Miku. It would kill him to see one of these lovely women fall victim to what many others had to suffer to in this slowly changing world. \"Sorry, Shizuka-sensei, I don't have anything for you to use...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Hayami-kun. I don't think I'd be very good in a fight.\" Shizuka said, already having to convince herself that the many people they were running over to get here weren't...people anymore. As a doctor and someone who harbored an almost child-like disposition, Shizuka couldn't really bring herself to kill another. However, if she were to survive alongside Hayami and Miku, she had to keep reminding herself that the zombies were to be killed. Nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, if everythin's all sorted out, let's head to that hotel and get some sleep.\" Hayami announced as his body rejoiced for a chance to finally relax, especially given the fact that he might not get this same chance if thngs got worse. The high schooler and his two beautiful companions made their way to the hotel, Hayami quickly being reminded that Miku was in her underwear as he tried not to stare at the rounded peach of her plump bottom as they walked forth, awaiting to see if their chance to get some rest had to be earned by defeating some of Them first...</span></div></div>",

They might as well punch their tickets to the River Styx...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...second floor or lobby level? We should have some higher ground against those monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lobby level,\" said both of the girls, Miku with an uneased pitch to her voice after hearing Shizuka's explanation. Nodding, the trio walked away from the elevator and onto the hallway of the lobby level rooms. The got to the first door and tried opening but it wouldn't budged. Then Hayami hit his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, room key.\" This caused the other girls to giggle as Hayami ran down the semi-darkened hallway and into the lobby desk, seeing the lobby level room keys, he just grabbed the entire box and jogged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try these and-\" He yawned. It was nearly 11 at night. \"Get some sleep.\" And suddenly he heard the growls of the stomachs, from both his own and the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but we are so hungry...\" moaned Miku in a voice that could not help but relax the black haired teen. And given how tight those panties are around her body he could see-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls can settle in, I'll uh...grab food and supplies, like flashlights and what not,\" blushed Hayami as he turned his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be okay?\" asked Shizuka in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be okay. You have no need to worry about me.\" That was enough to reassure the nurse. Hayami gave the box to Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use these keys to try and get inside this room and maybe others for supplies that could be laying around. I'll go out and get supplies.\" Hayami turned and felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned and it was Shizuka again as Miku fiddled with the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful okay.\" She gave him one of the most beautiful smiles he has seen, and for a stressful day, it gave him reassurance and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\" And he walked off, the hallway lights flickering as he walked out of the hallway and into the darkened street outside the hotel. He gave a deep breath of fresh air as he inspected the area. The moon gave him some light, and some of the light poles were still on. It was still and quiet. He remembered an old bible verse one of his teachers would drone on about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though I walk...\" He began walking on the street, bat on his shoulder. Taking in some of the ruined and sacked buildings and turned over cars. There was carnage here earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"through the valley of the shadow of death ,\" His thoughts trailed back to the girls. \"I will fear no evil, for you are with me.\" He saw a limbering figure groaning and approaching him from the darkness...A single one of 'them'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped his bat even tighter. \"your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\" He grabbed the metal club with both hands. \"You prepare a table before me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd swung, bashing in a female zombie's brains out in a one swing. \"in the presence of my enemies.\" He knelt down, as if feeling pity for the former human being. In the darkness he could make out the face of the monster, but it belonged to a pretty young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows,\" He closed the rolled over eyes of the dead zombie. And he continued his walk towards the market place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life,\" He remembered the kindness in his sensei's voice, and the lust within his fellow classmate's. He stared up at the moon. The down at the road. Seeing more of 'them' slowly crawling out. There was five of them, very few. He can handle this. He must survive. For his sake, and for theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Psalm 23. Verse 4 through 6.\" He ran, bat ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as he took his first swing at an elderly fat zombie, he still wondered how the heck did he remembered that entire verse.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hayami continued to walk, the dead zombies behind him as he spotted a sports utility store, some blood on his school uniform and his arms sore for swinging so hard. Maybe inside there could be weapons and other supplies? And maybe a more lighter bat that can do damage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked inside, he averted his eyes from some dead animals, mostly pets. He always had a soft spot for pets, especially his own dog Wedge. Which brought him back to a question that he has been dreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has become of his parents? His dad was working overseas in Korea, so he maybe okay, but his mother was at home in the suburbs and everything went by so fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit...\" he cursed. Now his own mother maybe dead, eaten, maybe turned into a fleshing eating fiend, or maybe still alive somehow. Either way, he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he had lives to care of, lives to look after. And maybe his own mother would berate him for coming after him, she being so self-sacrificing and what not. As he inspected the knives, he noticed some long knives and some hatchets. Maybe if he found a shopping cart he can gather all of these tools needed for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a grunt and someone open the door. He got to his knees, hid behind some shoes located nearby the knives, and grabbed both ends of his bat, his ears trying to pick up any noise. He heard some footsteps, more than one, but unlike 'them' who were disorganized and shuffled, this one was more organized, like a live human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, of all the places my parents had to send me too,\" growled the voice, which was female and quite irritated. \"Spend the weekend with your aunt because she deserves some love he said. Help her with anything she needs he said. A lot of good that did when she turned into some flesh eating cavader!\" He heard the footsteps walking towards the knife section and he slowly moved his footsteps. Could this be a scout for some motley crew with a dictatorship-like rule? But the voice was young, around his age. As Hayami hid behind the shoe shelf, he peeked through and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who assembled these tools? And how come no one picked them up?\" Pondered the girl. Hayami recognized her! She was wearing a ragged version of his own Fujimi High uniform, and there was a tear that asscentuated a long curvy leg. He saw that she had pink hair sported in two pink tails as she inspected the area where he once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakagi Saya, straight-A genius student and the daughter of Takagi Souichiro, one of the Ultranationlist Part head honchos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould he make himself known? What if the girl already belonged to a group? What if she was a scout for another group? But her earlier manner of speaking about an 'aunt' earlier implied otherwise. If memory served him correctly, she was absent at school. He accidentally leaned against the shoe shelf, causing one shoe to fall down. He ducked behind cover and he could hear her jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there!\" She yelped, he could hear her grab something. Probably the long edged hatchet. Hayami gave a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not here to hurt you.\" He stood up and walked out into view. True to his prediciton, she had the hatchet in a defensive stance, and he could see blood on her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you! Where did you come from and-is that our school uniform?\" Asked the pink haired girl as she noticed his tattered and bloodied uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuta Hayami, Grade 12, Fujimi High. Takagi Saya I presume?\" He walked up and offered his hand. Saya put down the axe and shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice Dr. Livingston reference. Yes that's me. What are you doing all the way out here near Kurayoshi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAN: google map Kurayoshi. It looks like a 12 hour drive from the Tokyo area, maybe less given how our heroes needed to run over zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to ask the same thing to you. And I've been driving from school and ran out of gas here. I had some people with me and we settled inside a hotel nearby. You?\" Saya looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father sent me out to live with my aunt for the weekend. She wanted to see me and she could use a hand with some chores.\" Hayami decided not to ask about what happened to her. It was obviously clear what had happened given the blood stains and her earlier remark about a 'cadaver'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even skipping class Friday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my class was going over an easy subject, nothing a little late night cram can't do for me to catch up,\" She looked melancholy. \"At least that's what I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Takagi-san,\" He remembered how she hated people to call her informally, despite her doing so. \"I am hunting for supplies and food for my two other companions back at the hotel. Our chances of survival can go up if you wish to join us, and so will yours.\" Saya began to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if I stay with you we could survive better as you said due to numbers. Very well I'll join you. Also, I know this area pretty well because I came here during the summer some times. I know the best out of the way locations as well as some markets that are clear of those monsters. I'll help you forage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Takagi-san, youre help is appreciated.\" Hayami grabbed a tent and began to make a makeshift sack and putting some of the knives and hatchets inside. Saya was collecting some baseball bats, some metal and wood. \"And why are you grabbing those bats for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh these? Don't you play on the baseball club as a Designated Hitter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do...how did you know?\" Saya turned away and Hayami grinned a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw some of my games did you.\" He slyly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one or two! Nothing big! Let's just find a market and use a shopping cart!\" She declared. Hayami shook his head and chuckled. He knew she was blushing. For such a smart and blunt girl she can get flustered rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course of course...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I theorized that 'them' react only to sound. Scent and sight are meaningless for them.\" Pointed out the pink haired girl, her tone serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hunch that they responded as such.\" Hayami opened the makeshift sack as Saya placed some the bats on the tent as he sprawled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not get poked. You know, they could be like sharks and smell fresh blood?\" The tools layed sprawled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. Now then, let's find that market and get some carts for this stuff and food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the newly added member of the crew headed out, Saya with a hatchet and Hayami with his metal bat, close by as they searched for a supermarket.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had only been a day and Hayami had amassed a group of three pretty, young woman to follow him through these rough times. Sure, he was keeping his mind primarily out of the gutter as to keep himself focused on surviving, but as a healthy young, teenage male, it was only natural he have the occasional fantasy about at least one the fine young women traveling along side him. In any case, he was at least glad that he could recruit Saya into the group, it would pain him to know that she had perished in these grim times. Of course, her just being with his group didn't guarantee survival, no, they would have to fight their way through this and hopefully make it out to the point where the initial apocalypse passes and the time for rebuilding begins...provided that time actually comes. Although, this did have Hayami wonder on one thing as he and Saya made their way to the Supermarket;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how long was this all going to last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, the initial doomsday event was still going strong and still needed time to kill the world dead (or at least try to), but just how long would that keep up? Hayami thought to himself a moment, and tried to pull together a possible theory as to how long the initial zombie apocalypse would last. \"<i>Okay, so the people infected become walking corpses, so obviously that means they're dead. And everyone knows that after a while a dead body decomposes...</i>\" Hayami was slowly piecing it together, coming up with a plausible cut off point to which the zombies might burn themselves out and finally succumb to rotting away and decomposing. If this much is true, they might not have to wait for too much longer before the zombies simply rot away and burn themselves out. Once that happens, rebuilding could finally start in earnest and things buff out from there (hopefully). Of course, this was a really big 'if' in terms of it being a truth to their undead menace. There wasn't anything saying that the zombies being produced were immune to decomposition. Even if they could be killed, them being immune to rot would only serve to slow the rate of rebuilding/repopulating the world and <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Hayami's thoughtful silence did earn him the attention of Saya, who found his lack of talking to be something she should look into, \"You're awfully quiet for someone who so easily persuaded me into your group.\" In her own way of course. Saya's words did well in snapping him out of his thoughts and toward the sharp eyed rich girl. \"Got your mind on something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you could say that.\" Hayami hummed, his mind still buzzing with questions as he let Saya in on what his current thoughts were. \"Mostly on how long the zombies will stick around, I know they're essentially walking corpses, so decomposition should probably kick in sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, things that die rot away over time. It's why I'm not worried about this whole thing at all.\" Saya remarked, a confident smirk on her face, one Hayami could only chuckle towards. Even during the end of the world, she held an air of . No doubt, she'll get fair with that strong will of hers. Of course, she had to be careful with that ego of hers, with it would come it's own share of problems if she let it get to her head. But, Hayami felt he needn't worry himself on that detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not trying to be the pessimist but, what if the zombies...don't rot.\" Hayami said, Saya's expression dropping a bit as she heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Saya quizzed the teenager, \"As in, the zombies would be immortal or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense, they can still be killed but just don't decompose.\" Hayami explained, looking forward to see the market place, it was a decently sized supermarket, one adeptly named, '<i>Kobachouyama Market</i>' already in sight, the parking lot practically vacant of any cars save for a few that still looked to have missed their chance to escape. \"Hold that thought...\" Hayami whispered, scanning the vacant asphalt plain and coming to note that there were at least 3 cars still in the lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still some cars around...\" Saya muttered, her analytical mind pulling together what could be lurking out here. \"We should be careful. If there are cars still here, then that means some people didn't make it in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami nodded, \"Yeah, but this could also mean that there are survivors here too...which could complicate things...\" In a sense anyway. Hayami held out faith that there were good people in the world but...with things going to hell as quickly as they were and resources most likely being the number one thing on people's minds, a group already staked out in the market might...not be willing to share their spoils. Hayami placed a hand on his stomach, a hungry growl rising from his middle, his own hungry belly reminding him of both Shizuka and Miku who were awaiting his return with food. By this point, he knew that he had no other choice, but to waltz on over and take what comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm, no need to worry about that. You have me on your side.\" Saya said, letting her confidence trickle out once more and reassure Hayami that the both of them could get past this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm counting on ya Takagi-san.\" Hayami nodded, as he and Saya trotted off to the market, ready to take whatever would pop up to face them...</span></div></div>",

Then proceeded to take out the remaining zombies (there were not that many in there to begin with there were only like six of them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all clear Takagi-san.\u201d Hayami stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but let\u2019s be quick about our trip no telling how long before more of them show up.\u201d Saya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two entered the supermarket clear to make their trip quick. They grabbed two shopping carts and stocked it all with they needed chips, drinks; granola bars anything they could get their hands on and left as fast as they came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are we going?\u201d Saya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hotel that\u2019s not too far from here.\u201d Hayami replied. \u201cThat\u2019s where they others are waiting, plus none of the zombies are in the hotel so it\u2019s safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be an eternal walk the two can finally see the hotel on the horizon when they heard a scream coming over from a tipped over limousine (its standing on its side) surrounded a by another small group of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back Takagi-san.\u201d Hayami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take long.\u201d Saya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily all of the zombies had their backs turned so they were easy targets. Then you turn your attention to the passenger door that just open and see yet another goddess of a woman. She was almost as tall as Shizuka-sensei about 174cm had short red hair, brown eyes and was wearing a fancy dress like she was going to a premier or something but luckily she was wearing regular shoes. Plus you could definitely hear a boing boing sound from her immense cleavage that outrivaled Saya\u2019s and Yuuki boobs and on par with Shizuka-sensei\u2019s boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy hero.\u201d The women said leaped towards you. \u201cThank you for saving me from those monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d You muffled through her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you that gravure idol that\u2019s one of the greatest models of Japan.\u201d Saya stated as she walk towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s me Izumi Morikawa at your service.\u201d She stated while doing a cute pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Haymai asked finally freeing himself from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I was on my way to a photo shoot when an explosion from a nearby gas station knocked over my limo and killed the driver.\u201d Izumi stated. \u201cI was okay but then I saw the monsters eating other people and they were about to do the same thing to me until you came along.\u201d \u201cSo where are you two going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just came from the supermarket with food supplies and heading back to a hotel that just down the road to meet up with the others.\u201d Hayami as he crawled back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan come to?\u201d Izumi asked. \u201cI know I don\u2019t look like much but I know I can be of assistance in some way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Saya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving picked up a new ally the trio continues their walk back to the hotel to meet up with Yuuki and Shizuka-sensei.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was somewhat fortunate that Saya had made the prediction that with the presence of cars at the market there were, by extension, zombies present in the area. While Hayami would have been alert for the appearance of anything bloody and groaning, his awareness was already peaked thanks to this insight and he was cautiously making his way to the entrance of the market, eyes darting across the scenery for anything suspicious that was set to crop up. The silence lingering in the nocturnal air was doing little to calm his already frantic nerves, the heart pumping in the center of his chest racing with a rising tide of adrenaline that lay set to be unleashed the moment a zombie set foot in front of him, or if Saya took note of it's presence. \"It's mighty quiet here now...\" He whispered, Saya walking behind him, looking back to her and taking note of how she bore no weapon for their venture into the market. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would quickly equal to bad news if she didn't have at least something to defend herself, even if it was just for right now. With that he paused and motioned for Saya to hand him the makeshift backpack they had made. A bit in the dark on what Hayami wanted with the backpack, Saya handed the weapon filled sack over to her fellow high school student, Hayami coming to rummage through it's cluttered contents and producing a small hatchet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, just in case.\" Hayami said to Saya, handing her the small axe like weapon. In truth, he was somewhat expecting her to put up a rouse on how she didn't need a weapon but, surprisingly enough, the pink haired schoolgirl did not have many words to say about Hayami's gesture save for a few...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright but we might not have to use any weapons.\" She replied, taking the hatchet in hand as Hayami gave her a perplexed look. \"Look up there, by the doors.\"  Doing as he was told, Hayami looked up and, just where Saya directed his attention, a small pile of corpses lay motionless and mutilated. Gunshot wounds dotted their discolored and rotting flesh which gave rise to only one possible conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Someone's here.\" Hayami muttered, rising up as his mind began to bring forth possible outcomes to this situation. In one hand, things could get complicated if the ones held up inside were stingy with their resources. This was the only market Hayami saw for miles so this place was, perhaps, his only option left in terms of grabbing anything food related. \"Well this could muck things up...\" Hayami added, continuing forward with caution, ready to take on whom ever greeted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya, on the other hand, wasn't as tense as her comrade as her less defensive stance and approach was enough to show. The bespectacled schoolgirl examined the scene before her, carefully making note of the lack of activity in front of them. \"Something's not right here...\" Saya spoke up, Hayami closing in on the market's glass doors and turning back to Saya for a second. \"Don't you think they would come out and meet us by now if there was anyone inside?\" Which was a good point, nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that maybe true but, it still doesn't subtract from the fact that we need to get in here?\" Hayami said, pushing open the glass gates to the market, the refreshing light source somewhat blinding his night adjusted eye sight as he stepped inside the chilled atmosphere of the market. Just as Saya implying, however, there didn't seem to be anyone of note inside. However, there was signs of a struggle, bodies of zombified market workers lay sprawled out in random locations in the market. No doubt that there was a fight here but...it didn't look like many of them survived... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like there was a fight here...\" Saya remarked, following Hayami inside. \"You think anyone survived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like it-\" However, as Hayami grabbed hold of a basket...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Is someone...there?\" A voice called out, it's tone sounding masculine and also...pained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doubt it, huh?\" Saya smirked teasingly at Hayami's mistake, the high school student remaining silent before he coughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's...always room for error.\" Indeed, but that aside, Hayami did manage to take note of the mystery person's voice, particularly of how he sounded as though he was in some form of pain or anguish. Gathering supplies would have to wait, it seems. \"Oi, who's out there? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-over here...by the...register.\" Hayami and Saya turned to one of the registers, the duo walking forth with caution and weapons in hand. Yes, the man sounded like he was in distress but, it always paid to be primed and ready to pounce (or run) at any given moment. Especially in these chaotic times...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami swallowed a lump forming in his throat as he slowly approached the register, his eyes slowly managing to catch glimpse of what was behind it; a man looking to be in his mid to late thirties lay at the foot of the counter, his attire seeming to reflect that he was an employee here. Blood was covered in the orange based work uniform he wore, his hands clutching a particularly bloody area on his left arm. His breathing was shallow and his skin was losing color by the minute. Hayami could see just by looking at his face that...he didn't have long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayami, over there.\" Saya spoke up, tugging at Hayami's shirt to get his attention. The senior looked up and jerked a little where he stood, a trail of blood lay splattered on the shining white floors of the market, this path of red plasma leading up to the zombified corpse of another market employee, female it seems, that had been turned into one of...Them. Looking back at the man and then at the zombie...it didn't take much for them to know what was going down...and what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the only one left here...?\" Hayami asked, wanting to make sure there were no other surprises here. The man nodded, before a ghastly cough followed his confirming gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ BGM - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ0V-lLrmDA\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ0V-lLrm...</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Listen...I...I don't have...much time...\" The man forced out, \"...I've seen it happen...to them...they get bitten...and they...they turn into those m-monsters...I...I-\" The man halted in his words, a bloodied coughing fit replacing whatever else could be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, hey easy we're...we're going to get you some help. Is there a first aid kit anywhere?\" Maybe, just maybe, there was a way to keep the infection at bay? Hayami wanted to remain optimistic on the matter, especially since he hasn't tried it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's going to work, Hayami.\" Saya said with a shake of her head, Hayami looking up to her to object only to be cut short by the man's fated words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-she's right...we've...tried to save others...didn't work...\" The man grimaces, an unexplainable agony twisting within him, forcing him to hack up a chunk of blood and give up just a little more time he had for the living. He had to hurry...he had to hurry and deliver this request. \"P-please...finish me. Kill me...before I turn. I don't...want to be come...like them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami hesitated, unsure on how he should act. He's...never killed anyone before. At least, not anyone who was still human. \"You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it...please!\" The man shouted, \"I have a wife...and a daughter...I don't...I don't want them to see me like this...not a monster...\" Hayami remained still, his nervousness beginning to effect his body as his heart raced and his hands shook. On one hand...he was putting someone out of their misery and saving them of becoming one of Them. On the other, he was killing someone to do it. Hayami eventually arose where he had crouched, his silence perplexing Saya more than a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayami...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weakened smile grazed the man's face, as he laid witness to his executioner readying himself to deliver him unto death...and free him from becoming one of the undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I do this, what's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shimazaki...Taro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami nodded, \"I'll tell your wife and daughter you died a brave man...\" Hayami gripped his bat in hand as tight as he could as he gazed down to the man below him. Steeling his nerves for what he was about to do, Hayami raised his bat and took aim on the man's head. \"Saya...don't look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya quickly averted her gaze as she heard Hayami's bat swing downward, dull thud ringing out several times before it all ended with a distinct <b>crunch</b>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the execution of one Shimazaki Taro, Hayami and Saya went about their business of filling the baskets with lots of foodstuffs and supplies to take back to the hotel. The duo spoke very little during the time, Hayami being especially shaken by the event and what he had to do. Yes...he did realize that it was nessaccary to save Taro's humanity but, killing him to do so...was something the high school student still needed to let settle with his mind. Eventually, the baskets in which each of them carried were filled with to the brim with supplies and out the duo went back into the night shaded wilderness that would lead them back to the one safe haven they knew. Hayami was unsure of how long he had taken but, now that he was on his way back and not worrying about the mission of forging, it gave him the chance to think about Shizuka and Miku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only hope the both of them were okay, but now that he and Saya were on their way there with food...he would find out soon enough whether they survived the time he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm on my way Shizuka...Miku...just hold on for a little while longer...</i></span></div></div>",

At least he died as a man rather than a monster!\u201d Hayami turned his head and revealed his glaring eyes as he shoved Saya into the side of a car with one hand, the slight collision making her \u201coomph\u201d and make her breasts bounce a little as well as shake up her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell was that for!?\u201d Hayami didn\u2019t reply, just continued to glare at the pinkette, who returned it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you could EVER understand\u2026\u201d He growled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see his life leave his eyes\u2026you didn\u2019t see how his head\u2026\u201d He bared his teeth, clenching his jaw. \u201cBecame almost like a dropped melon\u2026and it was by THESE hands!\u201d He removed his grip on her and placed his left hand near Saya\u2019s face. \u201cThese hands!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you have preferred killing him as one of those monsters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s easier and\u2026and\u2026\u201d Gone was the anger that was marring his visage, but replaced by sadness. \u201cI made a wife a widow\u2026and I\u2019ll make a little girl grow up with a father\u2026.\u201d He choked, and Saya\u2019s face softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami realized he dropped his basket of supplies, knelt down and placed them back into the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to head back tomorrow to get more supplies. More weapons, bottled water, and non perishable foods and-\u201c Both the two froze as they turned their heads to down the street\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was three of them\u2026one an old man, the other a middle aged woman, the other a teenage boy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami saw Taro\u2019s weak smile in his minds eye, and his face hardened. He placed the basket down and grabbed his bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay put Saya\u2026\u201d And he calmly walked towards the staggering zombies, as the pinkette could do nothing but stand by\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he yelled, releasing his pent up anger on the elder first, sending the zombie right onto the street with a saved in skull\u2026Then he did an overhead swing on the woman with grunt, and sent the woman into the face first\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step back, prepped his bat as if on first base as the teenage zombie staggered faster\u2026and with a swing akin to a baseball star literally sent convulsions throughout the zombie\u2019s head as it fell to the ground. Hayami calmly walked over to the backback he dropped before he engaged the zombies, with the face of stone, and grabbed a small pickaxe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya turned her head away as three loud distastefull sounds played out. She turned her back to him, and saw his shirt covered in more blood, and his eyes were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026I\u2019ll introduce you to the other two if they are not asleep\u2026\u201d He muttered. \u201cThe faster we get there\u2026the better our chances for not running into more of those insects\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya nodded quietly, not wanting to irk the boy\u2026no\u2026young man in front of her as he led on, her trotting right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a growl rang out and he snapped to attention, turning his head and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax\u2026\u201d said Saya, placing a hand on her stomach. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten in hours\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp yourself then,\u201d replied the boy, seeming to be more relaxed now. Saya reached into the basket and found<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwinkies? Pop tarts? Chips?\u201d she said in a distasteful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you expect house special thinly sliced beef with cabbage and lettuce?\u201d Replied Hayami in monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have at least found something with nutrition\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither ruined due to being warm, like the meat and milk and produce, or taken already,\u201d He turned his head back in front of him. \u201cJust deal with it.

He navigated through the debris and the darkened hallway, bat at the ready as Saya\u2019s cellphone made for a custom flashlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the room,\u201d he opened the door and craned his head in. He could hear the slight snoring of the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Thank heavens\u2026their alive\u2026\u2019 he thought. He went to the room across from the camp and opened the respective door(turns out it was already open) and walking inside and struggling with a mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya set down her basket and pack and went over to him. \u201cHere let me help\u2026\u201d The two quietly tip toed the queen sized mattress back into the room, making sure not to awaken Shizuka and Miku.

Shizuka didn\u2019t seemed to be as peeved as her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for bringing the magazine Miss Yuuki,\u201d said the blonde as she took a flashlight she found in the lobby desk and began to scroll over the titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d The Orangette rolled her eyes. She placed another hand to her stomach as it growled. \u201cBoring AND hungry!\u201d She complained, closing her eyes in slight distress. Another growl rang up and Shizuka placed her hands on her own slim stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, and Hayami-kun has been gone for a while and it\u2019s nearly midnight\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he turned to one of those monsters?\u201d Asked Miku, turning her head towards Shizuka in the dark. She can barely make out her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not! Hayami-kun isn\u2019t going to die to the hands of them,\u201d she said in defense in a somewhat clam tone. Miku seemed doubtful as she left the room, waving her hand to have the blonde nurse join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem optimistic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because Hayami-kun doesn\u2019t want us to suffer, so he\u2019ll stay alive to protect us,\u201d smiled Shizuka as she walked alongside the younger schoolgirl. Miku\u2019s eyes traveled to the buxom blonde, then returned to the dimly moonlit lobby, not replying back to Shizuka\u2019s answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026what are we doing out here?\u201d Asked Shizuka. Miku looked down the hall and grabbed a piece of debris and threw down there. Upon hearing no other sound other than the piece of ceiling fan clash on the ground she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinding a vending machine and a Fire extinguisher.\u201d Miku\u2019s hands went to her top and unbuttoned her blouse a little, revealing her generous cleavage and grabbed her cellphone from it. She opened it, turned it on, and used it a flashlight as she walked down the barren hall slowly, the blonde nurse right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like five minutes of constant walking and the occaisional tripping from the blonde nurse(and the with the \u2018Boing\u2019 sound from her big boobs) luck finally checked in as she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShizuka, if you would so kindly.\u201d Shizuka nodded and grabbed the red fire extinguisher with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, this is a bit heavy,\u201d she pointed out. Miku just rolled her eyes and kept on walking down the corridor slowly, and she noticed a light was still on in an open room. Closing her phone and putting back inside her cleavage, the orangette walked up and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was greeted to an ice machine and a vending machine. There was a slight puddle near the ice machine, but the Vending machine was untouched, rip for the taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound one, Sensei help out.\u201d She got near the wall close to the vending machine and Shizuka stood by her right, and both girls grabbed the fire extinguisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026this is totally stealing\u2026\u201d Said Shizuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh deal with it. On three, one\u2026two\u2026\u201d And the girls brought the extinguisher back and cracked hard against the vending machine, the glass being destroyed. Miku\u2019s first instinct was to grab a two-pack poptart and rip the plastic seal and dig right in, her stomach baying for nutrition. Shizuka did the same but with a small bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you get like, one of those laundry bins?\u201d Asked Shizuka as she ate through the chips. \u201cThat way we can bring all this food back with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking,\u201d Miku stood up, not before scarfing the last poptart down her throat and grabbing a big chocolate chip cookie and head down to the darkened corridor, using her cellphone to light the way. And Shizuka continued to snack\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Twenty Minutes later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku led the way as Shizuka pushed the stuffed laundry cart filled with vending goods back to the lobby. Both girls already ate their fill when they got the cart, seeking to replenish their energy. Miku was a bit worried after eating so much of the snacks, but it was the end of the world, so what if she eats nearly two thousand calories for one meal maid of on-the-go snacks. She needed food and didn\u2019t\u2019 eat since breakfast! Shizuka didn\u2019t seem to complain and the girl seemed to have eaten the most of the two, as the orangette noticed a slight bump in the nurse\u2019s white long-sleeved shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that was yummy!\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess. Let\u2019s head back to the room and get to sleep,\u201d Miku yawned. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka yawned as well. \u201cMe too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku pushed away from debris and furniture to make way for the cart, and the two found themselves back in their room in no time. Shizuka placed the cart nearby the TV and both girls got into their beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026let\u2019s leave the door unlocked for Hayami-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling ya\u2026it\u2019s a bad idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve in him Miku-san. I know,\u201d she gave another yawn as she stood up and walked over to Miku, who had her eyes quirked. \u201cHe\u2019ll\u2026come back to us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing in my bed\u2026\u201d She asked. As Shizuka laid down on the pillows, Miku could make out her smiling clam visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Miku-san you\u2019re so silly. Hayami-kun can\u2019t sleep with one of us, after all, he is a hormonal boy right~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku sighed and just plopped down on the covers, one of her hands going to her slightly stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t breath on me. I think we all may have a case of BO going on.\u201d Shizuka chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing Miku-chan,\u201d she shuffled under the covers and allowed sleep to take her. And Miku followed suit not long after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-X-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip for the two went by without incident, arriving at the hotel, according to Saya\u2019s watch, around 3:30.

The area was largely devoid of any life, the morning light allowing one to see the few shambling corpses trudging along the remote streets with no aim or goal save to consume what living flesh they could. Thankfully, there didn't seem to be any undead disturbances present near the hotel, the slumbering group of young women safe from the infectious jaws of Them. In any case, Saya was the first to arouse from her slumber, the pink haired teen's eyes lazily fluttering open as the spread curtains allowed some much needed sunlight to wash into the room and jar the sleep from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...first time I slept in my school clothes...\" Saya grunted, noting on how she didn't exactly feel one hundred percent about having slept in her day time attire. Knowing that falling back asleep was pointless (in many ways), Saya pushed herself upright and took in her surroundings, her sharp gaze gliding over to the still snoozing Miku and Shizuka in the same bed. Shizuka slept with her body splayed about, the covers, proving that the nurse slept wild. Saya did note of the short skirt, the snug garment hugging tightly around the nurse's rounded hips. However, Saya took a minute to examine Shizuka's partially covered body and discovering that her middle had a plump protrusion rising up, though not enough to draw too much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya simply shrugged and pulled herself up, making her way over to the door to go and check up on their one and only guard in this vacant hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before her hand could even reach the door's knob, it flung itself open as the visage of Hayami entered the room. Having been up for most of the night with no sleep was very evident on his face, his sleepless eyes drooping and barely able to keep themselves open, yet still managing to remain aware of what was in front of him. At least, to a small degree. \"...Mornin'.\" Hayami uttered in a lethargic tone, Saya merely looking to the sleep depraved teenage before the sound of sheets shifting garned both their attentions over to Miku's area of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired teen rose up from the covers with a loud yawn, eyes fixating to Hayami the moment they were adjusted to the light of the room. \"Mornin', Hayami-kun...~\" Miku greeted to the tired teeanage in a rather sensual tone, pushing the covers off her lower body just enough for Hayami to catch a glimpse of her underwear. Though, while Miku was trying to appear seductive to Hayami, there was an addition to her body she seemed ignorant about. Most notably being the soft layer of excess pudge that clung to her belly and thighs, her thick lower region beginning to push against her thin laced underwear with it's increased mass and size. \"You look pretty tried, why don't you lay down and rest~?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya rolled her eyes as Hayami's blank and sunken gaze fixated on Miku's swaying bosom about to lure him close. Hayami was unsure if Miku was even wearing a bra or not, but from what he could tell, she was completely bare underneath. However, this soon took a back seat to something more important... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep rumble rolled from Shizuka's paunch, the slightly pooched out swell voicing it's displeasure of being empty as it snarled with a renewed hunger to feast. Shizuka squirmed in her fading ability to sleep, her empty tummy making it more than a little different to relax and return to dreamland. Sadly, it was clear that Shizuka wasn't going back to sleep and, with this in mind, woke up to push herself upright. \"Hmm...I'm kinda hungry...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose now is as good a time as any for some breakfast.\" Saya agreed with the hungry nurse, turning back to where she had placed all of their food rations and walking to go fetch them. As Saya wondered just what she would be enjoying for breakfast, her eyes soon fixated on a basket loaded down with snacks...especially those of the Pop-tart variety. Saya frowned in disappointment, having forgotten that a lot of the foods they salvaged from the grocery store were mostly sweets that lacked any form of nutritional value to them. \"Hope you guys like Pop-tarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Was that really all you could bring back?\" Miku inquired not exactly finding pop tarts as ideal breakfast material...at least, not now anyway. \"If that's the case we might as well live off the vending machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either that or eating spoiled food. Deal with it.\" Hayami snarled back, his lack of a decent night's rest making him more than a little irritable at the moment. His snide remark wasn't entirely caught by him until he realized he could literally -feel- Miku glaring at him with those sharp feminine eyes of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right though, you really have no place to complain ya'know.\" Saya agreed to Hayami, getting her share of toaster pasteries and some cinnamon sugared ceral and an assortment of cookies. Saya couldn't say she liked Miku that much, most of this due to her attitude. She's known the orange haired minx from school and couldn't honestly find her to be a likable person. \"Ugh, I hope I don't get a stomach ache from all these sweets...\" Even so, she couldn't entirely deny the poor choice in foodstuffs either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka however didn't find any room to argue or complain about the selection they were given, the buxom nurse rising from the bed with a cheerful spring in her step and grabbing as much food as she could. In her eyes, food was food, no matter how sweet it was and, when you're hungry it's best not to hesitate when being presented with a free meal. \"Mmm, so many yummy foods...~\" Shizuka hummed cheerfully, her plump, heart shaped rump in the air as she lay bent over to forge for what she wanted to consume. The skirt she had borrowed from Miku was beginning to strain in resistance, the low cut pelted dress exposing a little peek at the curvaceous nurse's black underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Hayami wasn't aware of this would be an understatement of the largest degree, the teen's eyes fixated on Shizuka's round bottom as it swayed about to the tune of her melodious humming. Was her ass always this big and squeezable?  watching as Shizuka fumbled upright and tried to carry a horde of different snacks and foods back to the bed where she would pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this wasn't saying that he went unnoticed in his ogling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, aren't you slick.\" Miku began, giving Hayami a look he couldn't quite gauge. \"Staring at Shizuka-sensei's ass...naughty, naughty Hayami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't staring, I was...thinking really hard.\" Hayami lied, trying to cover for what his horomones told him to do earlier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's staring at what?\" Shizuka chimed in, after swallowing a mouthful of double stuffed sandwich cookies and now beginning to work on a bag potato chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm, Hayami-kun was eyeing up your butt, Shizuka-sensei~\" Miku chuckled, now having a little fun with teasing the flustered teen...though it was clear the fun being had here was one-sided, at best. Shizuka blinked for a moment before looking to Hayami, his cheeks reddening as soon as she caught eye contact with him. Miku only saw further to tease him once she saw this. \"Hehe, lookit him. I bet he's just dying to get a handful of your butt, sensai~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, screw this...\" Hayami huffed under his breath and turned on his heels towards the door. Saya perking up from her meal to see that Hayami was on his way back out with no food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out.\" grunted Hayami before he passed the threshold of the room and shut the door behind him, leaving the three girls to eat and converse amongst themselves. Though, for a good minute or two, no one seemed to say anything until Saya saw it was fit to call out the one person who was the cause of the scenario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you? Can't you see the guy had a rough night?\" Saya chided to Miku, the orange haired girl giving Saya a frown back in response but, generally seeming unconcerned with her disapproval on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was only having some fun with him. He was the one that got all huffy about it.\" Miku replied, her answer not entirely boding well with Saya's already tarnished view of her character. However, while Miku and Saya stared each other done, the tension between them building by the second, Shizuka silently continued to eat, wondering on something she felt that had to be done...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm going to go talk to Hayami-kun...\" Shizuka finally decided, as she arose from the bed, taking with her some snacks for both her to munch on as well as Hayami. The remaining two girls didn't wish the nurse luck as she clumsily reopened the door and headed down the beaten hallway to find Hayami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shizuka wandered the hall in search of Hayami, she was treated to an unwanted reminder that the world she once knew had came to an end. The chaotic mess in the hall, blood splattered onto the once luxurious walls and the clear signs of a massive struggle did well to rekindle the fact that even though they were alive...there were still the threat of Them roaming the outside world. In truth, Shizuka had almost forgotten but, the moment she stepped out into the outside, her memory was more than a little refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope Rika-san's okay...\" Shizuka thought, her mind wandering back to her best friend and room mate who had left her before the incident that started the outbreak of the undead. Shizuka knew Rika was a strong woman but, it didn't stop her from being worried about her. Perhaps, they will meet again sometime? That's what Shizuka hoped for anyway. Only then would her mind be put at peace of what worry she held about her closest friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her memory of Rika was interrupted as Shizuka rounded the corner leading into the lobby and spotted Hayami sitting on the reception desk. The irritated teenager was silent, eyes cast to the floor as he fiddled with the only weapon he currently had and used in the protection of both himself and the three girls who followed him. Shizuka stood by for a moment, before finally approaching the silent teenage, the ruffling of her many bags fo snacks rousing Hayami from his deep thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I just decided to check up on you to see if you were okay.\" Shizuka noted, hoisting herself onto the desk, the wood beneath her chubby bottom creaking in protest to Shizuka's added weight. The nurse wasn't entirely aware of this. \"Listen...I hope you won't be mad at Miku...she was only having a little fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the expense of me.\" Hayami muttered, his irritable nature making it difficult to simply let it slide as easily as Shizuka wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't mind.\" Shizuka offered, Hayami gazing back up to her. \"I get stared at a lot...it's something I'm used to.\" The nurse added with a friendly smile, Hayami hesitating in answering her for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...don't think I'm some pervert or whatever?\" Hayami asked, knowing this is the first thing that girls thought of a guy if they caught him staring at any part of her body. Shizuka answering his question with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. You're at that age when your hormones do more of the talking than your brain does. It's perfectly natural to be enamored by the body of a mature young woman.\" The nurse giggled, placing her hand on Hayami's shoulder. \"Just remember, looking is better than touching in some cases~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, yeah...I suppose you have a point.\" Hayami chuckled, as he and Shizuka fell into silence, the teenager finding himself admiring her enormous breasts and the rest of her thickening body. Being this close to the nurse, Hayami was able to take in the aroma of Shizuka's feminine scent, the sweet and perfume like smell further relaxing him and doing well to relieving his body of the tensions that gripped his tired body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry if I was being snappy at you guys back there.\" Hayami apologized, Shizuka looking down to him as she continued to work on her 'breakfast' she had placed at her side. \"I guess the all-nighter sorta got to me in it's own way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Hayami-kun,\" Shizuka replied, finding it easy to forgive him. After all, she had found it nice that he had offered to do such a thing in the first place. Not many would stand up to protect them in the way Hayami has done. That said, Shizuka made sure to give the teenager a good hug to show her appreciation for all that he's done since yesterday. \"You've done a lot since we spent the night here...you have our thanks for being our little knight in shining armor~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami was a bit taken aback by the hug but, certainly didn't find room to complain. Mostly from being pressed up against the nurse's sizable bosom, the jiggly mounds of fat squishing against his body and forcing his brain to react in the only way it knew how when presented with breasts; send all the blood down south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh god...</i>\" Hayami cursed, his male horomones being the bane of him once more. Hayami gulped down a lump in his throat as he gently tried to weasel his way out of Shizuka's embrace, not exactly wanting his coming erection to even make itself known to her. Yes, the hug felt all manners of great, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, this didn't mean that Hayami's squirms went unnoticed, the nurse casting a curious glance to Hayami as she tilted her head. \"Is something wrong?\" She asked, finding his fidgety movements to be odd for accepting a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami stammered, face flushing deep crimson as he tried to force out a good excuse that didn't involve him having wood. \"U-uhh, well you see...\" It was a shame there were none at the current time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka seemed to take this lack of coherent sentences in a way Hayami feared and gave him a frown. The nurse released her hold on him and took on a forlorn expression, \"It's because you think I'm ugly don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami's mind did a complete 180, the teenager's mind unable to process the subject \"Shizuka\" and the word \"ugly\" in the same sentence. \"Bwha!?\" Was all he could manage, both confused on why Shizuka felt this way and flabbergasted she would even think that he would see her as 'ugly'. \"Shizuka-sensei? W-why would you...?\" He needed to know the origin of these feelings. Just where the hell was this coming from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the boys I hug or hang out with always get all flustered and distant from me. So, I thought they were thinking that...I was ugly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything she was a bit air-headed, but ugly was not a factor in this equation. \"Uhh...no, you're not ugly, Shizuka-sensai. At least...not to me, anyway.\" Hayami said, wanting to set a few things straight with the oblivious nurse and make clear to her just why guys felt the way they did around her. Granted, it wouldn't be an easy task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...don't think I'm ugly?\" Shizuka blinked, a small pink blush racing across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not.\" Hayami answered with a shake of his head. \"You see...well, guys get that way around you because...well, you're pretty. I mean <b><i>really</i></b> pretty.\" Hayami added, rubbing the back of his head, feeling his face heat up and his heart speed up in it's rhythm. \"You know what happens when a guy gets aroused...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka nodded silently. The both of them remained wordless before the truth finally sank in, Shizuka perking up with her surprised expression reflecting her assisted epiphanay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Shizuka gasped, looking to Hayami who coughed and tried to cover his tightening pants. \"So...you mean that...you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuh-huh...\" Hayami nodded, blushing. The teenager was glad he didn't have to explain this in depth like he thought. He may have known a lot from Sex-ed but, he wasn't exactly feeling confident in explaining it to someone who was older than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I'm so silly.\" Shizuka giggled, her cheeks red from embarrassment as she nudged Hayami in the shoulder. \"All this time...I thought guys were avoiding me just because I was ugly when...it was the opposite!\" However, it was then that Shizuka was able to remember that someone did manage to speak out about her attractive appearance just now. The nurse turned and looked to Hayami who was doing his best to will his erection away. \"So, you...really think I'm pretty, Hayami-kun...~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, you're the prettiest school nurse I've ever seen.\" Hayami said truthfully, his words causing Shizuka's heart to flutter. Before she knew it, she was giving him yet another hug, once before to show her appreciation...and now to give him thanks. Her arms hugged his head right into her bosom as she squeezed him as tight as she could before finally relenting and giving him a look in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Hayami...\" She said to him with a warming smile, the teenager blushing and returning the hug with his own. By this point, his brain was telling him to simply go along with things and see what happens. Things were going well so far, after all.</span></div></div>",

The teen broke the hug a little and blushed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have no running water or plumping. There's nothing we can do about it...\" He said looking to the side and to the outside of the hotel. Shizuka followed his gaze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd saw over half a dozen corpses of 'Them' on the ground, dead for good. The blonde nurse looked down at the teen, then at the blood stained bat to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you stood up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let any of you die...\" Said Hayami ruefully. \"Not on my watch. The thought of you or Takagi or Yuuki becoming one of them I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off by the feeling of wetness on his forehead, and with a face full of a near bursting white shirt, he realized what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami was getting a forehead kiss from Marikawa Shizuka, the hottest woman in perhaps all existence. The golden eyed woman broke the kiss and smiled at the dark haired teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for saving me,\" She clasped her hands. \"My hero~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's nothing...\" He then cut off by the rumbling of both his and her stomachs, their hunger demanding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" he looked back up at her. \"Should head back to the room? I could use some breakfast. Haven't eaten since 2 A.M.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you tell the time?\" Asked Shizuka. Hayami pointed his hand across the hall, and above the entrance was a clock, still ticking. It read 7:23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" And the two stood up and walked back to the room, though as Hayami walked behind Shizuka, bat in hand, his eyes traveled downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her sashaying rump and plump juicy legs, the skirt barely containing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me that when we hit the road, we may have to risk going into a mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Asked the cute yet sexy nurse, her breasts jiggling in tandem, and the *BOING*ing noise audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes. For all of us. If any haven't been stolen yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka nodded. \"True...\" She turned back around and the two eventually reached the room, seeing Miku and Saya sitting on a couch. Saya had something in her hand as she munched a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" He asked as he saw her using her cellphone as a light for some book. The pinkette looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at a map. So far,\" she sighed as she closed the magazine. \"It's not a town map. Just one of the nation, and we all know where we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are we?\" Asked Shizuka, finger to her lips. Saya just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saijo, in the Ehime Prefecture.\" She said. Hayami nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I recalled driving over some bridges on the way here. Also saw a few signs as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Miku, speaking up as she ate at some Lays potato chips. \"Where do we go from here?\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully they didn't notice as they got out to the lobby and looked up into the bright blue sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, the trail of a jet was there, heading north.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Shizuka's hunger was more a sign to a budding seed of gluttony, Hayami's was more a natural onset of having stayed up all night with very little to keep his body's function in balance. One could easily say that his snappy attitude was due to him being cranky from not eating but, it was only obvious at this point. Whatever the case may be, the fact still remained that both Shizuka and Hayami were hungry for some breakfast and were going to need something to eat if they wanted to be at 100%. However, there remained one problem with this, where would they find breakfast? Well, the answer to this was obvious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...since we're short of all our food now, we'll need to find more somewhere down the road.\" Hayami suggested to everyone as they all made their way back into the hotel. The teenager didn't mean to sound miffed about this situation but, he did kinda wished that Saya and Miku had a bit more self control and didn't eat everything in one go. They'd still need to leave for groceries but, they'd at least be full when they did it. \"Still couldn't you have saved us at least a bag of chips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya turned away, a shade of pink tinging her cheeks as the haughty teen realized just how much she had scarfed down. It felt a little embarrassing to have such a swollen belly and one that was partially exposed at that. \"W-well, we couldn't help that we were hungrier than we realized.\" Saya huffed, feeling the mass of snacks churning and roiling in her bloated and packed middle. It felt a little gross to actually feel her stomach sloshing so much food about within her but, it was a mechanism that couldn't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, all that stuff you got was nothing but empty calories anyway.\" Miku shrugged, hand subconsciously rubbing on her puffed up belly, a hand jetting to her mouth as she went to intercept and stifle what would have been a rolling belch. \"Urf...it's no wonder funbags is still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami simply shook his head, knowing that the reason for so many 'empty calories' was due to circumstances he couldn't readily fix or control. \"Well, it's like I said before, the stuff we had were things that weren't spoiled, so unless you wanted real bad stomach problems, then we had to make due with snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blugh...feels like I'm having a stomach problem right now...\" Saya complained, palms cupping underneath her heavy, bloated gut as it resounded with a churning gurgle. The sugary and gooey remains of dozens of pop-tarts bubbling inside the overfed dome as Saya's cheeks puffed up from a withheld burp that rose from the active gut below. \"Sheesh, too many pop-tarts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself...\" Shizuka moaned, her softened belly burbling with need as it called for food yet again. The top heavy nurse was quick to notice that her hunger was not the only problem to deal with, her dainty hands wiping at her forehead that was beginning to accumulate sweat. \"Mhn...not to mention it's getting hooot too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, the humidity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it...it is getting a bit muggy.\" Hayami said, fanning at at his neck as he gazed skyward and noticed the position of the sun. He couldn't tell what time it was exactly but, mid-day had to be close by, if not, already here. \"We'll need to grab some more duds too. Maybe some that can match this hot weather.\" Hayami had entirely forgotten that this heat was thanks to them being in the middle of June. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope we find something thin and loose...hm, like a sundress?\" Shizuka added wearily, the blonde sighing as she reached up to her blouse and began to undo the pressured buttons that held back her enormous, jiggling bosom. Hayami turned to Shizuka ready to respond to her only to find his words thoroughly shoved back down his throat as he watched the sweaty mounds of Shizuka's impressive cleavage bounce forth, \"Plus I don't think my skirt can hold up much longer...\" Shizuka's widening hips were pushing the pelted skirt to it's limit, what was tight fighting at first now close to snapping at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...<i>your</i> skirt?\" Miku echoed, giving the nurse a dirty look as she seemed to forget just who had lent her the bottom piece. \"I hope we do find some clothes, if we don't, thunder ass over here is going to snap my skirt right at the seams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill, Miku. Once we find a mall or something, I can bet you'll find a replacement for your old clothes. Everyone will, I'm sure.\" Hayami reasoned, Miku huffing as she turned back to the hotel. The teenager had almost forgotten she's spent this entire time in her underwear...Hayami fixating his eyes on Miku's panty clad lower regions. It was...well, a lot juicier than normal, her ass seeming to have plumped up a bit and was slowly starting to swallow up her underwear. It took a bap on the back of the head from Saya to get Hayami's focus back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyway, we should focus on getting some breakfast, so we'll have to bear with being in this area a bit longer.\" Hayami announced, rubbing the back of his head as his gaze fixated on the car they drove here in. That's right, having this up and running would make travel both easier and safer...to a degree. However, \"If we can find a gas station, we'll be able to refuel our little car there and drive our way to the mall and even further north to the Oki Islands. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good wi-urpf--me.\" Saya replied, stifling a burp. Miku and Shizuka silently agreed to Saya's words, making the decision unanimous. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the plan currently set, the group made their way to the one other location in which they could have at least a decent breakfast for the morning. The surrounding area near and around the hotel was remarkably peaceful, but this was something Hayami and co. didn't complain about. However, the curiosity of the sparse number of Them did still remain as Shizuka perked up with a question regarding the manner. The answer was simple, as Saya had stated. The near remote location seemed to be one of the contributing factors of the lack of undead to deal with, any that were on their way here probably won't arrive until they're long gone, so while there was no worry of Them knocking at their door at the moment, they would certainly become a probem much later. Fortunately, Hayami and Saya were confident that if everything went according to plan, they wouldn't need to meeting those approaching zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this all needed to go off without a hitch and, so far, things were only just beginning for the small group of foragers as they made their way to the market located close to the hotel. Saya had theorized that there would still be some nonperishables left in the market for them to scavange off of for breakfast. Though, as far as Shizuka and Hayami was concerned, just anything to help fill their stomachs was more than enough for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're here...\" Hayami alerted to the girls, a distant and unsavory recollection flashing in his mind that caused him to shudder. Saya seemed to pick up on his involuntary reaction to the memory he had surrounding this place, the pinkette blinking for a moment as she placed a hand on his shoulder. \"...Right, let's eat, don't wanna stick around here too long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally~!\" Shizuka chirped, hands pressed on her paunchy middle, the thick nurse making a swift approach to the store with the others slowly following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, she's like a kid in a candy store.\" Miku pointed out with a flat gaze, her own stomach still quite swollen and full. The stuffed organ was still hard at work on digesting th so called \"empty calories\" she critized earlier on, something that appeared to take much longer than she'd liked. Miku turned around to caution a gaze towards her rump, her panties riding up as her much larger and soft bum seemed intent on eating the seat of her dainty undergarments. Miku spoke nothing on this and merely tugged the soon to be wedgie out of her squishy rear and followed suit with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe market was in the same condition as Hayami and Saya had left it, the only real difference being Shizuka who was nothing short of a tornado of snack gathering. Nothing appeared to have been looted overnight so, it was safe to assume that they wouldn't be needing to worry about any thieves or other kinds of depraved cut-throats hanging out here. Hayami turned his gaze to where he found Taro the other night, his words and dying wish still replaying in his mind like a busted record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Saya's voice alerted Hayami to the bloated teen standing in front of him. \"Don't get so hung up on it. It's not you're fault, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami opened his mouth to question just how Saya knew what he was being so distant about but, found that such an inquiry would have been moot. She was quite sharp as far as he's seen so, it was only natural that she could key into his mannerisms. \"...I know. It's just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just focus on getting something to eat, okay?\" Saya spoke up, her stomach letting out a roiling gurgle that evoked a considerable blush on her face. \"...Ugh, I don't think I should eat anything else here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then grab a basket and stock up. You may not be hungry now, but you may be later.\" Hayami advised, a slight chuckle in his voice as he looked up to see that Miku had already left their side and was...well, she was with Shizuka helping herself to more snacks. Hayami couldn't help but blink in a sense of confusion since he knew that Miku was just as full as Saya and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, she keeps eating like that and those panties are going to be a thong soon.\" Saya smirked, with a haughty giggle. \"Anyways, I'll handle the food, Hayami-kun. Go enjoy yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrusting that Saya would handle things as far as restocking supplies, Hayami headed down into the aisle in which Shizuka and Miku were located, the top heavy nurse having assembled quite a pile of snacks for herself and was gorging happily on cinnamon buns and Pringles. Hayami gazed down to see she had already demolished a good pile of sweets already prior to him arriving, something that was no doubt the cause of the puffed up mound on the blonde nurse's middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-!\" Shizuka perked up, her line of sight and pause in eating getting Miku to turn around and spy Hayami close by. \"Haah, hello, Hayami~\" The nurse greeted, taking only those few words before she went right back to stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's going to be a while.\" Miku spoke up, slurping on a juice box as she worked on a large box of cheddar snacks. \"So, where's Saya? She a little too high and mighty to join us?\" Hayami had almost forgotten how condensing Miku could be when she wanted to, the teen sighing and making a cautious grab for a bag of chips in the pile of edible sacrifices near Shizuka. Hayami was legitimately afraid that if Shizuka caught him stealing from her pile, he'd be in deep, deep shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya's taking care of restocking on supplies before we head out again.\" Hayami felt compelled to call Miku out on why she wasn't helping but, decided against it for now. He'd just consider it as \"strike 1 out of 3\" before he did so. \"You didn't get enough back at the hotel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...w-well, I can't really explain it but, watching fatso over here pig out sorta pulled me into it too.\" Miku huffed, stuffing a handful of cheezy snacks into her gullet. \"Ya hear that? You're a bad influence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka didn't bother replying, the nurse merely looking up from pouring candies down her mouth, her cheeks swollen with the sugary goodness. It took no more than a few seconds before she was right back to glutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm trying not to eat so much anyway. I have to watch this figure of mine.\" Miku sighed, Hayami taking her silence there after as a reason to focus on eating his own shares. This, however, wasn't entirely the case as the teen soon found Miku's hefty buns parked on his lap, the short haired minx giving him a seductive glance over her shoulder. \"Or do you like this big ol' butt I'm growing back there~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Hayami coughed, trying his best not to choke on a chip. That was something else about Miku he'd forgotten. \"No comment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No comment?\" Miku raised an eyebrow, shuffling her hefty bottom directly on Hayami's crotch. \"Oh, I think you have more to say than that...~\" Miku was positive that he did, there was no self-respecting teenager that didn't want a piece of her lush behind and Hayami was no exception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami swallowed down a lump in his throat, Miku's advances doing quite well to rouse apart of him that he had hoped to suppress for much of their journey. Unfortunately, at this age, Hayami had very little control over his own urges and if they wanted his body to show he was aroused then there was little he could do to stop it. \"No seriously, Miku...\" He tried to protest, the bottom heavy Miku on his crotch simply giving him what he could only guess were bedroom eyes. Oh boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Hayami...\" Miku began, shifting herself about so that she was facing him, her thick legs wrapping around his waist as her face inched closer to his own. \"I never had a chance to thank you for saving me back at school. Why don't we go into the Break Room back there and...let me repay you...~\" Her voice was soft as silk, her natural aroma beginning to overwhelm him like nothing short of a pheromone. Her ample breasts pushed against his chest as she embraced him, the promiscuous girl moaning softly in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami hesitated, conflicted on if he should even reciprocate. Though his body was already wanting him to answer Miku's calling and take her right into that break room where he was sure they wouldn't come out for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BUUURRRAAAP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexually charged teenagers stiffened their mood shattered by a gaseous eruption that radiated from no one else but Shizuka. The duo turned gazes toward the blonde nurse to find that she had effectively slaughtered quite a hefty supply of snacks and at least two boss sodas in her gluttonous rampage. As a result, Shizuka's gut had swelled tremendously, bursting out from her already taut shirt and presenting a boulder of gurgling and sloshing flesh that gave the nurse a look of being full term with a hefty pregnancy. Hayami could spy a bit the underside of her massive bosom due to how much her belly had opened her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooouff...'scuse me...~\" The nurse giggled lazily, rubbing on her bloated middle and relaxing back to enjoy being full at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku gave the lazy blond a scowl, partly frustrated with her because of the mood she had broken with her lapse in manners. \"Ugh, what a fatass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're not much different, right?\" Same the voice of Saya as she rolled the shopping cart close by, eyeing the two interlocked teens with a somewhat dirty look. Hayami couldn't help but feel as though Saya was giving him an even dirtier look than Miku...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the girl who looks like she got knocked up.\" Miku shot back with a huff, laying her head on Hayami's chest. Saya's face burned bright pink, her lips pursing and her frown intensifying from the building hostility she held toward Miku. \"What do you want anyway...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miku, cut it out.\" Hayami scolded, the bottomless teen clicking her teeth and sliding her self from off him and focusing on her cheddar snacks. Looks like he won't be getting any for today, something his libido was screaming in defeat over. Hayami sighed, turning back to Saya to address her. He didn't exactly like the incriminating look she was giving him but, he decided best not to pay much attetion to it now. \"Anyways...what's on your mind, Saya?\"</span></div></div>",

We drove for hours, only stopping to get water and bathroom breaks,\" answered the teen. \"So the gas station may still have gas pumping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and the power MIGHT just be on,\" Saya nodded. \"We saw some spots in town having the power on, like the light-posts. Maybe the gas station may have some power left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it doesn't?\" Drawled Miku cynically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it does not we're up shit creek without a paddle aren't we?\" Snipped back Saya, glaring at Miku. \"We would either have to travel on foot, which is dangerous, or find another means of transport if we need to get to Sakaiminato for a boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're close to Saijo, but because that is a populous city going to there on foot is disastrous, and plus there is the heat. We would suffer from heat stroke,\" added Shizuka as she rubbed her stuffed middle with one hand. The other ripping off a pocky box lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we need to gamble on the gas station. Then refill the car and head to the high way and head north. Saya, still got that map?\" Asked Hayami. The twin-tailed genius nodded. and brought it out. The girls and guy huddled around, Miku and Shizuka still munching on their treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, here we are in the outskirts of Saijo, in Ichikura.\" He pointed at the spot on the map where Saijo was. \"For us to get to Sakaiminato we need to head north to the city and we have two choices: head east or west.\" His finger guided over the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got east we backtrack on how we got here, going through Niihama, Marugame, over the Seto Ohashi Line Bridge and through some islands. We then go through Kurashiki and Okayama and head north. Simple yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem,\" Saya spoke out. \"Those are some populous areas. Which means more of Them. Plus freeways could be blocked due to cars and debris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was getting to that,\" Hayami said, his finger moving from east to west. \"If we go west we head to Imabari and over the Nishi-Seto Bridge, then we island hop. I think this would take more time, but it would have less people, so fewer number of Them to encounter. Then we would merge onto the Shimanami Kaido highway and hit Onomichi. We then head east for a bit and hit Kurashiki and head north or stick to the mountain high ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back up to the girls, Shizuka and Miku\u2019s belly\u2019s more fuller by the time he finished his explanation. \u201cDid you catch that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically,\u201d Miku shrugged. \u201cWe got east and it\u2019s the fastest, but more danger. Go west and it\u2019s the scenic slow route, but less chance.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if a bridge is destroyed?\u201d Asked Shizuka. \u201cOr if it\u2019s blocked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Seto-Nishi Highway is enormous. It has two large pedestrian and bike lanes. Plus if possible we could find cars in any of the island towns to commandeer, borrow, that sort of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyou mean steal,\u201d Saya rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world and we are \u2018technically\u2019 stealing food. I suppose stealing a car to get us from Point A to Point B won\u2019t be a problem unless it\u2019s owners are alive or they are willing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we go west,\u201d Shizuka said tossing the empty pocky box to the side. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go island hopping on the Seto-Nishi express way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that could work,\u201d Miku agreed. \u201cPlus we won\u2019t run into much of Them as you say Hayami-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWest it is.\u201d Hayami handed the map back to Saya. \u201cSo, get the supplies?\u201d He asked, seeing her grocery cart filled with bandages, anti-bacterial wipes, batteries, flashlights, and some water bottle cases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh, yeah?\u201d Saya quirked an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go grab some clothes. Saya, know where the nearest mall is?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll lead the way. We need both new clothes, underwear, and socks.\u201d Hayami laughed a bit as he opened a bag of Doritos. Finally some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can never have too many socks.\u201d  He turned back towards the two girls and urged them to get up. \u201cOkay, girls. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay~,\u201d cooed Shizuka as she stood up and wobbled a bit, hand on her middle. \u201cOooom, I think I\u2019m full for now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble for me,\u201d groaned Miku as she stifled a belch with her hand. Looking down she looked distressed. \u201cMy figure\u2019s ruined~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody cares.\u201d Yelled out Saya as they left the grocery store and back into the humidity.

It's pure misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoooooot,\" whined Shizuka as she was out in the sun in her underwear walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geee, thanks for pointing out the obvious,\" groaned Miku as she wiped her brow. \"Are we there yet Takagi!\" She asked as she took another gulp of water to be hydrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just two blocks away!\" Saya said as she looked back at the panting Hayami and girls. Even the genius was huffing a bit. Man she has been out of shape! Placing a hand on her dome, she rubbed as they progressed forward and the sole male noticed a large tree with shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, let's stop here.\" He said, stopping the group. \"We got sunblock right Saya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya nodded and showed him a bottle of sunscreen. \"Smart Hayami-kun. I can't believe I forgot about that.\" She pushed the cart towards and Hayami's eyes diverted once again to her bottom. Walking behind her has been...delightful as he saw that Saya had quite the booty for a girl her age. But the weather has been such a pain in the ass he didn't even care about it in spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group got off the side walk and under tree, more cars parked and some debris in the area, showing that this town was populous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s sunscreen up and get moving.\u201d Hayami said as he took the sunblock and began to lather his arms with the white substance. He then began to lather the back of his neck and his face, closing his eyes. He felt a pair of delicate silky hands rub his arms and he opened his eyes in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Shizuka smiling, sweat glistening over her extremely curvy and plump form. \u201cyou didn\u2019t rub it in enough Hayami-kun.\u201d She cooed, rubbing his arms as Hayami\u2019s eyes were all over Shizuka, from her angelic face and golden eyes to her bursting bosom, stuffed stomach, and thick thighs. He bit his lip and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks sensei.\u201d He said as he rubbed it in some more. \u201cWould you need help getting some on your back?\u201d He asked. \u201cI would be-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot happening bucko,\u201d Saya intervened, face in a scowl. \u201cI will take care of sensei and she can take of me. No touchy for you,\u201d the pinkette demanded. Clearly she didn\u2019t want thoughts of perversion to enter the head of the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can lather me up Hayami-kun~\u201d Cooed Miku as she hugged him from behind, her bosom pressing against him. \u201cLeave Takagi-san to sensei, and you can lather me up and protect me from the sun\u2019s harmful rays~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d Hayami blushed, unsure of what to do. The idea of sunscreen-ing up Yuuki Miku was a venture worth taking, if the bulge in his jeans indicated. But the glare Saya was giving him gave him other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen who would lather up Yuuki-san?\u201d Asked Shizuka, tone ditzy as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHayami-kun of course~!\u201d Miku said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is not! He will lather ME up!\u201d Saya blurted up, then covered her mouth, face beat pink as everyone stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiku began to laugh. \u201cHa! Now I get it, you want Hayami-kun all to yourself huh~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2019re wrong!

Once Hayami-kun is lathered, he will stand guard.\u201d She gave him a look. \u201cWon\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026\u201d Hayami looked back and forth between the girls.

In his mind, Hayami couldn\u2019t help, but curse inwardly, a part of his hormones wanting nothing more than to indulge Miku in her offer and rub the slick, oily sunblock all along her swollen figure. With the way he\u2019s seen, the orange haired school girl definitely had an ass on her now, her striped panties having been subjected to being gobbled up by the rotund and creamy cheeks of her hefty bum. He\u2019s felt first hand that Miku\u2019s ass was her best feature and rubbing sun block along her that same rear would be nothing short of a perverse nirvana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as leader to the grouping of beautiful maidens, Hayami had to remember that his enjoyment and indulgences would need to come second. Saya did prove a point earlier with someone needing to be on guard while they rubbed on their sun block and since the frustrated pinkette had already pulled up a reasonable order amongst them on who would lather who up, then that left Hayami to deal with keeping watch on the zombie count in case any decided to show up. Like it or not, Saya had given him a good reason on why he shouldn\u2019t give in to Miku\u2019s lust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, you\u2019re always being a royal stick in the mud.\u201d Miku huffed in a spoiled manner, the orange haired school girl shooting Saya a nasty scowl with the pinkette narrowing her eyes right back. It had been obvious that both Saya and Miku were at odds since the other day, Hayami seeming to pick up on this himself. Though was this friction caused by their personalities clashing...or something else? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let Hayami relax and have some fun for once. You\u2019re always dragging him down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragging him down?\u201d Saya snarled, her hand clenching tightly on the plastic bottle of sunscreen. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get serious for once instead of trying to get your damn rocks off. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re in the middle of the apocalypse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, so you think that gives you an excuse to boss us around? You think that since you could run the school back there that you can do the same with us?\u201d Miku snapped back, her sharp eyes burning daggers into Saya as she turned around and leaned forward slightly, the minx ready to pounce with her claws let out. \u201cFucking control freak, you just want pussy-whip poor Hayami until he\u2019s nothin\u2019 but your faithful little slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPussy whip? I\u2019m actually helping Hayami in getting us to a safe place to live or has your head been so far up your fat ass that you can\u2019t see that?\u201d Saya barked, the two feuding females thoroughly able to touch lips with how close they\u2019ve drawn to each other\u2019s faces. Shizuka was stuck as the middlewoman, the bloated nurse blinking in bewilderment as the two fumed schoolgirls hissed at one another ready to get physical after just another batch of insults being thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBossy skank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFoul slut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, enough was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough! Both of you!\u201d The two warring ladies froze to the loud command and turned their heads toward Hayami who wore a fierce expression. It wasn\u2019t rocket science on why he was rather disappointed in the both of them. \u201cUgh...listen, I\u2019ll stand guard, okay? You all just get your sunscreen on so we can leave. We can\u2019t exactly afford to stay out in the open very long...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...You\u2019re actually taking her side again?\u201d Miku spoke up, her voice seeming to echo with a sense of betrayal. Hayami halted, the teenager figuring his decision would quell the dueling teens from their squabble. Instead, it seems to have only inflamed one problem even further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m...not taking anyone\u2019s side, I\u2019m just-\u201c Hayami began, but the orange haired girl wouldn\u2019t allow him to finish as she threw herself onto her feet and stormed off away from the group. \u201cM-Miku, wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you!\u201d Was all he got back in return as Miku situated herself to the shade of another tree that just happened to be away from Hayami and the others. Hayami took a step forward to give chase, but found himself stopped by Shizuka as she gave him a thoughtful expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet her cool off, Hayami-kun...I\u2019ll talk to her later.\u201d Shizuka offered, the teenager blinking a bit as the busty ditz shed on him a side that had the traits of...a responsible adult. Shizuka had portrayed herself as airheaded and rather childish up until now, so...maybe there was something more beneath her than just the way she acted? \u201cMiku-chan seems really frustrated about something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, frustrated is one way of putting it...\u201d Saya muttered under her breath, the nurse aggressively bumping onto Saya with her engorged bosom and giving her a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you, don\u2019t be so coarse with her. I know you two have haven\u2019t really been getting along, but like it or not, we need to get through this together.\u201d Shizuka scolded, Saya left more than a little flabbergasted by Shizuka\u2019s rather maternal display. Looks like Shizuka was more than just a walking example of excessive jiggle physics. \u201cNow, hold still, we need to get sunscreen on you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Miku? I don\u2019t think she\u2019d want either of us near her now...\u201d Hayami inquired, looking up to the lone orange haired girl who sat under the tree with her knees pressing onto her swollen chest. Hayami still felt largely at fault for setting her off and part of him knew why she had gotten so upset with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll lather up, Miku-chan~\u201d Shizuka smiled warmly as Saya handed her the sunscreen. \u201cI\u2019ll use our time together to try and talk to her. Though, it will depend on you two if you want her to open back up to you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami didn\u2019t respond much, but simply nodded and turned around toward the way they came. However, as the teenager kept watch on the empty roads ahead, his mind was still victim to distraction as the sounds of Shizuka and Saya were only but a few inches away from his ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh-Shizuka-sensai, why are you oiling me up there!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s covered doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a risk that it won\u2019t get sunburned there, Saya-chan. Trust me, I\u2019m a doctor~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami\u2019s face contorted, the urge to look back was growing by the second as his male imagination painted the picture of Shizuka with her hands somewhere...naughty. With his eyes blind to them, Hayami\u2019s imagination played the situation out as sensually as it could with Shizuka atop Saya and her oiled hands sliding through the pinkette\u2019s bountiful, jiggling cleavage. Their swollen middles smooshed together as Shizuka pressed down onto Saya\u2019s body, the nurse\u2019s large and bulbous rear swaying playfully as she slowly grinded her oily body against Saya\u2019s. Hayami was barely present in the real world, his senses clouded by the lewd prospects that his young mind was cooking up for him to enjoy. Fortunately, a sudden squeak from a furiously blushing Saya was enough to rouse him out of his lust laden trance and forcing him to look back to see what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya was sitting away from Shizuka with her plump legs crossed tightly over each other and her arms folded firmly over her large bosom. The pinkette was beet red with the blonde nurse behind her still chuckling playfully to her reaction. Hayami blinked with confusion as he looked between the two before Shizuka decided to handle Miku\u2019s sun screen application. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmhm, anyways, I\u2019ll handle Miku-chan. I\u2019ll be back later~!\u201d She said, rising up with a grunt of effort and wobbling a bit in place as she appeared unsure on how to carry the weight of her bloated frame. After a second or two, Shizuka was mobile again, Hayami throwing a glance to the retreating nurse\u2019s backside as he swayed to and fro, her swollen ass cheeks having expanded large enough to completely fill up Hayami\u2019s lap if she ever decided to sit on it. Of course, such a prospect was something he wouldn\u2019t mind happening. Now wanting to get caught staring, Hayami shifted his sights to Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d Hayami asked, Saya lookin up to him with an annoyed expression. \u201cAbout the whole Miku thing, I mean.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Hayami wasn\u2019t referring to the incident with Shizuka, her expression softened slightly as she sighed and leaned back. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s just that..Miku really plucks my nerves is all.\u201d Saya remarked, her hand subconsciously sliding across the bloated dome of her paunch. \u201cSeriously, doesn\u2019t she know how dire things are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she does...maybe she has her own way of handling it?\u201d Hayami offered, his words not entirely bringing a reassuring expression to Saya\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all know what she\u2019s been known for in school.\u201d Saya muttered, \u201cAll she\u2019s ever done was sleep around and flaunt her body around like that\u2019s going to get her anything she wants. I don\u2019t even know why you bothered saving someone like that...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t say that.\u201d Hayami frowned to the pinkette\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, Miku\u2019s definitely no saint, but she\u2019s human just like you and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right...\u201d Saya sighed, brushing her pink bangs from her bespectacled eyes as she turned her gaze upward to Hayami. There was a stretch of silence between the two as Saya opened her mouth, before clamming up once again, her lips pursed as she bit into them lightly. Naturally curious, Hayami leaned inward slightly hoping to get an answer out of Saya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething on your mind, Saya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Just focus on guard duty.\u201d So much for gleaning information out of her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami merely shrugged and turned back around, Saya\u2019s unwillingness to come clean with her inner thoughts somewhat worrying him since the two have be so open with one another up until this point. What could be going through her head? Was it something about him...about Miku? There was really no idea to tell, but perhaps the pinkette would come clean about it later?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Never the less, Hayami turned back to his guarding duties and focused on the road ahead, the ruined street stretching onward through the deserted town with varying relics to the chaos prior strewn about in random areas. With no people around, Hayami had to admit that things were pretty peaceful now, especially since they were in an area surrounded by woodland terrain. However, as Hayami was admiring the scenery that wasn\u2019t hints of the apocalypse, something shambling in the distance caught his eye. Instantly, the teenager\u2019s muscles tensed as he edge closer and squinted his eyes to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of Them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the abomination was not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami\u2019s heart nearly jumped from his chest as his eyes widened to see a group of Them making their way up the road. Their path was fixed and not at all random, which could only mean one thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaya, go get Shizuka and Miku, we\u2019re going into gas station.\u201d Hayami ordered to Saya, the pinkette perking up in surprise at the stern tone Hayami took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there more of--\u201d Saya didn\u2019t even finish as Hayami moved from her line of sight to show the slowly approaching party of corpses making their way directly toward them. Immediately, Saya recoiled from the sight of the walking dead dashed toward Shizuka and Miku in the distance. Hayami stood by, his grip tightening on his trusty metal bat as he glared to the oncoming zombies, his eyes scanning their numbers. There was about seven of them in total, most of them men, but there were a few women among their ranks. An eerie chill ran up the teenager\u2019s spine as he spied that, one of the female zombies actually didn\u2019t have that bad of a chest on her. Those tits almost being as huge as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHayami-kun!\u201d Shizuka spoke up, breaking the teen\u2019s concentration and forcing him to turn around to see the swollen nurse gesturing him back to the group. Not wanting to stick around any longer, Hayami turned and made a dash toward the gas station, the gaggle of hefty women trotting behind him as best they could given their swollen and jiggly frames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSl-slow down Hayami!\u201d Saya urged, her chest and belly bouncing about. \u201cThis cart can\u2019t exactly turn on a dime, you know!\u201d Which was true, the shopping cart was, by far, the most cumbersome object the group lugged around with them, the girls\u2019 weighty bodies a close second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami wordlessly complied with Saya\u2019s urgent complaint and slowed his advance allowing Shizuka and Miku to catch up as well. He had almost forgotten that neither were as spry as they used to be, Shizuka especially so with how heavy she has gotten in such a short amount of time. Hayami had even taken a glance back to see that Shizuka was holding up the bottom of her bloated and wobbling belly as she trotted behind the group, her chest bouncing wildly from just the running alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group carefully weaved their way through the damaged and overturned cars, before they reached the entrance to the abandoned gas station. Hayami held up his hand to get the girls to halt their advance before he placed his face onto the window to try and see if anyone was inside. While the shelves were messy and thrown into disarray, the store within seemed fairly empty with no sign of zombies or any survivors. However, splashes of blood on the counter and floor told of a struggle that went down here. Believing that the interior was secure, Hayami shoved the door open and swiftly ushered Saya and the others inside ahead of him while keeping watch to make sure that no other zombies were on their tail. Shizuka took to opening the second door to the gas station which gave Saya the much needed room to push the cart inside and allowed Miku in behind her. Once they were inside, Hayami and Shizuka followed in after, with the former breathing out a sigh of relief as he looked up to see if everyone was accounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so much for getting gas without a hitch.\u201d Hayami joked slightly as he turned back to find just one of Them wobbling his way forward in front of the gas station, the zombie bumping into an upturned car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeeze, how did they find us?\u201d Miku complained as she hopped up and parked her pudgy bum onto the counter, her ample ass cheeks squishing and oozing out across the counter and covering just about the entire vacant space it provided. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any of those things out there since last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right...we haven\u2019t seen... a single one of Them up until now...\u201d Saya added, the pinkette naturally out of breath from running in the hot summer sun for only a moment. She cursed under her breath as she pinched her slowly developing love handles that were beginning to ooze out over the tops of her snug fitting skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Something has been bugging me about them showing up ever since I saw them...\u201d Hayami said, his finger rubbing along his chin. \u201cThe way they were coming at us...it was like they were being lead to us by something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, lead to us...?\u201d Shizuka echoed as she hiccuped and placed a hand over her mouth. The nurses\u2019 swollen paunch had taken up to rumbling loudly, the group turning toward her as she rubbed her bloated dome uncomfortably. \u201cOrph...sorry, my tummy\u2019s a little upset from the jog...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayami turned back to the window and watched as the zombies began to pour into the area, the group of undead having now spread out instead of shambling forward in a group like they did before. Moreoever, they were running into things or just idly standing by instead of making any real progress toward the store. If anything, they had reached the gas station and had come to a complete stop in terms of trying to catch their prey. The sight awakened the churning gears of Hayami\u2019s mind as he turned back to Saya, the other resident intellectual of the team. \u201cCall it a hunch, but...I think our undead predators are blind as bats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuuuh?\u201d Miku uttered as she gaze Hayami a flat look. \u201cIf they\u2019re so blind, how are they following us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s right...\u201d Saya cut in, her eyes narrowed in thought. \u201cThey don\u2019t follow their eyesight like we do...I noticed a long time ago that the zombies had really off movement patterns. Like, some of them stand around, others wander in random places, sometimes running into junk that we would easily avoid. I was too panicked before to really realize it, but they\u2019ve been blind this entire time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now the question is; how are they following us.\u201d Hayami nodded as he turned back to the window, the teenager, idly plucking a bag of potato chips from the shelf nearby as he opened them up and started to chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, maybe they can like...sniff us out?\u201d Miku offered with a shrug, looking up as Shizuka was returning to the group with a few bottles of medicine cradled in her plump arms. Miku had forgotten how much wider the nurse was getting, but she was given a firm reminder of how much more her skirt could take of Shizuka\u2019s broadening hips. The answer being not much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood guess, we haven\u2019t really...bathed in awhile.\u201d Hayami nodded, his cheeks tinging at the mention of not having a shower. He was usually a pretty clean individual, so not having a routine shower was starting to make him feels sticky and a little gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut none of us stink that bad for there to really be a powerful scent.\u201d Saya mentioned, hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso true, so that leaves...\u201d Hayami hummed as he munched away on the salty potato crisps and tried to think back on anything worthwhile for information. Hayami\u2019s eyes widened as the next possible solution to this biological mystery presented itself. \u201cThe argument...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe argument between you and Miku.\u201d Hayami repeated, a part of him a little reluctant to poke at that wound, but found that he had little choice in the matter. \u201cThat has to have been the loudest thing in the area at the time, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr, well...\u201d Saya hesitated, her hand rubbing on the back of her head as it became obvious that she and Miku were to blame for drawing in more of the Undead. \u201cWe were pretty loud back there, yeah...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen that has to be it then.\u201d Hayami clenched his fist around the empty bag of chips and turned back to the zombies. \u201cThey can follow us by sound. The louder the sound, the easier it is for them home in on our locations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo as long as we\u2019re sneaky, we can get past all the zombies?\u201d Shizuka inquired, a finger on her softening chin as she tilted her head to Hayami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically, we just need to keep ourselves quiet if we can\u2019t beat them upfront. So long as we\u2019re quiet, I think their trail to us will taper off and they\u2019ll stop the chase until something else loud presents itself.\u201d Hayami explained. \u201cSo with that, how are we going to keep going with our plans. This place isn\u2019t exactly safe with Them around...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizuka\u2019s stomach gurgled uncomfortably once more, reminding the nurse that she was dealing with a somewhat potent bellyache from all the food that was trying to digest within her. Shizuka patted her loudly grumbling middle to settle her gut down, but to little avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention Shizuka-sensei\u2019s upset stomach could alert more of Them to us...\u201d Saya added, idly poking at the nurse\u2019s beachball like paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry, I\u2019ll try to find some antacids to calm my tummy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, even if that wasn\u2019t the case, we need to figure out how to get gas from those pumps and find new clothes too...\u201d Hayami pursed his lips as he gazed at the gaggle of walking corpses that were crowding the area. There was only seven of them, but that still outnumbered Hayami and his group by at least three. In order to get out of this situation alive, Hayami would need to come up with a plan to get the gas they needed for the trip or ignore it and simply go for the clothing instead.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>General Overview</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHighschool of the Dead is an anime/manga series that takes you for a ride on the Zombie Apocalypse bus. An outbreak of a mysterious pathogen in Japan is rapidly spreading, uprooting the unsuspecting and killing those unprepared. Out of them all, high school kids manage to survive long enough and in the midst of it all are looking for their parents to make sure that, at least their families made it out of this disaster alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor information regarding the series and it's concepts  -&gt; <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://highschool-of-the-dead.wikia.com/wiki/Highschool_of_the_Dead_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://highschool-of-the-dead.wikia.com/wiki/Highschool_of_the_Dead_Wiki</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What's gonna go down</b><br>\r\nThis interactive won't start at any point in the original series, more like it will have seperate stories that can start anywhere you like. It can involve the canon characters, original characters, or maybe even a mix of both. It's all up to you. I only ask that you try to stick to the premise of the original. Also, while it's not required, when making a character try to have them as an unsuspecting civilian. It helps add a feeling of urgency to their situation as opposed to making a military guy who has lots of guns and badassery at his disposal to kill zombies.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+Fetishes that can appear during this story...+<br>\r\n- Stuffing/Weight Gain<br>\r\n- Pregnancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStandard rules apply...<br>\r\n- Only female characters are to expand. Although this doesn't exclude male characters from appearing at all in the interactive.<br>\r\n- Please put forth effort in your chapters.<br>\r\n- Nothing completely outlandish in regards of expansion.<br>\r\n- Let's try to avoid the overly gross situations such as toilet stuff and the like. Burps are fine (farts too, if you play it for comedy), but nothing past that please.<br>\r\n- This is an 18+ interactive so sexual situations are allowed, just...try not to go overboard with them. Use in moderation, basically and try not to have the story revolve too much around it. Highschool of the Dead might be (in)famous for it's...increased amounts of fanservice, but it doesn't get in the way of the story...I think?</td>",
