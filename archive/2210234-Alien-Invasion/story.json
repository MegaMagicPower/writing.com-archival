            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To most people at Griffin Community Hospital, Margo Dietrich appeared to be your average 24-year-old woman.  A tall, attractive, brunette; Margo had been working at the hospital for the last 3 months in the Pediatrics Wing.  However, looks can be very deceiving; Margo Dietrich wasn\u2019t even human.  She was born Sorain Kekeva on the planet Maltor Prime \u2013 a member of the Maltorian species..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and 7 other Maltorians arrived on Earth 13 months earlier to observe the dominant species \u2013 Terrans. Every member of the team was genetically altered to appear human, given a Human identity and left on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 3:45 on a Friday afternoon and Margo was anxiously waiting for her shift to end.  Far from having a bad day, Margo had plans tonight \u2013 a co-worker had set her up on a blind date this evening.  There was just one last thing Margo needed to do before she left, and it was a task she didn\u2019t take lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo walked down the hall and entered Room #415 to find her favorite patient, 7-year-old David Collins, lying in bed.  David had been in the hospital for almost 2 weeks following complications from appendicitis.  He reminded Margo a lot of her at that age; a keen curiosity about almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello David, how are you feeling today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a lot better, Nurse Margo.\u201d Smiling, David said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go home tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents called while you were napping; they said to tell you that they\u2019ll be here tomorrow around noon to bring you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid\u2019s parents had to fly out west for a funeral following a sudden death in the family.  David\u2019s condition meant that, unfortunately, he had to stay behind.  Margo had promised his folks that she would look after him while they were gone.  <br>\r\nHearing his parents were coming home put a smile on David\u2019s face.  Looking at Margo, he said, \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss you, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you too, sweetie.\u201d Giving David\u2019s hand an affectionate squeeze, Margo said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been so strong and brave; I wish more of my patients were like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for my cartoons.\u201d Smiling, David said, \u201cYou want to stay and watch them with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could, but I\u2019ve got plans tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Trying to hide his disappointment, David said, \u201cHave fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, kiddo.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just before 4:45 when Margo stepped out of the shower.  As she wrapped a towel around herself, Margo walked out of the bathroom and closed the curtains in her bedroom.  Once that was finished, she walked over to her desk and pulled out a small circular device; similar in appearance to what the Terrans referred to as an Alexa. Placing it on the desk, she went over to the closet and retrieved a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin Log Entry \u2013 Day 413.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the towel to the floor, Margo started to get into the dress. \u201cIt has been my observation that Terran women typically signal their desire to mate by wearing clothing that reveals some, but not all, of their secondary sex characteristics.\u201d Glancing at her reflection in the mirror, satisfied by what she saw, she continued, \u201cWhat is considered to be too much is still a matter for debate; I can only hope that I have guessed correctly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the bathroom, Margo proceeded to do her hair and makeup; as she had become accustomed to doing since her arrival. It had taken her some time to get used to her hair, as Maltorians are naturally bald. As she started on her makeup, she said, \u201cHaving had little success in attracting a mate by myself, I have agreed to a co-worker\u2019s offer to \u2018fix me up\u2019 with a woman of her acquaintance.\u201d Putting on some lipstick, Margo said, \u201cThis offer appears to be a common occurrence among Terrans, so I run little risk of revealing too much about myself by accepting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Margo was interrupted by an alert from her phone. Walking out of the bathroom, she saw it was a text from Liz \u2013 the woman she\u2019d been set up with. Grabbing her phone, she read the text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you; Megan\u2019s told me all about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the bed, Margo said, \u201cAs I prepare to leave for my \u2018blind date,\u2019 as these assignations are known, I can\u2019t help but imagine Dhelo\u2019s reaction if she were to learn about tonight.\u201d Sighing, as she put on her boots, Margo said, \u201cShe was suspicious of my motives for taking this assignment; no doubt discovering that I was planning sexual congress with a Terran woman would only serve to confirm them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what time it was, and satisfied that she was ready, Margo grabbed her purse. As she walked out of the bedroom, she said, \u201cEnd Log Entry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo parked her car in front of the restaurant 20 minutes later.  After checking to make sure she had everything, Margo went inside the restaurant.  Shortly after stepping inside, she received a text notification on her phone.  Looking at it, she saw it was Liz again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m running a few minutes late; why don\u2019t you grab a table and I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked over to the hostess, Margo started to worry whether Liz was actually going to show up at all.  She\u2019d heard stories from co-workers about being \u2018stood up\u2019 on dates.  While she hadn\u2019t experienced that yet, Margo knew it was a possibility.  Putting a smile on her face, Margo looked at the hostess and said, \u201cI\u2019d like a table for two please; preferably in a quiet area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo followed the hostess through the restaurant and sat down in a booth in the corner.  Placing the menus on the table, the hostess said, \u201cYour server will be around shortly, is there anything else I can do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, actually, there is.\u201d Pausing, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m meeting someone; when they arrive, can you tell them where I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes had passed since Margo sat down at the table, and Liz hadn\u2019t shown up yet.  She passed the time by drinking her beer and observing her fellow restaurant-goers.  She liked to frequent places such as this; places that would give her the best opportunity to see Terrans in a social setting.  In many ways, she realized, they weren\u2019t that different from Maltorians.  Of course, Terrans were a few centuries behind technologically but socially the two species were pretty similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo was brought back to reality by the sound of someone clearing their throat.  Looking up, she saw an attractive looking brunette standing on the opposite end of the table.  A smile on her face, the brunette said, \u201cAre you Margo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends.\u201d With a quizzical smile, Margo said, \u201cAre you Liz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Liz.\u201d Reaching her hand out, Liz said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you; Megan\u2019s told me all about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Believe me, she hasn\u2019t.</i>  Shaking the offered hand, Margo said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too; I\u2019ll be honest; when I saw you were going to be late, I thought you might stand me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d Sitting down, with a chuckle, Liz said, \u201cBesides, Megan wouldn\u2019t let me hear the end of it if I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I started drinking without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Pausing, Liz said, \u201cSo Megan tells me you just moved out here a few months ago?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo had spent the first 7 months on Earth living out in California; but it was too crowded for her, so she decided to relocate to a small town.  \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019d just gotten out of a pretty serious relationship, and I wanted to get away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand that.\u201d Looking at Margo, Liz said, \u201cWith my track record, I was starting to wonder if the girl for me was even on this planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are more right than you know.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The date ended up going better than Margo had expected; as she realized there was definitely something about Liz that she liked.  They spent most of the date getting to know each other; Margo found out that Liz worked as an elementary school teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the restaurant, Liz turned to Margo and said, \u201cYou feel like coming back to my place?\u201d with a hopeful smile, Liz said, \u201cWe can have a few drinks and maybe see where the evening takes us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo quickly realized what Liz was implying, and it surprised her.  It had been her experience that Terrans typically frowned upon having sex on the first date.  The opposite was true for Maltorians; who always slept with a prospective mate on the first date.  With a smile, Margo said, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can imagine their surprise when Margo and Liz realized they lived in the same apartment complex; in fact, their buildings were only four down from each other.  After parking her car in front of her building, Margo walked down to meet Liz outsider her building.  As they walked up the steps, Liz said, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind the clutter in my living room, I\u2019ve got a bunch of dioramas to grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d With a mischievous smile, Margo said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be spending much time in the living room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings started happening not long after they arrived at Liz\u2019s apartment.  Thanks to an inhibitor she\u2019d taken before the date, Margo was unaffected by the copious amount of alcohol that she and Liz consumed \u2013 but she did have to act as though she were.  Things eventually moved to the bedroom where the two made love to each other for almost an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them lay in bed together, looking at each other with smiles on their faces, Liz said, \u201cThat was the best sex I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo knew that Terrans didn\u2019t like being compared to someone previous mate; but she had to admit that Liz was, in some ways, better in bed than Dhelo.  \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think less of me for putting out on the first date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, you\u2019re fine.\u201d Chuckling, Liz said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if I thought it would be a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet someone who shares that belief.\u201d Looking at Liz, Margo said, \u201cI have to make sure I thank Megan for introducing us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them lay in bed together, listening as a light rain hit the window.  The silence was soon interrupted by the sound of a ringing cell phone.  Once Margo realized it was her phone, she got up and dug it out of her purse.  Her post-sex euphoria was short-lived when she saw it was a text from Kevin Anderson.  That, of course, was his cover ID; his real name was Tervin Dejora \u2013 he was another member of the observation team.  It didn\u2019t help that the text was just two words \u2013 <b>Code Red.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPer the mission guidelines, Code Red was only to be used in the most extreme circumstances.  Of course, the arrival of the text meant Margo\u2019s evening was over.  Taking a deep breath, Margo turned back to look at Liz in bed.  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this, but a family emergency has come up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201d Sitting up in bed, Liz said, \u201cI hope everything is alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope so too, but I doubt it.  \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d Grabbing her clothes from the floor, Margo said, \u201cDo you have plans this weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really.\u201d Smiling, Liz said, \u201cAre you asking me out on a second date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really enjoyed the first one, and the sex was amazing.\u201d Chuckling, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019d love to see where things go from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll text you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick 5-minute walk back to Margo\u2019s apartment.  Walking into the bedroom, she closed the curtains and pulled a small tablet from the desk.  After inputting a code, she waited for a response \u2013 which came in the form of a scruffy looking male in his early 20s.  \u201cThis better be important, Tervin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important, Sorain.\u201d Taking a breath, Khals said, \u201cThe satellite we placed in orbit has detected an incoming energy signature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnergy signature?\u201d confused, Margo said, \u201cIs it the retrieval team?  I thought we had another 3 months?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the retrieval team.\u201d Pausing, Khals said, \u201cThe energy signature is Creelaxian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo went pale when she heard that.  \u201cHow long we do we have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey should arrive in orbit within the hour.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake your way to the rendezvous point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Well, they were sadly killed in a car accident when Olivia was 7 years old; she\u2019d been in the car with them, but she survived with only a broken arm and a mild concussion.  Rather than let her end up in the system Eric, who had just turned 18, became her legal guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting close to 9:00 and Olivia knew Eric was going to be home soon.  She was sitting in her room texting with her best friend Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><b>I don\u2019t understand why Eric hates Kyle so much.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s 19 years old and you\u2019re only 14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m surprised Eric hasn\u2019t done anything to Kyle yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Girl, why do you have to take Eric\u2019s side?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not taking Eric\u2019s side, I\u2019m just trying to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Kyle tries to take advantage of you or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Olivia saw the reflection of headlights move across her wall \u2013 someone was pulling into the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\"><b>I g2g, Eric\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll ttyl</b><br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting to see Emily\u2019s response, Olivia walked downstairs to the door.  Opening the door, expecting to see Eric, she was surprised to see Kyle standing there.  \u201cKyle, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe, I just got off work and thought we could hang out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, but my brother is going to be home soon.\u201d Sighing, Olivia said, \u201cHe\u2019s still upset with you for drinking his beer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Walking into the house, Kyle said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a few days; I thought maybe we could go up to your room or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was starting to feel uneasy at this point; Kyle wasn\u2019t usually this pushy.  \u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, babe!\u201d groaning, Kyle said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating for 2 months and we haven\u2019t even had sex yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if Emily is right?</i>  \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Olivia\u2019s hand, Kyle said, \u201cCome on, what if we just make out on your bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to do, and feeling uneasy, Olivia silently closed the door and followed Kyle upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 9:20 when Eric Sheppard got home from work.  Having just gotten off a long day at work, he was looking forward to relaxing and watching a movie with Olivia.  Pulling into the driveway, he groaned when he saw the familiar car of Kyle Wilcox \u2013 Olivia\u2019s 19-year-old boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, what\u2019s that asshole doing here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking the car in the garage, Eric entered the house; only to find no sign of Olivia or Kyle anywhere.  He was about to call Olivia\u2019s name when he heard her voice from upstairs.  \u201cStop Kyle, I said no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, Eric ran upstairs to Olivia\u2019s room; bursting into the room to find Olivia and Kyle on the bed, with Kyle\u2019s hands groping Olivia\u2019s chest.  \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d pulling Kyle away from Olivia, Eric said, \u201cGet away from her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia got up and stood behind Eric; a nervous expression on her face.  Looking at him, she said, \u201cHe came by a few minutes ago; I didn\u2019t think he should be here, but he came in anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a quick glance to Olivia, Eric saw she was starting to tear up.  Turning his attention to Kyle, he said, \u201cYou must be the dumbest person in the world; I\u2019m a cop and you\u2019re here trying to take advantage of my sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, man, I don\u2019t know what you think is going on here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know exactly what\u2019s going on here.\u201d Still in his uniform, Eric retrieved his handcuffs and said, \u201cI\u2019m taking you in, you son of a bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Eric could take one step towards him, Kyle made a fist and punched him in the nose.  Staggering from the unexpected punch, Eric watched as Kyle grabbed Olivia and pulled her out of the room.  Regaining his balance, Eric ran down the stairs after them; listening as Olivia pleaded with Kyle to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric managed to get outside just as Kyle\u2019s car peeled out of the driveway.  As he ran to his car, Eric remembered a promise he made to his parents when Olivia was born \u2013 that he would always do everything he could to keep her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving down the street, Eric grabbed his police scanner and said, \u201cThis is Officer Sheppard; be on the lookout for a 2016 silver F150, license plate 327-XDC.\u201d Turning onto the main road, I said, \u201cDriver has assaulted an officer and taken a minor against her will.\u201d</span></div></div>",

God, Emily was right; I never should have gotten together with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point, Kyle had driven them both to the outskirts of town.  Pulling over along the road overlooking the dam, he turned to Olivia and said, \u201cPlease, you were practically begging me to ask you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can consider this my dumping you.\u201d Getting out of the car, Olivia turned to look at Kyle and said, \u201cI never want to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was about to say something he was interrupted by a loud roaring noise coming from overhead.  Suddenly the surrounding area lit up like daylight as a flaming object flew past overhead; crashing in the hills on the other side of the dam.  Forgetting the argument with Olivia, he turned to her and said, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet in, let\u2019s go check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Olivia realized getting back into the car was a bad idea, but another part of her wanted to see what it was that crashed.  As Kyle drove down towards the access road, Olivia got her phone out and called Eric.</span></div></div>",

It looked like it was going in the direction of the dam, so he decided to head that way.  As he drove down the road, his cell phone started to ring.  Seeing it was Olivia, he answered it and said, \u201cOlivia! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re up by the dam; something crashed nearby and we\u2019re checking it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything until I get there, I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be an almost 10-minute drive to the damn.  Driving through the damaged gate blocking the access road, Eric drove about \u00bd a mile before he saw Olivia standing on the side of the road.  As soon as Eric got out of the car, Olivia ran over to him in tears.  Hugging him, she said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, O.\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing towards a glow in the distance, Olivia said, \u201cHe went to check out what crashed.\u201d Looking at Eric, Olivia said, \u201cI-I have no idea what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter retrieving his gun from the car, in case Kyle tried anything funny, Eric followed Olivia through the woods to the clearing.  Once in the clearing, Eric could tell why Olivia had no idea what the object was \u2013 as even he\u2019d never seen anything like it before.  Whatever it was, it was shaped like an oval and was probably around 12 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was so entranced by the object that he briefly forgot why he was here.  That was until he caught sight of Kyle near the far end of the object.  Running up to him, Eric grabbed him by the collar and said, \u201cI ought to beat the shit out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever man; it\u2019s not like I did anything wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, smart guy?\u201d shoving him, Eric said, \u201cFirst you assaulted a minor, then you assaulted police officer followed by abducting said minor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kyle could respond, he was interrupted by a low humming noise. The noise got louder until an opening into the object appeared behind Kyle. Looking at the opening, he said, \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his phone, Eric said, \u201cI\u2019m calling this in.\u201d he was about to dial his chief\u2019s number when he saw Kyle walk through the opening.  \u201cDon\u2019t go inside, you idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Kyle from continuing inside; Eric had to keep Olivia from going inside after him.  Instead, she stood behind Eric and yelled out, \u201cKyle, come back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud noise from inside the object; almost if something had slammed shut. After a moment, Olivia and Eric heard banging and what sounded like Kyle calling for help. Olivia started towards the opening, but Eric stopped her and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go in and check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Olivia stayed outside, Eric went through the opening and found himself in the strangest place he\u2019d ever been in. There were several consoles and what looked like pipes, all leading to a hollow tube in the middle of the room \u2013 with Kyle inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric walked towards the tube, he could hear Kyle\u2019s muffled attempts to speak. \u201cGet me out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d checking around the tube, Eric said, \u201cNext time how about you don\u2019t go inside the strange object.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, Eric couldn\u2019t find anything of use to him; everything seemed to have some strange writing on it.  <i>What the hell is this place?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there were footsteps behind him, Eric turned around to find Olivia walking over to the tube.  \u201cKyle, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; just get me out of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the room filled with the sound of distant rumbling. Olivia and Eric could only watch as some strange gas started seeping into the chamber; followed by Kyle suddenly doubling over in pain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia and Eric were momentarily unable to do anything as confusion set in.  Suddenly Eric found the urge to beat the shit out of Kyle being replaced with the urge to get him out of the tube.  While Eric started looking for a way to get Kyle out, he turned to Olivia and said, \u201cO, find something to break the glass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t move; instead, she just stood there in front of the tube, mesmerized but what was happening inside. Whatever the gas was that was entering the chamber, it was having a shocking effect on Kyle \u2013 it was changing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first notable change that Eric and Olivia saw was Kyle\u2019s skin changing from its normal white color to dark green. It wasn\u2019t that the skin color was changing; the skin itself was also changing, as scales appeared on his body. Slamming a hand on the glass, struggling to fight the pain, Kyle said, \u201cG-Get m-me out o-of here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his gun out, Eric fired a few shots at the tube; only to find whatever it was made of to be bulletproof.  While Eric went back to searching for something to break the chamber, Olivia did what she could to keep Kyle\u2019s spirits up, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get you out of there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time almost 90% of Kyle\u2019s body was covered in scales; with the changes now progressing to his face. The changes reminded me of those cheesy transformation scenes in old movies; as Kyle\u2019s face slowly changed to resemble a canine snout. Another shocking change was the sudden appearance of a second, slightly smaller, set of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Eric gave up searching because he was too engrossed by what was happening in the tube.  By this point, Kyle\u2019s screams of pain had turned into guttural, almost primal, growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kyle fell to his knees, as a series of cracking noises escaped the chamber. Eric and Olivia could only watch in silent horror as Kyle\u2019s legs bent themselves into an impossible position. While this was happening, Kyle\u2019s feet and hands changed into paws; each with 3 sharp claws protruding from them. Eric quickly realized that, by this point, the Kyle they knew no longer existed \u2013 having been replaced by a large, scaly, quadrupedal creature. Unfortunately, the changes didn\u2019t stop there; the creature\u2019s back started to bubble up; as a series of sharp spines burst out of its skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was left of the gas soon dissipated, which gave Eric and Olivia a clear image of the creature inside the chamber.  It looked to be about the size of a large bulldog; with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. It must\u2019ve sensed there were in the room because suddenly it started growling and clawing at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without warning, the chamber door opened. Before Eric could stop her, Olivia stepped closer to the creature. Reaching her hand out, she said, \u201cK-Kyle, are you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia got an answer, just not the one she wanted, when the creature lunged at her. Before she knew what was happening, the creature had latched onto Olivia\u2019s arm. Hearing Olivia\u2019s screams caused Eric to spring into action; as he went about trying to save his sister.  Eric went behind the creature and tried to pull it off Olivia, but that only served to make it angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature released its grip on Olivia and turned its attention to Eric; as Olivia slowly tried to get away from it.  It wasn\u2019t long before Eric was on his back trying to keep the creature from biting him.  The room was suddenly filled with the sound of gunfire; followed by the creature\u2019s pained cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Eric saw Olivia aiming his gun at the creature.  In pain, but still able to fight, the creature lunged towards Olivia; only for her to finally kill it with a shot to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the floor, Eric made his way over to Olivia as she collapsed to the floor in shock.  He quickly went about making a tourniquet for Olivia\u2019s badly mangled arm. Once that was taken care of, the two of them just stared at the creature lying in a pool of blood on the floor \u2013 wondering what could have turned a human being into something like that.</span></div></div>",

Eric had moved Olivia outside of the pod and leaned her up against the hull.  Looking at her, he said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy arm is killing me, Eric.\u201d Sighing, Olivia said, \u201cBut it looks like the bleeding has slowed down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Eric spotted the flashing lights of an ambulance in the distance.  Getting up, he looked at Olivia and said, \u201cStay here, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric ran through the woods back to the road; arriving just as several patrol cars arrived behind the ambulance.  Running up to one of the EMTs, Eric said, \u201cMy sister is in the clearing nearby, and her arm is pretty torn up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the EMTs started running towards the clearing, Eric was approached by the last person he wanted to see.  Adam Williams was another officer in the department; for some reason he never particularly liked Eric, and the feeling was mutual.  \u201cHave you been drinking, Sheppard?\u201d looking at Eric, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only explanation I can think of for your outrageous report.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Williams, I haven\u2019t been drinking.\u201d Sighing, Eric said, \u201cMy sister\u2019s boyfriend got turned into some strange creature and subsequently attacked her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t a wolf that attacked your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the derisive tone of William\u2019s voice, Eric said, \u201cListen here, Williams; I know what I saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll just have to see for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric followed Williams through the woods to the clearing; arriving as the EMTs were loading Olivia onto a gurney.  Seeing Eric, one of them walked over and said, \u201cYour sister\u2019s lost a lot of blood, we need to take her to the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\nNodding in acknowledgment, Eric walked over to Olivia and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you; I just want to make sure everything is good here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the EMTs left with Olivia, Eric walked over to the pod entrance where Williams was standing.  He arrived just as the creature was being removed; turning just in time to see William\u2019s face turn to one of horror.  \u201cThat\u2019s no wolf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to tell you, Williams.\u201d Gesturing to the creature as it was carried past, I Eric said, \u201cThat thing used to be my sister\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the clearing was awash with light; as a series of helicopters suddenly appeared overhead.  Before Eric could ask what was going on, he saw half a dozen soldiers come out of the woods and into the clearing. They made their way over to where everyone was standing. One of the soldiers, an older man, said, \u201cI\u2019m Colonel Jackson; I have to ask that you all leave the area immediately.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cThis is now a government operation, your presence is not required.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wanted to argue with the man but thought better of it. Turning to the other cops, as the ranking officer on the scene, Eric said, \u201cYou heard the man, everyone leave the area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric followed everyone out of the clearing; as helicopters started landing more troops to cordon off the area.  He didn\u2019t have time to think about that now; because his chief concern was going to the hospital to check on Olivia.</span></div></div>",

It's a miracle she didn't bleed out.\" Looking at the clipboard, he said, \"Her blood work shows that she's fighting an infection; which we're administering antibiotics to combat it, we should know in the morning if it's successful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched as the doctor left the room, closing the door behind him.  Once he was certain they were alone, Eric went over to Olivia\u2019s bedside.  Taking her hand, he said, \u201cHey O, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painkillers they had Olivia on must\u2019ve made her pretty out of it.  Looking at Eric, she flashed a weak smile and said, \u201cHey big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing Olivia\u2019s hand, Eric said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good; although that\u2019s probably from the drugs.\u201d Taking a breath, Olivia said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Kyle?  Is he alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wasn\u2019t sure if Olivia had short term amnesia or what, but he didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her the truth in her current condition.  With a heavy sigh, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s down the hall, O; he\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drugs took effect a few minutes later, and Olivia fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upstairs in the Pediatrics Wing, Margo was carefully making her way down the hall to David\u2019s room.  While she knew in her heart she was doing to the right thing, Margo couldn\u2019t help but worry about the consequences if she was caught \u2013 after all, she was technically kidnapping a child from the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into David\u2019s room, she saw that he was fast asleep in bed.  <i>He has no idea his world is about to change forever.</i>  Grabbing his Batman backpack from a nearby chair, Margo started filling it with clothes from the small dresser against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her best efforts to make as little noise as possible, David still woke up while she was packing his clothes.  Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes and said, \u201cNurse Margo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, sweetie.\u201d Putting the backpack down, Margo went over to David\u2019s bed and said, \u201cHow would you like to go on a little adventure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Still sleepy, David said, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one part of the plan Margo was still trying to figure out.  She had just over an hour, at this point, to make her way to the rescue pod at the rendezvous, and she still had to get Liz.  Looking at David, trying her best to sound reassuring, Margo said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to someplace fun, how\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill my parents be there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo knew the likelihood that David\u2019s parents would survive almost zero, but she knew better than to tell him that.  \u201cOf course they will, sweetie.\u201d Putting the backpack on her back, Margo reached towards David and said, \u201cNow come on, we have to go.\u201d<br>\r\nDavid quickly climbed up into Margo\u2019s arms and held on as she left the room. As they made their way to the exit, Margo was surprised when no one tried to stop her from taking David.  Little did she know; everyone was in the break room listening to a news report about a series of fireballs in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator ride to the lobby seemed to take forever, but they eventually reached the lobby.  Margo thought she was home free until she heard \u201cCode Purple\u201d come over the hospital PA system.  Margo figured someone must\u2019ve gone to check on David, only to find him missing.  She knew it was only a matter of time before security found her.  \u201cMargo?\u201d Looking up at her, David said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning down the hall to the ER, Margo said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry sweetie, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Margo said, \u201cWhatever happens next, just know that it\u2019s all to keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Margo ran around the corner, she stopped in her tracks at the sight of a security guard blocking her path to the exit.  He suddenly turned around and saw Margo standing there with David.  \u201cFreeze!\u201d raising his gun, the officer said, \u201cLet the kid go, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was starting to get frightened, Margo could hear him whimpering.  <i>I\u2019m not going to let this child suffer at the hands of the Creel.</i>  Reaching her free hand around to her back, she grabbed her gun and pulled it from her belt.  After ensuring that it was set to stun, she raised it and aimed it at the officer.  \u201cThis child\u2019s life is in danger; I have to get him to safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut the gun down, ma\u2019am; or I will open fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombat training was required for all Maltorians between the ages of 13 and 18; Margo had a reputation in her training group for being the best shot.  \u201cTrust me; you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the room filled with a rumbling noise filled the room; followed by a series of distant explosions.  Turning around, the guard said, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her chance, Margo shot the guard and watched as he dropped to the floor.  Running past the fallen guard, she stopped in her tracks when she saw an explosion in the parking lot.  <i>Oh no, I\u2019m too late.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was screaming in fear at this point.  With her escape route cut off, Margo turned and ran back the way she came.  Having an understanding of Creel battle tactics, Margo knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before they swarmed the hospital looking to capture anyone they could.  As she tried to find a place to hide, she looked down at David and said, \u201cSweetie, everything is going to be alright.  I promise.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That was, however, until a loud rumbling sound from outside woke her up.  Getting out of bed, grumbling, Liz walked over to her bedroom window.  <i>Damn kids blaring their car stereos in the middle of the night.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her curtain, Liz was surprised to find not a group rowdy teens but a strange object landing in the grass across from her building.  \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confusion turned to horror when she saw some strange looking creatures, both bipedal and quadrupedal, come out of an opening in the object.  She brought a hand to her mouth in shock; as she watched the creatures venture out into the complex.  She watched helplessly as one of them pulled a pregnant woman from her car; while another threw something inside that caused the car to fill with smoke.  She didn\u2019t know who was in the car with the pregnant woman but, seconds later, two of the quadrupedal creatures burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of that was enough for Liz to close her curtain and run into the bathroom.  She closed the door just as her front door was torn open.  Looking for anything she could use as a weapon, she was as silent as she could possibly be.  The sound of footsteps told her something was in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought she was in the clear until an explosion outside caused her to scream in terror \u2013 which was enough for the creature to burst into the bathroom.  This gave Liz her first up-close look at one of the bipedal creatures \u2013 a massive creature of over 6 feet in height; with dark green scales, sharp claws on the hands and feet and a series of horns above the nose.  Liz struggled in vain to keep away from the creature, but it grabbed her and carried her out of the apartment and towards the object in the parking lot.</span></div></div>",

Where am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the events of last night flashed in his mind and he realized he was in the hospital.<i>Adrenaline must have taken me as far as it could,</i> he thought. <i>Then I crashed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had a vague memory of falling asleep in a chair in the ICU waiting room. Sitting up in the chair, a crick in his neck, he decided to go check on Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric went to the door; only to find that it was blocked on the other side by a shelf on wheels.  <i>What the hell is going on here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pushing the heavy shelf out of the way, Eric made his way down to Olivia's room - only then realizing how quiet the floor was.  It was the ICU, it should have been abuzz with activity but there was no one in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rounded the corner leading to Olivia's room; finding that it too was blocked.  Eric wondered why someone would go to the effort to keep Olivia and him in their rooms; until it dawned on him - what if they were keeping something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort to move the portable x-ray machine from the doorway, but Eric eventually made it into Olivia\u2019s room.  Even standing in the doorway, Eric could tell something was wrong - Olivia looked paler than she had when they got to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his attempts to stay quiet, Olivia started to stir.  Slowly opening her eyes, she said, \u201cEric?  What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital, O; you were attacked last night...by Kyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d shocked, Olivia said, \u201cIs he alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had made a promise years ago that he would never lie to Olivia; even if it put him into an awkward position.  Taking a breath, he recounted the events of last night.  When he was finished, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened after we got here; but the military had cordoned off the area around the pod.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe Kyle\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I particularly liked the guy, but no one deserves to go through what he did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a rumbling sound could be heard permeating through the building.  Looking at Eric, Olivia said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, O; but it might explain why the ICU is abandoned.\u201d Grabbing his gun from his jacket, Eric said, \u201cStay here, I\u2019m going to go look around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m lying in bed with god knows how many IVs in my arm.\u201d Raising an eyebrow to Eric, Olivia said, \u201cWhere exactly am I supposed to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you still have your sarcasm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure that Olivia was safe, Eric left to investigate the noise and see if he could find anyone else in the building.  <br>\r\nChecking every room as he went along, Eric eventually made it out of the ICU and over to the elevator lobby.  Hearing the rumbling noise again, he went to a nearby window; to find a large alien craft landing near the entrance to the ER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of him as Eric decided to go in the direction of ER.  But he quickly found obstacles in his path - in the form of non-functioning elevators.  He decided to take the stairs down but found the way blocked.  Turning around, he decided to up to the next level and find another way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairwell let him out in the vicinity of the Maternity Ward.  The sound of something crashing caught his attention; so he started off in the direction it came from.  As he got closer to the Maternity Ward, he was horrified to find blood and disarray in the halls.  <i>What happened here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the entrance to the Maternity Ward, he heard footsteps around the corner.  Before he could go around the corner to investigate, someone grabbed him from behind and pulled him into a nearby supply closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, ready to confront his assailant, Eric was surprised to find a heavily pregnant teenage girl staring back at him.  Raising a finger to her lips, whispering, the girl said, \u201cBe quiet if you want to stay alive.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even though the rain glass window, Eric could tell whatever was outside wasn\u2019t human.  The creature, whatever it was, sniffed the air for a few moments before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was satisfied they were in the clear, Eric turned to the young girl in front of him.  \u201cYou mind telling me what the hell is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d incredulous, the girl said, \u201cThose things have been here for hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who introduced herself as Madison Decker, proceeded to explain the events of the last few hours to Eric.  When she was finished, Eric was in disbelief \u2013 he didn\u2019t think anything like that was possible.  Then again he had witnessed his sister\u2019s boyfriend get turned into an alien creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had a chance to process what he\u2019d been told, Eric looked at Madison and said, \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019m still not clear about; if the hospital was being evacuated, why are you still here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome cops were escorting a group of us to safety; I fell behind when I started having contractions.\u201d Suddenly wincing in pain, Madison said, \u201cI suppose it was for the best; because those things took all the pregnant women, and some of the men, aboard their ship and took off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d suddenly concerned, Eric said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d Wincing, Madison said, \u201cMy contractions are getting worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all Eric needed to hear; if what Madison said was true, the aliens seemed unusually interested in pregnant women.  He wasn\u2019t going to let them take her.  Getting up, he walked over and pulled Madison to her feet.  \u201cWe have to get you out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d panicking, Madison said, \u201cThose things are everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a cop, Madison; it\u2019s my job to make sure you\u2019re safe.\u201d Opening the door a crack, Eric said, \u201cIt looks like the coast is clear, but we just have to make a quick stop first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Eric out of the supply closet, Madison said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s in the ICU; she was attacked by one of those dog-things you saw.\u201d Turning to Madison, trying to sound reassuring, <br>\r\nEric said, \u201cI promise that I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure you\u2019re both safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Wincing in pain, Madison said, \u201cWe just met; but for some reason, I feel like I should trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey back to the stairwell was as uneventful as Eric hoped; he spotted two of the tall creatures down the hall.  Seeing the stairwell door no more than 5 feet away, Eric motioned for Madison to follow.  Thankfully they made it to the stairwell, and down one floor, without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his gun in one hand and Madison\u2019s hand in another, Eric walked down the hall to the ICU.  Rounding the corner to Olivia\u2019s room, Eric stopped when he saw the x-ray machine had been moved.  Turning to Madison, silently telling her to stay put, he quietly walked down to the room.  He could see a shadowy figure through the blinds as he went by.  He suddenly heard a moan from inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking the door open, gun raised, he found himself staring at the girl from the elevator - only this time she was pointing a gun at his face.  \u201cYou?\u201d looking at her, Eric said, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The last time she\u2019d seen that look was when her best friend had been captured by the Creel.  \u201cFine, you\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cBefore we do anything, I need to know exactly what\u2019s wrong with your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure; the doctor said she\u2019s fighting some nasty infection \u2013 something she got when that creature attacked her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo stood still for a moment as she processed everything going on around her.  After a moment, she finally made her decision.  <br>\r\n\u201cOkay fine; against my better judgment, we\u2019ll try to get out of here.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to get a move going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was puzzled by Margo's choice of words but knew that this was neither the time nor the place to dwell on it.  \u201cOkay then; Margo, you go find a wheelchair for Madison.\u201d Looking at Olivia, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll carry Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo returned a moment later with a wheelchair; as she helped Madison into it, she said, \u201cMake sure you grab my bag; it has some medicine I think might be able to help Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd off they went.  As the five of them made their way through the hospital, they failed to encounter any creatures.  Margo was relieved to see that the Creel continued to underestimate all non-Creel life forms. Once they were in the parking lot, they found an intact SUV close to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Eric driving, and David sitting upfront with him, Margo was in back trying to get a handle Madison and Olivia.  Madison\u2019s contractions were coming every 20 seconds now; whereas the move had caused Olivia\u2019s heart rate to plummet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove through the deserted streets of the town, Margo considered her options.  She carried doses of antibiotics in case of emergencies, and this was certainly an emergency. However, these antibiotics were developed by Maltorian science, not Terran, and there was no what they would do to Olivia\u2019s system. On the other hand, it appeared that Terran science was ill-equipped to deal with the infection raging through Olivia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEric, I need to know how far you\u2019re willing to go in order to save Olivia\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d glancing back, Eric said, \u201cDo whatever you can to save her, Margo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the confirmation Margo needed; as she dug through her bag until she found the series of vials she was looking for.  As she filled a syringe with one of the vials, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m giving her an experimental antibiotic that should help her, but I\u2019m not sure what the side effects might be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it, Margo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo injected the syringe into Olivia\u2019s left arm; causing her veins to temporarily turn dark blue as the antibiotics moved through her system.  Before she could check to make sure Olivia was okay, Margo was Madison as she screamed, \u201cPull over!  I think I feel the baby\u2019s head!\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was dark so she couldn\u2019t see what they looked like, but she could tell they weren\u2019t human.  The creatures brought Liz, and the 6 other people with her, into a nearby building.  As she was led inside, Liz caught a fleeting glimpse of a nearby sign that said - Savanna Academy; a private school on the outskirts of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was led down the hall to one of the classrooms; walking inside to find that a large cell had been set up inside the room, along with a strange looking machine in front of the board.  The tall creatures pushed the group into the cell before walking out of the room.  Why are they putting us in cages?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz looked around the cell and got an idea of who was in there with her \u2013 mostly adults except for one frightened girl clutching her mother.  Making her way over to the girl and her mother, she said, \u201cEverything is going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d looking at Liz, the girl said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know where we are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw a sign outside that said Savanna Academy; that private school on the outskirts of town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those things?\u201d holding her daughter close, the mother said, \u201cWhat do they want with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am.\u201d Sighing, Liz said, \u201cBut we\u2019re alive, so they obviously need us for something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter started crying at that point, as the mother looked down at her and said, \u201cHailey, sweetie, everything is going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m scared, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Hailey, Liz said, \u201cYour mom\u2019s right, Hailey; everything is going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of the large creatures entered the room and made its way to the cage.  Coming inside, it came directly over to Hailey and forcibly removed her from her Mom\u2019s arms.  \u201cMommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d going after the creature, the mom tried to rescue her daughter.  \u201cLet her go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout stopping, the creature pushed the mom aside as it removed Hailey from the cell.  While two others tended to the mother, <br>\r\nLiz watched as the creature removed Hailey\u2019s clothing before placing her inside the tube.  As Hailey tried, in vain, to get out of the tube; Liz looked at her and said, \u201cHailey, honey, everything is going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature pressed a button on the side of the tube; which caused a strange gas to fill the tube.  Behind her, Liz could hear the <br>\r\nmom yelling, \u201cHailey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the gas dissipated enough to allow everyone to see inside.  The room was soon filled with an assortment of gasps and horrified screams \u2013 whatever the gas was; it had turned Hailey from a cute young girl into something that resembled a bipedal reptile.</span></div></div>",

As the gas started to dissipate, she could hear the muffled reactions of everyone in the cell.  <i>What\u2019s going on?</i>  Hailey\u2019s confusion soon turned to horror when she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the glass tube.  Gone were her freckles, red hair and blue eyes; replaced with a face covered in green scales, orange eyes and a series of bumps going from her nose up through her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey brought a hand up to her mouth as she screamed in horror; only to find that her hand suddenly had 4 sharp looking claws instead of fingers.  Not only that, but she quickly realized her entire body was now covered in green scales.  She noticed her feet had changed as well; now having 3 toes that ended with claws.  <i>What did they do to me!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube suddenly opened and, before the creature outside could stop her, Hailey ran to the cage door.  Whatever had been done to her must\u2019ve increased her strength, because she was able to rip the locking mechanism off the gate without a problem.  <br>\r\nEveryone avoided her, except for her mom and the woman who\u2019d tried to comfort her.  Going up to her mom, she wrapped her arms tightly around her, \u201cMommy, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, sweetie; but don\u2019t worry.\u201d Trying to sound reassuring, Hailey\u2019s mom said, \u201cEverything is going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you say that!\u201d looking down at her body, Hailey said, \u201cI-I\u2019m a monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a monster, Hailey.\u201d Looking at her, Mom said, \u201cYou\u2019re still my precious little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the creature came inside the cage and grabbed Hailey; pulling her away from her Mom.  \u201cNo! Let me go!\u201d trying to free herself, she said, \u201cMommy. Help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mom was unable to do anything, as she was paralyzed with shock.  The creature led Hailey down the hall; where she found herself with 5 other kids who looked similar to her.  Every one of them, Hailey included, was crying in fear \u2013 uncertain of what was going to happen to them next.  They didn\u2019t have to wait long as three of the creatures appeared and corralled them outside to where a ship was waiting for them.  The six kids were all ushered onto the ship; each of them looking around with a mixture of fear and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took a seat along the wall Hailey watched as two of the creatures brought a sealed container, about the size of a chest freezer, on board.  It was only then that Hailey realized her sense of smell was suddenly stronger than before.  She wasn\u2019t sure what the smell was that was coming from the container, but something told her it was a good smell.</span></div></div>",

It was hard for her to do that, because she felt the same way they did.  Hailey watched out the window as her town receded from view, wondering where they were being taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the ship to make it into orbit; after a few minutes, Hailey could see a much larger ship approaching.  It was brown in color and resembled an egg with four spires jutting out from the sides.  <i>Is that where they\u2019re taking us?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey soon had her answer as the shuttle approached a large opening on the side of the ship.  Looking out the window, Hailey saw a dozen or so alien creatures that looked like her.  Suddenly someone grabbed Hailey\u2019s hand, startling her.  Looking down she saw a young child, probably no older than 5 years old, looking at her.  \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Trying to make a reassuring smile when you mouth was full of razor sharp teeth was difficult, but Hailey tried her best.  \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Caleb.\u201d Whimpering, he said, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Caleb, my name\u2019s Hailey.\u201d Grasping Caleb\u2019s hand, Hailey said, \u201cI\u2019m scared too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuttle had landed on the deck at the point; a door in the rear opened.  This was followed by a guttural voice coming over a hidden speaker that said, \u201cPlease disembark the shuttle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey and the others briefly hesitated as they were unsure what was going to happen to them once they left the shuttle.  When the message repeated a second time, Hailey and the others promptly exited the ship \u2013 only to find themselves in a large, dimly lit room.  Still holding Caleb\u2019s hand in hers, Hailey joined the other children as they were ushered into a single file line.  Looking down at Caleb, Hailey said, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, Caleb; I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looked up at Hailey, a look of fear in his eyes.  Moving to hug her, Caleb said, \u201cI want to go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to go home too, Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey\u2019s attention was brought back to the ship as she heard the large container being removed.  Her nostrils flared as she once again caught the scent of whatever was in the box.  Every one of the other children, Caleb included, had the same reaction; whatever was in the container was <i>really</i> appealing to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a nearby doorway opened and a large creature, different than the ones she\u2019s seen earlier, entered the room.  One of the first differences she saw was that it was wearing clothes; leading her to realize that she and the others had been naked the entire trip from the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature got closer, Hailey got a chance to get a good look at it.  Based on similarities to Caleb, Hailey figured the creature in front of them was an adult male.  That led her to realize that she was one of 3 females in the group.  The creature stopped in front of the kids and looked around, his nostrils flaring.  \u201cGreetings, younglings, my name is Axic.\u201d Looking at the group, he said, \u201cI want to assure you that there is no need to be frightened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let us go!\u201d a boy, around Hailey\u2019s age, said, \u201cWe want to go home!.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are home, youngling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur home is on Earth!\u201d Feeling defiant, Hailey said, \u201cPlease, I just want to go back home to my mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose insignificant creatures on the surface are no longer your families.\u201d Calmly, Axic said, \u201cWe will find your proper parents, and you will be raised as befits a young Creelaxian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey didn\u2019t like where this was going; she didn\u2019t want to be a part of whatever this Axic had in store for her and the others.  Before she react, a young girl next to her tried to run back towards the ship.  She didn\u2019t get far as two guards caught her and brought her back.  \u201cI\u2019m not a Creelaxian!\u201d trying to break free, the girl said, \u201cI\u2019ll never be one of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn time, youngling, you <i>will</i> be one of us.\u201d Looking at the girl, Axic said, \u201cIt\u2019s best not to fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later the group was ushered into a nearby, smaller room.  Axic handed a package to each of the kids, saying, \u201cPut these on, younglings; your parents are waiting for you in the next room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey ripped open her bag with ease; lamenting that her claws were good for something.  She found a pair of shorts and a shirt; which she reluctantly put on.  Once everyone was clothed, Axic led the group through a doorway into a room where a dozen Creelaxian adults were waiting.</span></div></div>",

Hailey was the last one to be called; as Axic walked up to her.  Looking at her, he said, \u201cYou are now Drayk, daughter of Evoque and Imkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the presentations complete, Axic left the room; leaving Hailey alone with her new \u2018parents.\u2019  The two of them walked over and the male said, \u201cHello Drayk, I\u2019m your father Evoque.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is not Drayk, its Hailey.\u201d Glaring at Evogue, she said, \u201cYou are not my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are Creelaxian now; who you were before doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Looking at her, Imkay said, \u201cI was once a member of another race; one far more advanced than the creatures of this world.  But even they were no match for the might of the Creel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can finish this conversation back in our chambers.\u201d Gesturing towards the door, Evoque said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for morning meal, and I\u2019m sure Qadeah is anxious to meet her sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey reluctantly followed Evoque and Imkay out of the room; finding herself inside a somewhat cramped passageway.  As she walked along, she was bombarded with all sorts of strange smells.  She saw quite of a few Creelaxians, of all ages and genders, as she went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing up several staircases, and going through a few passages, they finally stopped outside a closed door.  Evoque put a code in which caused the door to open; revealing a rather modest looking room, one that reminded Hailey of photos she\u2019d seen of her mom\u2019s first apartment.  <i>Mom.  I hope she\u2019s alright.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them walked inside as a younger Creelaxian female came out of another room.  As soon as she saw Hailey, she came running over.  \u201cIs this her?  Is this my sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Qadeah.\u201d Gesturing to Hailey, Imkay said, \u201cThis is your sister, Drayk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQadeah turned her attention to Hailey and reached out to hug her; causing Hailey to take a step back.  No matter what anyone said; these were not her parents, and she was definitely not her sister.  Qadeah gave Imkay a pained look, which prompted her to say, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Qadeah; give your sister time to adjust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvoque came out of a nearby room carrying a large platter with a cover on top of it.  \u201cIt is time for the morning meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs frightened as she was, Hailey had to admit that she was starving; and the smells coming from the platter were quite enticing.  She hesitantly took a seat next to Qadeah, only then realizing that there were no plates or utensils to be seen.  <i>Okay, that\u2019s weird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey watched as Evoque removed the lid from the platter; her eyes bugging out when she saw the platter contained severed human limbs.  If that wasn\u2019t enough for her to lose her appetite, she watched as the other three starting eating; chunks of bloody meat falling from their mouths.  <i>I have to get out here!\"</i></span></div></div>",

Turning around, she stared at him and said, \u201cJust keep David occupied.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, she said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t an ideal location to have a baby; I don\u2019t need him getting in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded and walked a little way down the road with David; leaving Margo alone with Madison in the back seat of the <br>\r\nSUV.  Looking at Margo, her face dripping with sweat, Madison said, \u201cEric\u2019s just *gasp* trying to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but right now he\u2019s pretty much useless.\u201d Looking at Madison, Margo said, \u201cWhen you feel your next contraction, I\u2019m going to need you to start pushing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a short way down the road, Eric and David were sitting on the guard rail.  Looking at David, who looked worried, Eric said, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be alright, David; Margo has everything under control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Eric caught a whiff of smoke coming from nearby.  Walking a short distance, getting closer to the smell, he looked down and saw a squad car in a ditch.  Turning to David, he said, \u201cDavid, buddy, I need you to stay right there.  I have to go check something; then I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded silently as Eric managed to make his way down into the ditch.  A closer look at the car showed it was totaled, but Eric figured there were still things he could use.  After a few minutes of searching; he came out with a shotgun with about a dozen shells and a bulletproof vest.  He was about to leave when he heard something from inside the cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer inspection, he realize the noise was in fact a voice coming over the scanner.  Turning up the volume, he heard. \u201c...8 survivors from the church on Maple; we\u2019re bringing them to the prison now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he needed to hear; he now had a potentially safe place to bring the group.  Climbing back up the hill, with his loot, he went back to where David was sitting.  Before he could say anything, he heard a baby\u2019s cry coming from the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as a cue that it was safe to return, Eric and David walked back to the car as Margo walked out from the back.  <br>\r\nSeeing them, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Eric walked around the back to check on Madison; seeing her holding her newborn son.  \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael.\u201d Looking up at Eric, Madison said, \u201cHis name\u2019s Michael.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that his father\u2019s name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d curtly, Madison said, \u201cIn fact, I don't think anyone in his father's family is named Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric let the matter drop, and turned to find Margo in the middle row checking on Olivia.  \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer breathing is better.\u201d Feeling Olivia\u2019s forehead, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure her fever\u2019s broken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric let out a sigh of relief; given everything going on, it was nice to have three positive outcomes in a row.  \u201cI found a squad car in a ditch up the road; heard something over the radio.\u201d Looking at Margo, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve set up an emergency shelter in the prison; which isn\u2019t too far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose a prison is better than being out in the open.\u201d pausing, Margo said, \u201cHow soon can you get us there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 15 minutes from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Margo walked around to get in the middle row with Olivia, she saw that a lock of Olivia\u2019s hair had come out in her hand.  She brushed it off her hand, then got into the car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it would turn out, Eric\u2019s estimate of 15 minutes was wrong; it ended up taking close to an hour before the group finally arrived at the prison.  That was due, in part, to the destruction they found along the way; down power lines, destroyed cars and even a missing bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat in the driver\u2019s seat as guards in the towers pointed weapons at them.  That sight was starting to unnerve David, as he started whimpering in the passenger seat.  Looking at David, Eric said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, buddy; they\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not a threat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before 3 prison guards walked out through a nearby door; two of them had their hands on their weapons while the third approached the car.  As Eric rolled down the window, the guard said, \u201cPlease identify yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Officer Eric Sheppard, Redford PD.\u201d Showing his badge, Eric said, \u201cPlease let us in; I have two young girls in need of immediate medical attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked through the windows of the SUV to verify Eric\u2019s story.  Eventually, he grabbed his radio and said, \u201cOpen the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for the gates to open sufficiently for the SUV to enter, but Eric was soon able to drive inside the compound.  Parking the car in the middle of the compound, Eric and the others stepped out.  Walking up to Eric, Margo said, \u201cI need to get Madison and Olivia to the infirmary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard who\u2019d let them in must\u2019ve overheard Margo; he came walking over and said, \u201cI\u2019ll escort you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Madison was able to walk, with some help, Olivia was still unconscious.  Eric was about to ask the guard to carry her when Margo picked her up from the car with ease.  He was about to ask her how she did that, but quickly figured it was adrenaline.  <br>\r\nOnce the others went off to the infirmary, David included, another prison guard approached Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told one of my men you\u2019re Redford PD, is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Chief is in the Warden\u2019s office; I imagine he\u2019d want to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric followed the guard into a nearby doorway, he said, \u201cWho\u2019s in charge right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s difficult to say; no one\u2019s heard from the Warden since he went home last night.\u201d Walking up a flight of stairs, the guard said, \u201cFor now, I believe your Chief is running the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard led Eric down the through the Administrative Wing until they came to a door marked \u2018Prison Warden.\u2019  The guard knocked on the door; which prompted a familiar voice to say, \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping to the side, the guard opened the door to let Eric into the room; where he found his boss, Chief of Police Michael Weston, standing behind the desk.  Walking over to the desk, Eric said, \u201cOfficer Sheppard, reporting as ordered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around, Eric expected Chief Weston to respond in a professional manner.  So you can imagine his surprise when his boss instead came around the table and hugged him.  \u201cGood to see you\u2019re still alive, son.\u201d Chuckling, Chief Weston said, \u201cI heard you were at the hospital with your sister; I feared the worst when I heard it had been attacked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir; someone dropped the ball during the evacuation, leaving myself, Olivia and three other people behind.\u201d Trying to control his anger, Eric said, \u201cI\u2019d very much like to meet the son of a bitch who authorized that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not condoning what happened, but you know what can happen in an intense situation like that.\u201d  Sitting down on the desk, <br>\r\nChief Weston said, \u201cNow tell me about Olivia; how is my god-daughter doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Weston was a long-time friend of Eric\u2019s father; the two of them serving in the Navy together in the late 80s.  He\u2019d looked after both Eric and Olivia after their parents died.  Taking a deep breath, Eric said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell, sir; the doctors said they\u2019ve never seen an infection like this.\u201d Sitting down in a chair, Eric said, \u201cMargo, one of the people in my group, was a pediatrics nurse at the hospital; she\u2019s been keeping tabs on Olivia\u2019s condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand you\u2019re probably anxious to check on your sister; so I won\u2019t keep you.\u201d Getting up, Chief Weston said, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll keep me informed of her condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the office, Eric met up with the guard who then brought him down to the infirmary.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Eric did when he reached the infirmary was to ask for Olivia.  The orderly, a young woman in her early 20s, pointed to a closed-door leading to an examination room.  \u201cShe\u2019s in there; being checked on by the doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a polite nod, Eric walked passed her and entered the room.  He found the doctor, a middle-aged man, checking Olivia\u2019s blood pressure.  Closing the door, he said, \u201cHow\u2019s she doing, doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s resting comfortably for the moment.\u201d Looking up, the doctor said, \u201cShe\u2019s displaying symptoms I\u2019ve never seen before, <br>\r\nbut I do believe she\u2019s out of danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s reaction to that news was to hug the older man.  After a moment, he broke the hug and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; i-it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologize, son; I\u2019d be worried if you <i>didn't</i> react that way.\u201d Grabbing what Eric figured was Olivia\u2019s chart, the doctor said, \u201cI believe your other friend is next door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked out of Olivia\u2019s room and went next door.  After knocking, he waited for a response.  \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room, Eric was mildly surprised to find Madison sitting in a chair breastfeeding.  He would have thought she\u2019d cover-up but to each their own.  Closing the door, he said, \u201cHow are you two doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d Looking at Eric, a smile on her face, Madison said, \u201cThank you for getting us here, Officer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, Madison.\u201d Smiling, Eric said, \u201cAnd, please, call me Eric; after what we\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s only right to be on a first-name basis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison finished breastfeeding and lay Michael inside one of those hospital bassinets.  Climbing into bed, Madison said, \u201cHow\u2019s Olivia doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor said she\u2019s doing fine.\u201d Sighing, Eric said, \u201cThank you for asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, figuring Madison needed some rest, Eric turned to leave.  Before he got to the door, Madison came over and hugged him.  As Eric returned the hug, Madison said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad I found <i>you</i> at the hospital, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down, Eric gave her a quick kiss on the forehead.  \u201cRight back at you, Madison; who knows what would\u2019ve happened had you not found me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the hug, Madison said, \u201cWith all the noise you were making, it wouldn\u2019t have taken long for those things to find you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the infirmary, the next thing Eric did was look for Margo and David.  It took him some time but, with the help of a prison guard, he found them sitting at a table inside an empty cell block.  Eric had overheard some of the guards saying most of the prisoners had escaped during the initial chaos.  <i>I wonder if they\u2019ll have us go after them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer, he noticed Margo gently rocking David in her arms as she sang a song to him.  Eric didn\u2019t recognize the song but figured that was because he didn\u2019t follow children\u2019s music. Taking a seat next to her, Eric said, \u201cThank you, Margo; you saved my sister\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, Eric.\u201d Looking at him, Margo said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d react; for all I knew, I was treading on hot water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric knew he must be tired; there was no way she'd just said that.  Looking at Margo, he said, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re singing lullabies; do you mind if I catch up on my sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Margo could respond, two guards entered the cellblock and walked right up to Margo.  \u201cMa\u2019am, you need to come with us.\u201d Showing a pair of handcuffs, one of them said, \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wasn\u2019t so tired that he couldn't snap to attention as soon as he heard this.  Walking up to the guards, he said, \u201cOn what charges?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW received a report from a security guard at the hospital.\u201d Putting the cuffs on Margo, the guard said, \u201cShe kidnapped a child from the Pediatrics Wing.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Despite barely knowing her, Eric had a difficult time believing that Margo was capable of what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group entered the holding area, a small hallway with three holding rooms.  Putting David in one of the seats, Eric looked at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to find out what\u2019s going on, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up one of the guards, as they walked out of the room, Eric said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to her now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she did kidnap the boy, she\u2019ll likely face some jail time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go talk to her.\u201d sighing, Eric looked at the guard and said, \u201cMaybe this is all just a big misunderstanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Chief doesn\u2019t want anyone...Hey!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took that opportunity to run into the holding room and close the door.

He wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt after everything they\u2019ve been through; but he was beginning to realize he really didn\u2019t know anything about her.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll go as badly as you think it will.\u201d Looking at her, Eric said, \u201cTry it out on me; how did you know that David would be in danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, if you really want to know.\u201d Sighing, Margo leaned over the table and said, \u201cI knew David was in danger because I\u2019ve seen firsthand what the Creel are capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was starting to get confused; wondering who the Creel were, and starting to have doubts about the woman sitting in front of him.  Looking at Margo said, \u201cHow could you possibly know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not what I appear to be, Eric; I\u2019m a nurse, but I\u2019m also much more than that.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m a Maltorian; and 15 years ago, long before they knew about your world, the Creel nearly drove my species to extinction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Eric was stunned would be an understatement; he simply couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d just heard was true.  Looking at Margo, he said, \u201cOkay...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back in the chair, Margo looked at Eric and said, \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric spent the next two hours sitting outside the holding room while Chief Weston, and the prison interrogator, questioned Margo.

Walking over to the door, Eric saw a few things on the table he couldn\u2019t identify.  He watched as the interrogator, whose name he didn\u2019t get, went over to un-cuff Margo.  \u201cYou\u2019ll understand if we ask that you keep your true identity secret from the general population.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI completely understand; there\u2019s no need to cause any more panic.\u201d  Turning to Chief Weston, Margo said, \u201cForgive me for not fully understanding the judicial system of this planet, but can I assume that I\u2019m free to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d Gesturing out the door, Chief Weston said, \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t try to kidnap any more children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Chief Weston\u2019s comment, Margo gathered her things and put them in her bag.

Carefully gathering Michael in her arms, she walked next door to Olivia\u2019s room.  Walking into the room, Madison stopped in her tracks when she realized what she was looking at.  Olivia\u2019s hair was lying on her pillow in clumps like a halo; and, while she was breathing fine, Olivia\u2019s skin was taking on a blue tint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was about to get a doctor to look at her when Olivia opened her eyes.  \u201cHello?\u201d seeing Michael asleep in Madison\u2019s arms, she said, \u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d momentarily confused, Madison said, \u201cOh, this little guy is mine; I\u2019m Madison Decker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlivia Sheppard.\u201d Looking around, Olivia said, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had to move a few hours ago; we\u2019re at the prison now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d With a perplexed look on her face, Olivia said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the story with the little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was dating this guy at school; we were getting pretty serious until I found out I was pregnant.\u201d Sighing, Madison said, \u201cThe jackass dumped me the second I told him.  What about you?  What\u2019s your story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was dating this older guy, and I was just starting to realize that he wasn\u2019t good for me.\u201d Lying back in bed, Olivia said, \u201cLast night he went straight to kidnapping me with the intent to rape.  Then he turned into a literal monster and bit me, so I shot him in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison had to admit that Olivia\u2019s story was worse than hers.  Looking at her, chuckling, Madison said, \u201cOkay, I guess you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I remember was the doctors saying I had a really nasty infection.  I guess it\u2019s clearing up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Pausing, Madison said, \u201dDid your infection do <i>that</i> to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo <i>what</i> to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting Michael so she could hold him with one hand, Madison took her compact out of her bag.  When Olivia went to grab it, both girls saw that the little finger on her hand was curled up; and it resisted Olivia\u2019s efforts to straighten it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, Olivia saw her hair and her skin.  Her screams woke up Michael. She didn't care.</span></div></div>",

Out of breath, the guard looked at Eric and said, \u201cAre you Eric Sheppard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Concerned, Eric said, \u201cWhose asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re needed in the infirmary.\u201d Pausing, the guard said, \u201cThere\u2019s been a development with your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo and Eric took off running before the guard had finished his sentence.  The two of them ran into the infirmary to find Madison standing outside Olivia\u2019s room, trying in vain to calm Michael down.  Seeing Eric and Margo, she said, \u201cSo-Something\u2019s wrong with Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric followed Margo inside the room to find a couple of orderlies struggling to sedate Olivia.  They finally succeeded after a few attempts, leaving her to lie groggily on the bed.  It was only then that Eric could see what was happening to Olivia \u2013 and it was something he couldn\u2019t explain.  Casting a glance at Margo, seeing the horrified look on her face, he thought \u2013 <i>maybe she knows what\u2019s going on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor walked into the room, not surprised to find Eric already there.  As soon as he closed the door, Eric said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to my sister, doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest idea, son.\u201d Taking a tablet from the counter, he said, \u201cI took a blood sample to compare it one I took when Olivia arrived; it came back with some unusual results.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo and Eric came around to look at the tablet; seeing two side by side images on the screen.  Eric didn\u2019t have any medical experience, so he didn\u2019t know what he was looking at, but he knew enough to realize something was definitely different with the two samples.  For starters, the newer sample seemed to contain a number of larger looking cells.  Looking at the doctor, Eric said, \u201cCould that be the source of Olivia\u2019s infection?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to fathom a guess.\u201d Sighing, turning off the tablet, the doctor said, \u201cEven if they were the source, I\u2019ve never heard of an infection that could do this to a person; I mean, almost 40% of her skin is blue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor stayed for a few minutes before leaving to handle another situation.  Closing the door behind once he\u2019d left, Eric turned to Margo and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with my sister, Margo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Eric, I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop lying to me!\u201d slamming his hands on the counter, Eric said, \u201cI saw the way you looked at the images, you know what\u2019s happening to my sister and I want to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine; I have an idea of what\u2019s happening to Olivia.\u201d  Sighing, Margo said, \u201cThose cells from her blood sample; they\u2019re Maltorian white blood cells.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are Maltorian blood cells doing inside Olivia\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe antibiotics I gave her in the car.\u201d Taking a breath, Margo said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t developed here on Earth; they were developed on my homeworld.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn\u2019t believe that Margo had given Olivia medicine developed by her people.  Looking at her, he said, \u201cYou gave Olivia alien medicine; without knowing what it would do to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI started to have my suspicions after Madison gave birth.\u201d Gesturing to Olivia, who was asleep in the bed, Margo said, \u201cBut seeing those test results confirmed that my suspicions were correct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat suspicions?\u201d getting worried, Eric looked at Margo and said, \u201cMargo, what\u2019s happening to my sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s becoming Maltorian.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Whatever changes were happening to Olivia seemed to be progressing; as her skin was now more than 60% blue.  Looking at Margo, confused, Eric said, \u201cThey pumped her full of sedatives; how can she possibly be awake, let alone on her feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer Maltorian physiology must be asserting itself,\u201d Turning to Eric, Margo said, \u201cMaltorians have a heightened resistance to foreign substances.  Apparently the sedatives that were used weren\u2019t strong enough for a Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Eric and Margo, more confused than ever, Olivia said, \u201cWould someone please tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo spent the next 30 minutes explaining everything to Olivia; from being born on another planet to her mission on Earth.  When it came time to explain what was happening to her, Margo said, \u201cIf I\u2019d known <i>this</i> would happen, I would\u2019ve kept using Terran medicine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed, looking at her changed appearance, Olivia looked up at Margo.  \u201cSo let me get this straight; you\u2019re a Maltorian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; I was born on a world 20 light-years from here.\u201d Leaning against the wall, Margo said, \u201cI only look human for the purpose of my mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her left arm, which was now almost completely blue, Olivia said, \u201cThe stuff you gave me; it\u2019s turning me into a member of your species?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cUnfortunately, with the technology present, there\u2019s no way I can stop the changes.\u201d<br>\r\nAs Margo dug through her bag, Olivia said, \u201cHow long do I have before I\u2019m...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding what she was looking for, a small rectangular device, Margo said, \u201cI won\u2019t know that answer until I can run a scan.\u201d <br>\r\nRunning it over Eric\u2019s body, Margo showed the readout to both Olivia and him.  \u201cThe scan shows that Eric\u2019s DNA is 100% human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m almost afraid to ask what it will say about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric took Olivia\u2019s hand in his, Margo ran the device over her body.  Once the scan was finished, Margo looked at the readout and sighed.  \u201cIt appears Olivia is now 55% Maltorian and 45% Terran.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat news was enough to cause Olivia to pass out again; leaving Eric and Margo to stare at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, aboard the Creel vessel, Hailey was struggling to resist the Creel's attempts to indoctrinate her.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d begun resorting to reminding herself of her name, her mother\u2019s name and the lullaby she\u2019d sing to Hailey whenever she got sick.  But not everything she did was working; more than once, when trying to sing the song to herself, Hailey found that she forgetting the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill refusing to call them her parents, Hailey had told Evoque and Imkay that she needed to be alone for a while.  Despite not knowing her way around the ship, she eventually found herself in a large room with a window overlooking Earth; the sight of which made her pine for a return to her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at a table overlooking the window, trying to ignore the plethora of foreign smells when she noticed four Creel entering the room.  Looking at them, she recognized the two young Creel as Caleb and the girl who\u2019d tried to make a run for it.  Putting two and two together, she realized the adults were their \u2018parents.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb noticed her and walked over; as the two adults sat nearby with the girl.  Sitting down, Caleb looked at her and said, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could continue talking, they were interrupted when the girl yelled, \u201cMy name is Rachel!\u201d making a fist with her clawed hand, the girl said, \u201cCall me <i>that</i> or don\u2019t call me anything at all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey realized Rachel, for whatever reason, was having better luck resisting then she was.  Turning to Caleb, she said, \u201cI see Rachel\u2019s doing her best to resist; what are you doing to remind yourself that you're human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I need to remind myself that I\u2019m human?\u201d looking at her strangely, Caleb said, \u201cI\u2019m Creel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey tried her best to hide her shock; just a few hours earlier, Caleb had been begging to go home.  Now it appeared as though he\u2019d given into the Creel.  Before she could say anything, they were interrupted by the a Creel woman\u2019s voice.  \u201cThere you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey looked up to find the two Creel adults standing over them; looking behind them, she saw Rachel sitting at a nearby table.  Looking at Caleb, the female said, \u201cAre you and your friend enjoying yourselves, Nirav?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb, now going by the name Nirav, looked up at the female.  \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s human, mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey could practically hear the shock in Nirav\u2019s voice; as though it was the most ridiculous thing he\u2019d ever heard.  Looking at them, the male said, \u201cShe will come around, eventually; as will your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve brought you a special treat, my youngling.\u201d Digging into a bag on her side, the female said, \u201cFresh quinnum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey watched as she handed Nirav a rat-like creature; one that was still alive.  Hailey watched, horrified, as Nirav promptly bit its head off.  She then proceeded to leave the room so she could throw up in private.</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t have to wait long; for the door opened to reveal Qadeah standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on her face, or rather something resembling a smile.  Looking at Hailey, she said, \u201cDrayk! We\u2019re about to play a game of dryads, come join us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey didn\u2019t know what kind of game dryads was, and she didn\u2019t really care, but she saw Evoque and Imkay holding what looked like cards in their hands.  As the door closed behind her, Hailey said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little tired; would it be alright if I lay down before evening meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Drayk.\u201d Looking at her, Imkay said, \u201cWould you like me to wake you for evening meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey didn\u2019t even care that Imkay was calling her Drayk.

All of her friends were there to celebrate her big day; cheering as she blew all the candles out in one breath.  The girl next to her, whose name she couldn\u2019t remember, asked, \u201cWhat did you wish for Hailey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey didn\u2019t answer; instead, she opened her mouth and ripped out the girl\u2019s throat with her teeth.  Blood dripped from her mouth as the others started screaming in horror.  A few of them tried to stop her, but Hailey found her claws were just as deadly as her fangs.  Less than two minutes passed before she\u2019d killed them all.  <i>Pathetic humans; are they good for anything?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her reflection in the fridge, she saw her former human reflection with her new Creel reflection \u2013 a chunk of meat hanging out of her mouth.  <i>Well</i>, she acknowledged, <i>they're good for one thing</i>, as she began to devour them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey bolted upright in bed; still tasting the flesh of her friends and the sheer joy she\u2019d felt s slaughtering them. \"No,\" she whispered to herself, \"please, no....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHailey cried herself to sleep.

As Overseer, he was responsible for the supervision of observation teams on inhabited worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking onto the command deck, he overheard distant conversations about the progress of resupplying the ship.  The Colony Ship, home to 2000 Maltorians, had arrived in the system two weeks earlier to resupply.  He thought they had another week to go before the resupply was finished, so he was confused as to why he heard the last of the ships was returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorza walked up to a viewport overlooking the bow of the ship; stopping behind an older man.  \u201cCouncilor, Overseer Trogrik reporting as requested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouncilor J'Sepp Uavoo was the head of the Maltorian Ruling Council; effectively making him the commander of the ship.  Turning around to face Borza, he said, \u201cOverseer Trogrik; when was the last time you received an update for Observation Team 7 \u2013 the ones sent to observe the Terrans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout two weeks ago, sir.\u201d Growing concerned, Borza said, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have received a distress call from a member of the team, your niece Sorain Kekeva.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorza\u2019s heart skipped a beat at the thought his niece was in danger.  Looking at Councilor Uavoo, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the nature of the distress call, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems the Creel have invaded that world.\u201d Seeing the horrified look on Borza\u2019s face, Councilor Uavoo said, \u201cWe\u2019ve begun departure preparations; we should arrive in orbit in 13 hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorza excused himself and left the command check; not wanting the Councilor to see him panicking.  As he got into a nearby lift, he said to himself, \u201cHang on, Sorain; we\u2019re coming for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Against her better judgment, Eric had convinced her to bring the prison doctor in on what was happening.  He took the news surprisingly well; although the preponderance of evidence certainly helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point Olivia\u2019s appearance becoming less human by the minute; her little fingers and little toes were all gone, her skin was completely blue and Eric could swear that her skull was getting longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was understandably having trouble dealing with everything; as she\u2019d spent the last 15 minutes looking at her reflection in a mirror.  Bringing a hand up to her face, Olivia said, \u201cHad I not seen Kyle turn into that creature, I wouldn\u2019t have believed anything like this was possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still having trouble; it\u2019s not every day your little sister turns into a blue alien.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not still angry with Margo, are you?\u201d putting the mirror down, Olivia looked at Eric and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like she knew anything like this was going to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe treated you with alien medicine, O.\u201d sighing, Eric said, \u201cEven if she didn\u2019t know this would happen, she had to know the risks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I understand you feel the need to be angry with her.\u201d Taking a breath, Olivia said, \u201cBut right now I need her support; she\u2019s the only one here who knows what it\u2019s like to be Maltorian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric started to realize Olivia was right; Margo was the only one in the prison who had an understanding of what she was dealing with.  Before he could say anything, the door opened as Margo and the Doctor walked inside.  As they closed the door, Eric saw they had discouraged looks on their faces.  \u201cI\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t have good news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no.\u201d looking at us, the Doctor said, \u201cThe good news is Olivia\u2019s condition is stable; the bad news is, we have no way of <br>\r\nreversing the changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them, Olivia said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBased on my scans, I suspect you\u2019ll be 100% Maltorian by tomorrow morning.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of any remaining Terran DNA in your system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric went to hold Olivia\u2019s hand as she processed the information she\u2019d just been given.  Turning to look at Eric, she was about to say something when the door opened again.  Before anyone could stop her, Madison walked in carrying a tray of food.  \u201cHey, I thought perhaps Oli...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose inside the room could only watch as Madison dropped the tray of food when she saw Olivia\u2019s new look.</span></div></div>",

The only thing she was certain of was that she was in grave danger.  Ever since the creatures had transformed the little girl and took her away, they\u2019d returned at regular intervals to remove someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same chain of events happened each time; the creatures would come in, the people would scream and they were never seen or heard from again.  That had continued until there were only four people, including her, left in the cell \u2013 having started with 18 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the few remaining people happened to be the mother of the girl who\u2019d been taken.  She had been in a catatonic state since that happened; lying on the floor in the fetal position.  Liz couldn\u2019t really blame her; she\u2019d probably react the same way in her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and the others alternated looking after her; it was currently Liz\u2019s turn.  She had no idea what to say to the woman, whose name she never learned, so she resorted to gently caressing her body.  Suddenly she was startled by a nearby sound.  She looked over to find another cellmate, a man in his 40s, holding a pipe in his hands.  Looking at him, he said, \u201cWhat are you planning to do with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to escape; I have no intention of being taken away by those...things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, sir.\u201d Sighing, Liz said, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do anything to anger these things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d pointing to the catatonic mother, the man said, \u201cEspecially after we all saw what they did to her little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are only 3 of us in any condition to do anything; god knows how many of those things are out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to make a break for it the next time they come in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentlemen didn\u2019t have very long to wait; as a creature entered the room a short time later.  Entering the cell, it went to grab a young man in his late teens.  Liz found herself paralyzed by fear as the creature pulled the young man towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eyes, she saw the older man prepare to make his move.  She watched as he slowly snuck up behind the creature.  He was about to strike it in the head with the pipe when, to her surprise, Liz yelled out, \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the young man, the creature spun around and grabbed the older man by the throat.  He dropped the pipe as the creature carried both of them towards the cage; the older man staring at Liz in anger, \u201cI hope you rot in hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz could only watch as the creature closed the gate and dragged the two men out of the room; hearing their screams recede into the distance.  Moving backward, towards the wall, Liz started crying; fearing she\u2019d never leave this place alive.</span></div></div>",

After getting dressed, he decided to go check on Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked into the infirmary, a few minutes later, to find the door to Madison\u2019s room open.  He took a quick peek inside and found both her and David asleep in the bed.  Seeing that, it only served to change his opinion of Madison.  Far from being a stubborn, self-centered teenager; Eric was starting to realize that Madison was incredibly mature for her age.  Eric wasn\u2019t condoning teen pregnancy, but he felt Madison was going to be a great mother to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, Eric went next door to Olivia\u2019s room; walking inside to find Olivia and Margo both fast asleep.  Olivia\u2019s changes had started to slow down; Eric noticed that her skull had finished changing, now close to resembling the crystal skulls he\u2019d learn about in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Margo, he gently nudged her until she woke up.  Looking up at Eric, she said, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about 5:15 in the morning.\u201d Sighing, Eric said, \u201cYou feel like getting a bite to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Getting up, Margo said, \u201cI was up most of the night talking with Olivia; she had a lot of questions about Maltorians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she\u2019s Maltorian now, it makes sense that she\u2019d want to know about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Margo talked during their walk to the cafeteria; during which time they noticed Margo was getting a fair amount of dirty looks.  Looking at Margo, Eric said, \u201cWhy are people staring at you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering that myself.\u201d Stopping, Margo turned to Eric and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think my secret got out, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something Eric was wondering as well, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to think it was the case.  \u201cI doubt it; both Chief Weston and the interrogator promised to keep that a secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d Pausing, Margo said, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen enough Terran movies to know your species generally doesn\u2019t respond well to aliens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re getting ahead of yourself, Margo.\u201d Trying to sound reassuring, Eric said, \u201cAs far as everyone\u2019s concerned, you\u2019re a human woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had arrived at the cafeteria by that point; walking inside to find some inmates, under guard, eating in the corner.  Eric also saw a few civilian survivors eating nearby.  A few prisoners stopped what they were doing when they saw Margo standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were too far away to hear what they were saying, but Eric and Margo could see that they talking to each other.  Eric was starting to get an uneasy feeling as they walked past the group on the way to the kitchen.  Before either of them could respond, a large tattooed man stepped in front of them.  \u201cWe heard about what you did to that girl, freak.\u201d Shoving Margo into a nearby pole, the prisoner said, \u201cWe won\u2019t let you do the same to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Eric wanted to see Margo beat the crap out of the man, Eric knew that would cause a problem.  Going over, he tried to separate them.  \u201cLet go of her, right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more inmates got up when they saw Eric grabbing their friend.  Thinking he was protected, the man said, \u201cWhy are you even protecting her?\u201d scoffing, glaring at Margo, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s not even really human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo was shocked to hear that last bit.  Looking at the prisoner, she said, \u201cWho told you that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over the joint, freak; how you turned one of <i>us</i> into one of <i>you</i>.\u201d Smirking, the man said, \u201cIs that how you get your kicks on your world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight, pal.\u201d Grabbing the man by the collar, Eric said, \u201cMy sister is not, never was, and never will be one of <i>you</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing his grip on Margo, the man turned to Eric and said, \u201cYou better let go of me, cop, if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore Eric could react, Margo grabbed the man and shoved him into the pillar; causing the pillar to crack in a few places.  \u201cLay a hand on him again, and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving focused all her attention on the main prisoner, Margo hadn\u2019t noticed another prisoner come up behind her.  Eric noticed he was carrying a shiv; but before he could react, he jabbed it into Margo\u2019s side.</span></div></div>",

Before the guards could enter the fracas, he looked at them and said, \u201cWait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough it became clear that the mob was thinning; until only Margo was left standing in the middle of the cafeteria.  Eric was surprised that she was barely breaking a sweat, and the stab wound seemed to be her only serious injury \u2013 and that was beginning to clot over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMargo, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Eric, Margo dug through the pile of stunned assailants until she found the man who\u2019d accosted her.  \u201cMy people have a word for those who fight like you and your friends.\" She pulled him closer to her face. \"I believe the closest word in your language is 'noobs.'

As they walked through the hall, Eric looked at Margo and said, \u201cAre you alright?  That wound looked pretty bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine; just going to be sore for a while.\u201d Wincing, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019m just thankful Maltorians only have one kidney; otherwise I would be in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened; I\u2019m certain Chief Weston will make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t share your optimism, Eric.\u201d Walking up some stairs, Margo said, \u201cI\u2019ve read enough of your history to know your species has a knack for discriminating against those they feel are different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them arrived in the yard just as Chief Weston and some prison guards arrived to cordon off the area.  Apparently word of Margo\u2019s secret had spread further than anticipated, as some civilians began pointing and yelling at her.  As they walked up to Chief Weston, he took one look at Margo and said, \u201cI heard what happened; I assure you it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Chief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point the guards had cordoned off a large area around the ship; Eric stood by while Margo walked up to the back of the ship.  It wasn\u2019t long before the back door opened and two Maltorians walked out.  Eric suspected Margo must\u2019ve known one of them because she walked over and hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter conversing for a few seconds, Margo walked over with the two Maltorians.  \u201cEric Sheppard.  Chief Weston.  Allow me to introduce Borza Trogrik and Phiemu Crican.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Weston and Eric shook the hands of both men.  Once that was finished, Borza turned to Eric and said, \u201cMy niece has informed me of the situation regarding your sister.  With your permission, I would like to see her now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was soon escorted into the prison; as Eric stayed back to speak with Margo.  \u201cBorza\u2019s your uncle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; he\u2019s my mother\u2019s older brother.\u201d With a sad look on her face, Margo said, \u201cHe took me in after the Creel attacked my world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric made a note to ask Margo, at some point, to tell him what happened to her world.  Walking down the hall, Eric said, \u201cWhat exactly can do for Olivia that you haven\u2019t already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hoping they can reverse the changes done to her, that\u2019s not very likely.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cThe most they can do is offer to bring her up to the Colony Ship; to ensure that she\u2019s healthy and not experiencing any side effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group arrived at the infirmary a few minutes later; walking inside to find Madison pacing around the room trying to get Michael to stop crying.  Eric had to give her credit for not freaking out at the sight of Borza and Phiemu.  As Eric walked by, he looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe noise outside woke him up.\u201d Trying to rock Michael, Madison leaned over and said, \u201cAre they here to help Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking Madison to go back into her room, Eric walked over to where Borza and the others were speaking with the Doctor.  Eric had completely forgotten that Chief Weston didn\u2019t know what had happened with Olivia.  That became apparent when he said, \u201cI was told it was a simple bacterial infection; what kind of side effects are we talking about here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith Eric\u2019s permission, I think it would be easier to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod from Eric, the Doctor opened the door to let everyone inside the room.  Olivia was lying awake in bed.  Chief Weston took one look at Olivia and turned to Eric.  \u201cIs this some kind of joke?\u201d incredulous, he said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Olivia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here, Uncle Michael.\u201d Getting out of bed, Olivia said, \u201cI know I don\u2019t look the same as I used to, but it\u2019s really me.\u201d<br>\r\nSo began a long conversation where everything was explained to Chief Weston.  When the explanation ended, annoyed, he turned to Eric and said, \u201cWhy would you keep something like this from me, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive us, sir; but we didn\u2019t know what was happening until after we got here.\u201d Pausing, Eric said, \u201cWe would have told you sooner, but you were too busy running the prison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve have found the time to tell me, Eric.\u201d Gesturing to Olivia, Chief Weston said, \u201cShe\u2019s my god-daughter for god\u2019s sake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s my sister, sir; and I\u2019ll do anything to keep her safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to Borza, who had been conferring with Margo in the corner, Chief Weston said, \u201cI assume there\u2019s nothing you can do to reverse these changes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not; especially after what my niece has told me.\u201d Turning his attention to Olivia, Borza said, \u201cWith your permission, <br>\r\nOlivia, we would like to bring you up to our ship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting nervous, Olivia said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey just want to make sure you\u2019re healthy, O.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings moved quickly after that; as Chief Weston left to clear a path from the infirmary to the ship.  The Doctor came back into the room with a hazmat suit.  Handing it to Olivia, he said, \u201cPut this on, young lady; that way no one can see what you look like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left the room as Olivia got changed.  While they waited, Borza came over to Eric and Margo, \u201cI\u2019ll be flying back to the ship with you; Phiemu will stay here to brief your leader about the Creel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison came back out of her room at that point.  Seeing the activity in the infirmary, she looked at Eric and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Maltorians are going to take Olivia up to their ship; to make sure she\u2019s healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Olivia walked out of her room in full hazmat gear.  Madison walked past Eric and went over to hug Olivia.  \u201cStay safe, Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Madison.\u201d Hugging her back, Olivia said, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d </span></div></div>",

That didn\u2019t stop a few of them from yelling obscenities at them.  Eric realized this was the last thing that Olivia needed right now.<br>\r\nAs the group walked through the makeshift barrier put in place by Chief Weston, Borza said to Eric, \u201cI\u2019ve informed my pilot that we\u2019re to take off as soon as everyone is aboard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for doing this, sir.\u201d Sighing, Eric said, \u201cOlivia\u2019s the only family I have left in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, Eric Sheppard.\u201d Gesturing to Margo, who was walking ahead of them, Borza said, \u201cSorain...I mean Margo, is the only other member of my family to survive the Creel invasion of my world.  I would do anything to keep her safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group stopped at the back hatch of the shuttle; waiting as it lowered to the ground.  Once it was lowered, the group quickly boarded the shuttle before it started to close again.  While Borza went to ensure the hatch was secure, Olivia and Eric went to take a seat along the far wall.  Margo was about to join them when a Maltorian female came out of the cockpit.  Focusing on Borza, she said, \u201cThe engines are warmed up, and Command knows...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female stopped speaking the moment she saw Margo standing in front of her.  Likewise, Margo stopped what she\u2019d been doing as well.  From the looks they were giving each other, Eric figured the two must\u2019ve known each other.  He didn\u2019t know how well until Margo walked over and gave the woman a passionate kiss on the lips.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Margo looked at Dhelo and said, \u201cI was sent here to understand these people, Dhelo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing, Dhelo said, \u201cI understand my ship pretty well, and I never thought about sleeping with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it became clear that Dhelo and Margo had some unfinished business, Eric was relieved when Borza stepped forward. \u201cDhelo, you can finish your reunion later.\u201d Sighing, he said, \u201cWe only have a brief window to sneak past the Creel vessel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry sir.\u201d Exchanging a look with Margo, Dhelo said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be airborne momentarily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Borza joined Dhelo in the cockpit, Margo joined Olivia and Eric in the back.

Margo wasn\u2019t kidding; the whole ship shook a little as we gained altitude. Turning to Margo, Eric said, \u201cDhelo kept calling you Sorain.  Is that your real name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Nodding, Margo said, \u201cMy real name is Sorain Kekeva; but if you can continue calling me Margo if you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few bumpy moments, Olivia looked at Margo and said, \u201cSo Dhelo seems nice.\u201d Chuckling, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not really into girls; but for a blue alien, she\u2019s pretty attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Smiling, Margo said, \u201cWe met when I was 16; we were in the same training group.  One thing led to another; and we started dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said she was your ex-girlfriend.\u201d Curious, Eric said, \u201cWhat happened to break you guys up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing that tends to end Terran relationships; our careers got in the way.\u201d Sighing, Margo said, \u201cShe was training to be a combat pilot, and I\u2019d just ended my apprenticeship with the Observer Corp.  We started fighting a lot; until she decided to end things with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could tell that Margo was still hurt by what happened.  Looking at her, he said, \u201cPerhaps you weren\u2019t meant to be together.\u201d Pausing, Eric said, \u201cMaybe there\u2019s someone else out there for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you mention that.\u201d Chuckling, Margo said, \u201cThe woman I went on the date with, Liz; I connected with her in a way I\u2019d never had with Dhelo.  If it hadn\u2019t been for the Creel invasion, I definitely would have asked for a second date.  Now \u2013 I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia, in an attempt to change the subject, said, \u201cCan you tell me what I can expect once we reach your ship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be brought for a medical exam, to ensure there are no complications.\u201d Looking at Olivia, Margo said, \u201cUntil now, I never thought such a thing was possible; so they'll want to make sure you're healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill I be able to return to the prison once they\u2019re done with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Olivia; I\u2019m sure the Governing Council will want to weigh in on the situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric could see that Olivia was starting to get worried.  Taking her hand in his, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, O; we\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia leaned over and rested her head on Eric\u2019s shoulder.  With a sigh, she said, \u201cThanks, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the cabin was filled with Dhelo\u2019s voice coming over an intercom. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching the Mothership.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo was the first to stand up and walk towards the cockpit; although Eric couldn\u2019t really blame her.  After all, it had been over a year since she\u2019d seen her home.  Olivia and Eric followed behind her; walking into the cockpit just as the ship came into view <br>\r\nahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship, like nothing Olivia or Eric had ever seen before, was in a low orbit on the far side of the moon. Eric was immediately reminded of the line from Contact - <i>They should have sent a poet</i>.  Eric and Olivia were speechless as they watched the ship get larger in the window.  The ship had to be at least 25 miles across and shaped almost like a manta-ray.  Looking at Margo, in awe, Olivia said, \u201cDoes your...I mean <i>our</i> entire species live on that ship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Olivia; all 1500 of us.\u201d Moving to the side, to allow for a better view, Margo said, \u201cI must say, it\u2019s good to be home again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Olivia stood in the rear of the cockpit while Dhelo piloted the s the shuttle towards the raised section in the middle of the hull.

While she lay in bed, a team of medical professionals examined her, with not even her temperature being read by invasive means. When they were finished, the leader of the team said to Olivia, \"All tests show the results we would expect of a Maltorian of your age, Olivia. There is nothing to indicate that you were born Terran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens now?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we recommend rest.

Entering it, the Maltorian pressed a button with alien writing on it, and the elevator moved, first vertically, then horizontally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lift came to a stop, it opened onto a large open area at the front of the ship. Eric saw alien trees and plants, as well as a number of ponds. The windows offered a spectacular view of both Earth and the moon. Spotting a bench, Eric said to the Maltorian, \"Thank you for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric made his way to the bench, glad to see that there was nobody else in the promenade. He wanted solitude.</span></div></div>",

She then smiled at Margo. \"Come on, let's go check it out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?!\" Taken back, Margo demanded. \"It's likely going to be super hot and more than likely left a huge hole in the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say we were going to touch it, scaredy-cat.\" Grinning, Liz said. \"Come one, it'll be more fun than any movie we can go see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Margo followed Liz about a hundred yards to the crash sight where they found a sizeable hole about the size of a football stadium.
