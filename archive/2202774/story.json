Putting on an open vest, sweatpants, and some boots, he went to work.  He flicked through the multiverse like it was a cell phone, deciding on a world that was almost completely canon, save for one or two extremely minor decisions that allowed it to deviate from the Prime reality.  He decended down into the world, landing in the middle of Nerima.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the middle of a battle, apparently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Get back here with those panties, ya pervert!\" screamed a voice.  The villain looked, and smiled when he saw Ranma Saotome, in girl form, chasing Happosai around, the latter carrying a bag of underwear.  Not far behind Ranma, in a rare show of unity, was Akane Tendo, Ukyo Kuonji, the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, and Kodachi Kuno, all of them blushing and visibly furious with the little pervert.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain took the time to admire each lady.  Ranma herself was gorgeous, and up close he could see what Tatewaki Kuno always called her a tigress.  Her muscular body moved like flowing as she leaped around after Happosai.  Plus, her breasts were wonderful, bouncing free of a bra as she ran after the old pervert.  Akane wasn't as graceful as the others, but she had a stout strength, with amazing abs.  Shampoo was as buxom as Ranma, with an ample posterior as well.  Ukyo was looking more buxom than usual, the villain realizing, to his delight, that she bound her breasts.  And Kodachi, despite her laugh, had a curvy gymnast's body, fluid and gorgeous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked forward to breeding all five women.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe started out simply, reaching out with his powers and deleting Ranma's male form from existence, as well as her curse.  Everyone would remember that she had been male, but there would be no way to change her back under any circumstances.  Just to be safe, he gave her an immunity to Jusenkyo curses.  Which is when things got amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow, to retain one's humanity while being overpowered as fuck, one has to make some sacrifices.  Such as suppressing cosmic awareness which might make you too existential to appreciate physical pleasures.  Which is why, while distracted by Ranma, he didn't notice Happosai leaping towards him and bouncing off of his face.  Which is when Akane's thrown hammer and Shampoo's thrown bonbori mace struck him in the face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe wasn't hurt, obviously.  But it was surprising enough that he fell over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Aiyah!\" Shampoo cried out in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"CIVILIAN DOWN!\" Ukyo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damned old pervert!  GET BACK HERE AND APOLOGIZE TO THIS GUY!\" Ranma shouted, running off as the other girls came up to him to check on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You okay, sir?\" Akane asked, looking ashamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fine, fine,\" the villain said.  He grinned up at them, a dazzling, perfect smile to go with his muscular body and silvery, shoulder-length, deliberately Sephiroth-esque hair.  (He didn't care how silly it looked.  He was going villain so he was allowed to make eccentric fashion decisions.)  To his satisfaction, all four women blushed at his bare chest.  \"I'm more surprised than anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shirtless man must be martial artist to take hit like that and just be 'surprised,'\" Shampoo said, smiling.  The Amazon found herself wanting to nuzzle up against the villain's abs and was cursing what she felt was a betrayal of Ranma's love.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I've dabbled,\" the villain said.  He reached into their minds with his powers and increased their attraction towards him.  \"Mainly to keep in shape.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Keep in VERY good shape,\" Ukyo said.  She was feeling flustered by this handsome man and wasn't sure why.  It was Ranma she wanted... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKodachi, squirming to hide her arousal and wishing she wore something more covering than a leotard, smiled charmingly.  \"You are a gentleman, sir, to excuse these ill-born brutes for their actions,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShampoo and Akane glared at Kodachi, who ignored them.  The villain tsked.  \"Really?\" he said, reaching into Kodachi's mind.  \"You don't like them?  You strike me as the type who likes tacos as much as she does sausages.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKodachi blushed, she and the other four getting the innuendo immediately.  Kodachi glanced over and found herself starting to appreciate Akane, Shampoo, and Ukyo more than she realized.  Why had she not seen their beauty before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAkane, meanwhile, was wondering why she didn't feel the urge to clobber this guy for the perverted remark.  It was baffling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So what was all that about, anyway?\" the villain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The old pervert stole our panties,\" Ukyo muttered, embarrassed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shame.  Old fart like that doesn't deserve to have such treasures,\" the villain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We wouldn't mind if you stole them, though,\" Akane said.  Almost immediately, the other three women agreed.  And then they all realized what they said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...We go now,\" Shampoo said, blushing bright red.  \"We go chase Airen, help kill old pervert.\"  Akane, Ukyo, and Kodachi all nodded quickly, dashing off when Shampoo did, wondering what the hell was wrong with them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain smiled.  Things were proceeding nicely...</span></div></div>",

But there was more he could do.  He reached out and touched the minds of everyone in Nerima.  Only the Tendos, Ranma herself, Genma and Nodaka, Cologne, Happosai, and his other three would-be fiancees would remember that Ranma had been a guy.  They just wouldn't remember what he looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n////////<br>\r\nThat evening...<br>\r\n////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma grumbled as she came home that night.  She shook her head in frustration, taking off her shoes as she came in and calling out the traditional greeting.  When no one answered, she began to look around for everyone.  She found Kasumi first, greeting her politely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Welcome home, Ranma!\" Kasumi said, the beautiful young woman hard at work in the kitchen.  \"Sorry I didn't come out to greet you, I need to pay attention to this sauce.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma nodded.  \"No worries,\" she said.  \"Whatcha makin'?   It smells good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pumpkin soup, actually,\" Kasumi said.  \"I found the recipe online.  It looked interesting, so I figured I'd give it a try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Pumpkin, huh?\" Ranma said, looking into the pot.  \"Looks nasty, but it smells good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi giggled.  \"Yes, it does look rather 'Akane-esque' in appearance.  Just give it time, it will smooth out.  I hope you'll try it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If you're making it, it'll turn out great,\" Ranma said.  \"Pumpkin's not my favorite, but I don't hate it.  Pops and I ate some wild ones on the road while training.\"  She thought about it, and frowned.  \"I hope they were wild ones.  He said they were... Wouldn't put it past the old bastard to steal...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi patted her shoulder reassuringly.  \"I'm sure it will work out.  Why not change back and get ready for dinner?  I'm making beef teriyaki and riceballs with cheese tonight,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma smiled.  \"Sounds good,\" she said.  \"Anyone else in yet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Akane is on the roof,\" Kasumi said.  \"She seems very deep in thought, but she isn't telling anyone why.  Nabiki is in her room finishing off her homework.  Our fathers are off plotting yet another doomed-to-fail scheme to try and get you and  Akane to grow up and stop fighting long enough to marry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma quirked an eyebrow.  \"You have mastered the art of polite snarking, haven't you?\" she said, leaning against the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi sighed.  \"Even my patience has limits.  I love you, Ranma, and I always will.  Akane too.  But both of you have egos the size of Happosai's opinion of himself.  And you keep arguing over the same old things.\"  A sassy smirk crossed her face.  \"One would almost think you were an old married couple already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma rolled her eyes.  \"Funny,\" she said.  She knew Kasumi was right, she just didn't know how to work around Akane's damned temper... Ah well.  For another day, she supposed.  She headed to the bathroom and stripped down, filling a bath bucket with hot water as she stepped into the shower.  She dumped it on herself... and nothing happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe froze, an expression of horror locked on her face.  She stayed there for a long moment, going over EVERYTHING that happened today.  And as she did, she realized something even more frightening - she couldn't think of herself as a guy.  She couldn't even imagine herself as a male.  Drying off and quickly getting dressed, she ran back down to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi was surprised to see her still female.  \"Decided not to change?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tried.  Failed,\" Ranma said, visibly shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi understsood her fear.  \"Again?\" she said sadly.  <i>What could it be this time?</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Kasumi, I have a very important question and I need to you answer me in as much detail as possible,\" Ranma said.  \"What do I look like as a guy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKasumi blinked.  \"An odd question,\" she said.  \"You...\" She trailed off, an expression of growing horror on her face as she realized that she could only ever Ranma being a girl.  She knew it was wrong, but in every memory of Ranma she had, she was always a short, feisty red-headed woman.  \"Oh no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm getting everyone,\" Ranma said.  \"I'm being attacked again.  And if you can't remember, I have a bad feeling none of the others will remember me as a guy either...\" </span></div></div>",

He landed in the center of Pallet Town, just as Red was setting off on his Pokemon journey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe smiled as he looked around the quaint little village, tipping his hat politely at an old lady watering her flowers.  He felt bad for her, but he knew what he wanted.  He glanced around, seeing a young girl with an Eevee talking with a slightly older girl wearing a hat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElaine and Leaf, the villain thought, recognizing them as the female protaginists of the original games and Let's Go Eevee/Pikachu.  Cute young girls, they'd be perfect additions to his harem.  He glanced around the town again, and saw that this reality also had Delia from the anime as Red's mother.  The villain grinned.  He adored that MILF and would love to breed her over and over... Well, first things first.  He was starting his Pokemon journey!  And then meant Professor Oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe strode up to the laboratory and found the old man in there, with his grandson grumping in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can't BELIEVE that Red got here before me... And left with a friggin' Pikachu no less...\" Blue muttered, shaking his head.  \"Well, its his own fault if he falters.  Heard that Viridin and Pewter's gym leaders were Ground and Rock-type specialists...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Come now, Blue,\" Professor Oak said.  \"Don't let your sense of rivalry with Red overtake your common sense. You're both striving for the same thing, but that's no reason not to wish him luck.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want to be the champion!\" Blue snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And how wonderful would it be if you had a strong rival to beat at the end?\" Professor Oak said, smirking.  That seemed to mollify Blue, who relaxed a little as the villain strode up to the professor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hello there!\" the villain said, smiling.  \"I'm here to start my Pokemon journey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Starting it a little late, aren't you?\" Blue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tProfessor Oak shook his head.  \"Nonsense.  It's never too late to go on a journey,\" he said, smiling at the villain.  \"So how about you?  Going on a journey of self-discovery?  Recapturing your youth?  Just didn't have time before?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A little bit of youth recapturing... and I want to pick up some hot chicks,\" the villain said.  It was technically an honest answer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tProfessor Oak blinked, and then laughed.  \"I respect your honesty, my friend,\" he said.  \"And admittedly, there are some very lovely Pokemon trainers out there.  Anyway.  First, let's get you registered.\"  The villain nodded, and Professor Oak held up a form, with a pen ready to write down the villain's responses.  He smiled, and asked, \"Are you a boy or a girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain blinked.  \"...Are you fucking kidding me?\" he asked, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tProfessor Oak rolled his eyes, clearly having heard this before.  \"Look, the Kanto League insists that anyone registering someone ask ALL the questions on the registry form, including the stupidly obvious ones.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That explains that...\" Blue said, chuckling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"My name is Booby Mctits, I'm a fifteen year old girl,\" the villain snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tProfessor Oak facepalmed.  \"My.  How original,\" he said.  \"Just answer the questions, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain laughed, and cooperated.  Professor Oak entered them in and gave him a Pokedex.  \"Here you go,\" he said, gesturing to a table with some Pokeballs on it.  \"They've been picked over by people coming in earlier.  Blue's friend Red and a pair of young women named Elaine and Leaf were here earlier, and of course Blue has claimed his.\"  There was a single Pokeball on the table.  \"I hope you don't mind Squirtle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Not at all,\" the villain said, picking up the Pokeball.  He had picked the water starter in every Pokemon game he played, and he fully intended to do the same for this version of his 'journey.'  He clicked it open, and the little blue turtle appeared on the table, looking around curiously.  The villain instantly fell in love.  \"OH MY GOSH THEY'RE EVEN CUTER THAN THE PICTURES SAAAAAY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Squirtle looked up at its new master and grinned.  It couldn't speak human languages, but all Pokemon understood them.  It made happy noises as the villain petted him, leaning into his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"NGGGGH!\" the villain squeed.  \"SO cute!  And he turns into such a badass when he evolves.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Squir,\" Squirtle said, grinning.  He liked his new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"C'mon!\" the villain said.  \"We're goin' on an adventure!\" </span></div></div>",

She tried to lose him at first, flash stepping from building to building.  When it became apparent she wasn't going to lose her tail, she stopped on a rooftop, scowling.  \"You can stop trying to hide yourself.  You give off greater power than a Mega level.  There's no way I couldn't sense you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Stealth was never my strong point anyway,\" the villain said, appearing before her.  \"You wouldn't believe how badly I suck at Metal Gear Solid.\"  He wore black shorts and an open Hawaiian shirt, showing off his abs.  His hair was shoulder length and fluttered dramatically in the wind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon thought he looked silly.  \"You've gone to all this trouble to pursue me.  State your business,\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want to capture you, brainwash you, and turn you into my happy, pampered sex slave for all eternity,\" the villain said casually.

I appreciate the honesty, if nothing else,\" she said, flabbergasted at the man's audacity.  The villain bowed.  Renamon shook her head, clearing it.  \"But if you seriously think you can take me as your slave, you're wrong.  I serve none save Rika.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll take her along too,\" the villain said, shocking Renamon.  \"With how big I want you to get, you'll need a feeder when I'm not doing it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon growled.  \"Your intention is clear,\" she said.  \"I will not let you near Rika.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe man's smile turned dark.  \"You said it yourself, foxface,\" he said.  \"I am radiating more power than a Mega level Digimon.

She couldn't sense him at all.  The only thing left of him was trace blue sparks in the air.  She put her hands on her hips, trying to decide her next move... and her stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Better get something to eat,\" she said.  \"I'm starving all of a sudden.\"  She started to walk home.

She should have been far more on edge, especially with a threat to Rika's safety right before her and yet...the growling in her stomach rose, rumbles almost making her feel reverbs in her middle. A grimace finding its way on the yellow and white fox's face as her three-clawed hand grasped at her abdomen softly, a groan escaping under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More dire than I expected...I need food and fast...\" She muttered, leaping deftly back to ground level, albeit doing her best to stay out of sight and out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all-powerful pervert easily followed, instantly finding himself leaning up against a wall in a tight alley, seated atop a closed dumpster as he looked out on the bustling streets. Street vendors and trucks with food shipments alike all present and ripe for the taking. And by his will alone, he could even give the poor, starved vixen a helping hand; not a soul was the wiser to the fox making off in desperation with hot plates of takoyaki, with boxes of pre-wrapped sweet breads and entire bundles of vegetables tied up in red bands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet no matter how much Renamon took, her feverish feeding didn't fill the void burning in her middle. Just as he'd planned of course. The extra-dimensional traveler taking in the sight of Renamon's temperance wearing down in real time before him as entire balls of takoyaki vanished into her maw. As whole loaves of bread went from disappearing in a few bites to practically being eaten whole. Every bite, of course, only added more and more to Renamon's frame--he did warn her he liked his girls big! And he was going to have her bigger and bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...why am I still so hungry?!\" Renamon growled as she feverishly shoveled a handful of cheap convenience store riceballs into her mouth, bits of tacky rice smearing around the edges of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain had to hold down his chuckles; this was too easy! He really could just get any thing his way now, couldn't he? He could even see the poor, hapless yellow fox growing bit by bit before his eyes, fur and flesh bulging outwards as her cravings continued. She couldn't help herself, her burning hunger overtaking all other priorities in her mind. She didn't even seem to notice her developing bust making itself known from under the ruffle of white fur, growing by at least a whole cup size every few seconds. Her ass thickening atop a pair of creamy thighs coated in lemony yellow fur while her gut kept on pushing forwards. her arms thickening up as even her face could--if he looked carefully--be seen getting ever so slightly plumper and rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't stop, of course. Not unless the lascivious man willed it and he certainly wasn't feeling charitable towards her, right now. Just how big could she get if he left her like this...?</span></div></div>",

For a brief moment, even wondering if he overdid it. A brief moment. However, he could hardly complain as the figure before him settled itself into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon's breasts, once seemingly hidden or non-existent, became enormous spheres of white fur and flesh tantalizingly jiggling atop her form. The weighty motions sending ripples through her growing rolls of stomach fat that pushed outwards and further towards the ground. So enormous was her bust, those pillow-thick arms of hers were wobbling up against the delightful mounds every time more food was shoved into her ravenous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs looked more and more like enormous pillars of fat, the flesh above and below her knees looking as if stacked together, propping up her wide hips and enormous, shuddering backside as yellow furred buttocks began to weightily wobble and slap together, crashing and heaving like mounds of flan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the digimon herself was less than enthralled with her newfound blobby figure, yet she was unable to stop. An enormous plastic cup full of custard was vanishing rapidly past her fat face, as the faintest bits of cold chocolate dessert matted the edges of her muzzle before she began reflexively lapping it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why...why am I still so hungry?!\" She growled past a thickened, chubby paw shoveling sweet bean jam buns into her mouth, her already plush cheeks puffing up full of food before swallowing it all down. Her free paw grasping at her upper belly before sliding up under her enormous jugs, propping them up as they wobbled weightily back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bravado was quickly escaping from the enterprising dimensional traveler's face as he looked on, biting down on his lip as he began to fidget ever so slightly. This was the exact thing he'd dreamed of for so long, only experienced vicariously in fantasy and fanart until now and here it was, unfolding before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer titanic body was slow and lumbering in all the right ways, letting him hang back to drink in every last curve of Renamon's borderline blobby body shuddering, heaving and crashing. He began to gently rub his legs together, watching as he could hardly hold himself together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe <i>needed</i> her, <i>now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ravage that enormous, fat body and make her his! To push himself up against every inch and explore her curves to the fullest...knowing he could make her even bigger whenever he wanted and just do it again and again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could even see her, just out the corner of his eye, squeezing her elephantine form into a street where no one else seemed to be following (if only because he'd left the people nearby ever so blissfully unaware of her.) If he wanted to claim her, here and now, he'd be hard-pressed to find a better chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, he could always make his own chances.

Groaning, she squeezed herself into an alley, her once graceful steps now heavy and plodding.  Her legs were thick pillars of furry fat, her belly a vast apron of doughy flesh that hung down to her knees, tightly packed with food.  Her breasts, once A-cup and hidden under her fur and neckfluff, had ballooned out and were now larger than her head, thick, puffy nipples showing through.  Her hips were now wide, swaying with every movement, her ass thick and huge, the cheeks clapping together with every movement.  Her arms now were so thick they had 'wings' of fat on them, and her neck had ballooned out into a thick double-chin.  Her every movement set her body jiggling, and her stomach made loud glorping and gurgling noises as it struggled to digest the vast amount of food she had injested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fox Digimon groaned, fondling her flabby body, squeezing her belly rolls, hefting her blubbersome breasts, even squeezing her own ass.  Every movement of her body was labored, even her great strength doing little to prevent herself from tiring out.  Every part of her felt heavy, and her mouth and chins were covered in sauce remnants from her meals.  And for some reason, despite panting heavily, her fat chest weighing down her lungs, she felt fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why does this feel so good?\" Renamon moaned, shaking her heavy belly and belching.  \"BBWWAAAAARRRRP!!  Ogh... So heavy...\" She licked her lips, clearing them of food as best she could.  She squeezed her flab again, confused.  \"I should be scared... But instead I just feel great...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I can make you feel even better,\" the villain said, teleporting near her, unable to resist her any longer.  Before Renamon could protest, he began to massage her heavily bloated belly, the fox Digimon groaning in pleasure as his gentle kneading and squeezing of her bellyfat helped her digestion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oooogh...\" she groaned blissfully, leaning up against the alley wall.  \"That feels... UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!!  That feels so good... BWAOOORRP!!\"  Heavy belches escaped her throat as the villain sunk his hands deep within her bellyfat, massaging her aching stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain himself was almost drooling with lust.  Her fat-laden flesh felt so soft to the touch, her fur silky smooth.  This was so much better than the fanart, because it was real.  She was here, and he could touch her, do what he wanted with her.  \"Mmmmph, so beautiful...\" he said, his cock fully erect and hard as a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon blushed, looking at the man.  Truthfully, he wasn't that bad-looking, now that she thought of it.  And his bellyrubs made her feel so good...  \"Why?\" she asked.  \"Why me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Because you're beautiful.  I've always lusted after you, wanted to see you fat,\" the villain said, grinning.  He leaned in and gave her a kiss, not caring about the sauce on her chins.  He wiped his mouth clean of the sauce after pulling away, grinning wider when he saw Renamon blushing.  \"I meant every single word I said.  I want to make you my fat, pampered pet for all eternity.  Eternal youth, immortality, and all the food you can eat...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon had no idea why she was considering it.  She should be striking him.  But (mainly because of the villain's mental manipulation) she was starting to like his idea more and more.  \"...What about Rika and her family?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Rika's also on my list.  Her family and your friends will be taken care of, if I decide not to take them.  And don't worry about Digimon threats.  I am considering capturing and enslaving your entire race,\" the villain said, reaching into her mind and changing how she felt about what he said.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"You're certainly ambitious,\" Renamon said, chuckling.  \"Are you certain you can handle that many slaves and harem girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You have no idea what I'm capable of, my dear,\" the villain said.  \"But I want you to be my first.  First among my harem girls, worshipped and adored by all of them.  The ideal woman, with the ideal body that I am just BARELY holding myself back from ravishing right now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon bit her lip.  Even without his mental manipulation, she could feel the adoration and love coming off of this man.  And the promise of being loved and pampered forever was strangely appealing.  To her shock, she found that she was wet too, the fur of her pussy matted with growing need, tingling with desire.  She made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then don't hold back, Master,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain's eyes widened.  \"Did you just say...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I haven't felt this good before,\" Renamon almost cooed.  \"I want you, Master.  I want to be yours.  Take me right here.  Make my fat body shake.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain couldn't be more aroused if he tried.  He had WON.  Renamon was HIS now.

The plush, springy feel of her fat belly along with her thick, fluffy fur made her feel like a giant plush toy.  He saw Renamon grinning up at him, and grinned back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Enjoying yourself, Master?\" she teased, flicking an ear, the effect adorable on her plump face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Very much so,\" the villain said, kissing where her navel was, teasingly poking a finger into it and making her moan with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon didn't know why she was enjoying this so much, being treated like a plaything, stuffed to the point where her stomach hurts and made ridiculously fat.  But she felt so good.  And feeling her master enjoy her body was turning her on more and more.  She desperately wanted to feel his cock inside her now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnable to restrain himself anymore, he lifted up her belly, letting it rest against his body, and reached underneath it, feeling between her thick thighs until he found her pussy.  Now, he'd never admit this aloud, but the villain was actually a virgin.  This the first time he'd felt a woman's cunt, stroking his fingers along the fat-filled folds, making Renamon moan in pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA woman's pussy, he thought, his mind clouded with lust.  Grunting, he stepped forward, using his cosmically-enhanced strength to hold her gut out of the way while he thrust his rock hard member into her cunt.  There was a brief resistance as her hymen tore, Renamon wincing in sudden pain, but that was replaced by sheer pleasure as her master began to thrust in and out of her, her blubbersome body shaking as she was fucked, her cunt filled to the brim by his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnconsciously, the man had increased the size of his cock to fill her pussy completely.  He also was rewriting her mind so that he would be the only man capable of getting her off.  He wanted Renamon to be his and his alone, although he'd let other harem girls play with her.  And oh, how good it felt to be wrapped up in that warm, wet cunt.  He thrust in and out of her, his hips slamming against hers, making her many rolls of fat wobble pleasantly, her flabby breasts boucning up and down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon moaned in delight, fondling her thick, flabby breasts and tweaking her nipples.  She couldn't believe how good sex felt.  She'd heard Rika watching porn sometimes when she thought her mother was gone, and seen her playing with herself, but had never done so.  She also knew the basics of human reproduction, and that sex was a part of it.  Now, with her master's cock filling her up, she knew she could never get enough.  She would be master's gloriously fat slut forever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain shivered in lust, thrusting harder and faster into Renamon's eager cunt, her massive body wobbling back and forth.  He spanked her massive ass, making her yelp in pleasure, the feel of his body wrapped up in her soft, furry fat sending him into raptures of pleasure.  Already he could feel his release building up, like a growing pressure in a firehose.  \"Hnngh... Renamon... Gonna cum...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon was near her climax too, both former virgins on the verge of release because of their inexperience.  Moaning, Renamon begged, \"Do it!  Master, shoot your seed inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEncouraged, the villain thrust hard, finally letting go.  A torrent of hot cum shot into Renamon's pussy and into her womb, a warmth filling Renamon as she hit her climax at the same time, her cunt clenching around his cock and gushing fluids as she yowled in bliss, a feral sound.  The two lovers, panting happily, still mounted in each other, rested as they slowly came down from their orgasmic highs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Confession time,\" the villain said, deciding to be honest.  \"This was my first time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon grinned.  \"Mine too.  But... really?  The first time you've ever been with a woman?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain nodded.  \"Yep.  And I'm glad you were my first,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRenamon blushed warmly, proud and honored to be the one to take her master's virginity.  A part of her realized how insane it was to think this, but the hypnotized part of her mind, overwhelming more and more of her senses, shushed that voice.  It would never speak up again, silenced by the newfound love she had for the man who was her owner.</span></div></div>",

The villain lay on top of her, creating snack cakes and candy bars out of thin air and feeding them to her, the two lovers content to just enjoy each other's company for now.  Renamon luxuriated in her new, gluttonous fatness, savoring each treat as it slid down her throat, not caring if she got cream or frosting around her lips.  Occasionally, she would let out a belch, savoring the warmth in her belly and womb.  As she did, though, Renamon found herself thinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t...Rika should be a part of this, she thought.  I feel happy, content...  And my body is so wonderfully soft...

Reaching out with his powers, he did a little creative banking, creating a perfect bribe.  Creating a disguise for himself, he also reached out to contact Kimihito's parents via a created cell phone.  To his dismay, they easily proved willing to sell the house, saying that their 'useless son' could just find an apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe funneled more money into his account in this world, robbing some rich businessmen who had more money than they'd ever need.  He teleported directly to Kimihito's house, finding the door unlocked.  Frowning, he went inside, finding Kimihito on the phone screaming at his parents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...But where am I supposed to go?!\" he asked.  \"Damn it, you can't just sell our house out from under me!

You can call me Phil,\" he said.  \"I am prepared to make amends for this by offering you five times the amount of money I gave your parents, and help you move into a new house.  A better, bigger one than this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blinked.  \"...You certainly have a lot of money to throw around,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I run a pharmaceutical company,\" the villain said.  \"Started makin' a fortune and a half when Reagan started letting us go for-profit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, that'd do it,\" Kimihito muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The point is,\" the villain said, \"I am not completely heartless.  Its unfair that this was sprung on y'all.  I can have you in a new home, with a big bank account to spend, within the next couple days.  And your parents don't have to know about any of it, since the account will be in your name.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito frowned, looking around his childhood home for a long moment... and nodded.  \"Sure.  Fuck them, and fuck this place,\" Kimihito said, shaking the villain's hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took two days to set everything up, but Kimihito and his possessions were moved out of the house and into a larger home several miles away from the house.  The villain bought some furniture and some food to refill the place, settling himself in.  It was a fairly modest home, but he only needed to keep it that way at first.  Once Ms. Smith belonged to him, then he could get away with messing with space/time.  </span></div></div>",

Peering a bit more, he saw that the world also  held more of Akamatsu's work, like <i>A.I. Love You</i> and the <i>Negima </i>series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With this world, I can have a harem of Magic, a harem of technology, and a harem of normal women,' He thought before making some hand gestures. \"First, let's change some things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImportant events were changed. Keitaro had managed to get into Tokyo University on his first try, thus impressing his parents enough that he was allowed to have his own apartment, away from the Hinata in. The Villain wasn't sure if his new powers could overcome Keitaro's odd luck and immortality, but wasn't going to take chances at this stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Hina was upset and did try to get Keitaro to be the new landlord, but a phone call had changed her mind. As she was telling the girls that the new landlord would be a westerner, He stepped through the portal and appeared in an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to see the potential members of my first harem...\" he said to himself as he headed to the Inn, casting various protection spells on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front door, he could overhear what was going on inside the Inn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now he should be arriving soon. I trust that you will all treat him well,\" Granny Hina said to Naru, Kitsune, Motoko, and Su.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Granny Hina! What if he is a pervert?\" Naru asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held back a chuckle and thought, <i>'If she only knew...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have it on good authority that he won't do anything unless you give consent,\" Granny Hina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'And I'll get that consent, whether they want to give it or not,' </i>He thought before knocking. Once the door was opened, he said, \"Hello! I am Maxwell King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the new landlord. Well, I must be off. My world-wide cruse won't wait forever,\" Granny Hina said before she left the Inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Granny Hina was out of sight, Naru began to shove her finger against the Villain's chest, saying, \"Granny Hina said you're supposed to be the Landlord. What makes you think we'll even allow you to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny Hina's orders?\" He asked. \"But perhaps let's make it interesting. Who here can fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can,\" Motoko answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make it interesting. If you win, I'll explain to Granny Hina that you all made a good argument that you can go without a landlord. If I win-\" He began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't win,\" Naru interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF! If I win,\" He continued, looking a bit mad at Naru for interrupting him. He might be a powerful pervert, but he wasn't going to talk over people. He had standards,afterwords. \"Then Motoko will serve as my assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Motoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you afraid?\" He asked, knowing that will rile Motoko up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotoko pointed a boken at the villain and said, \"I will win and I will break you, perverted male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was one-sided with Motoko being slapped silly until she was knocked unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I win. I'll take her to her room. Granny Hina told me which room is hers,\" He said as he put Motoko on his shoulder, taking a moment to secretly grope her butt and slip a spell or two on her. One was to make her his servant. The other was to make her extremely perverted towards women in private unless her new master told her not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru looked upset and mad for there now being a man in her paradise. Su looked sad because she knew how prideful Motoko was about her fighting skills. Kitsune looked worried, right up until she saw the new Landlord grope Motoko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Hinata Fox began to make plans to try and trick him into becoming her servant, not knowing all her plans were bound to fail.</span></div></div>",

He let himself take on his human appearance before his ascension, that of a chubby, hairy man in his 30s with a graying beard.  \"And there's just four waifus here.  So it should be relatively simple.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it was creepy, he knew that.  But this was a fetish fanfiction about turning fictional characters into sex slaves, involving things the author wouldn't even conceive of doing in real life.  So it's fine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found Sayori talking with the player character of the game.  The villain frowned.  He was evil, yes, but he hated to see people suffer.  Honestly, he was doing Sayori a favor by putting her in a better environment.  He could literally just edit her depression away.  For now, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!  Is this the way to class?\" he asked them, introducing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayori looked up at him and blinked.  New information inserted itself into her head, painting him as a new student, and that there was nothing odd about the way he looked.  \"Oh!\" she said, smiling.  \"Yes, its this way.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said, walking with them.  \"I heard that there were a lot of clubs at this school.  Is that right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe player character nodded, Sayori smiling and confirming that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything like a book club?  At my old school back in the states, I was a member of the book club,\" the villain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayori's smile widened.  \"Actually... Yeah!  Yeah there is!  We're not very big yet, so we're looking for new members.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If its full of girls as cute as you, then I definitely want to join,\" the villain said, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayori blushed, giggling.  Once they got to school, Sayori let the player character go on his way, asking him to think about joining.  As he left, the villain placed the thought that he wouldn't join in his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the confusion in the air, as if another reality bender was watching the scene and saw something unexpected.  He smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayori tugged on his sleeve.  \"This way!\" she said.  She explained the literature club to him, along with its other members, Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika.  He listened patiently despite knowing all this already.  When she brought him into the room, the girls all had mixed reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he still had his aura of attractiveness despite being in his normal human form, Yuri glanced over his entire body and smiled.  Natsuki looked at him with suspicion, although she was blushing.  The villain smiled in response to seeing she had brought cupcakes.  Reluctantly, she offered him one and he made sure to lavish praise for it, composing a short haiku then and there about delicious cupcakes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious sweets.<br>\r\nMy praise to the genius.<br>\r\nWho put cake in a cup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayori giggled. \"Not EXACTLY the right form for a haiku,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain smiled.  \"Poetry writing's my weak point.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have plenty of time to work on it with us,\" Yuri said.  \"Right Monika?\" She blinked.  \"Monika?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonika was staring, wide-eyed at the villain.  She knew.  She knew what he was, and what he was doing there.  She gestured, pulling on the strings of reality, trying to get him to leave, to get the girls to chase him off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the villain just pulled them right back into place.  Monika shivered in fear as he walked up to her and offered her a handshake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to getting to know you all better,\" the villain said, grinning demonically.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, unwilling to 'break character,' Monika offered her hand shakily.  \"I-It's a pleasure...\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be,\" the villain said in his best Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa Shang Tsung voice.  \"It will be...\" </span></div></div>",

The other three girls looked at the two of them worriedly, but he smiled and said, \"I'm sure it'll be fine.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd they believed it, going about their business.  Monika gulped nervously.  The villain smiled, and gestured for Monika to lead the way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey went into a closet.  Monika immediately rewrote it, turning it into a large, empty room with windows leading out into space.  The villain recognized it as the Just Monika room from the ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why are you here?\" Monika asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I want to start a collection of beautiful, devoted women who live for pleasuring me.  I want to spoil them all rotten, to the point where they can't even conceive of what life is without me.  I want to breed them forever, keeping them fat and pregnant over and over again.  I want them because I have the power and I intend to abuse it,\" the villain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMonika facefaulted.  She hadn't been expecting the honesty.  \"...You're certainly straightforward.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I find being open about my intentions speeds things along,\" the villain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Quite,\" Monika said.  \"...And here I thought I'd be the one putting my friends in danger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes,\" the villain said.  \"A rather pathetic motive.  All because you weren't given a route in the dating game that is your life.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMonika scowled.  \"Is it so wrong to want love?\" <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"At the expense of driving those you care about insane?  Yes!\" the villain said, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're just a pervert,\" Monika said, shaking her head.  \"You couldn't understand.\"  She glared at him.  \"How many women do you plan to add to your harem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"As many as I feel like,\" the villain said.  \"Billions.  Trillions.  Limits are for those who have them.  I don't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMonika scoffed.  \"HA!  I bet you'll never be able to pleasure them all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"First off, it doesn't matter if I can.  I want them.  That's enough.  And two...\"  He grinned, and the room became an empty field on the moon, with thousands of himself surrounding a terrified Monika on all sides.  \"...I am more than capable of handling as many women as I want.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMonika staggered, falling to her knees.  As she did, the room became a closet again, the villain exiting to chat with Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki.  Monika stared at him, frightened.  She had just recently learned how to tweak reality, and yet here was someone so much more skilled at it than her.  She had to stop him somehow, before he enslave them all, before he could seduce the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHelping her friends.  Wow, that felt weird to say after everything she was initially planning.</span></div></div>",

He'd start with the actual women before collecting some genderbent women.  But first, he had some arrangements to make...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nA month later...<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChun-Li suspected something was up.  Guile's wife and daughter, Ken's wife, Dhalsim's wife, Hakan's wife, Rufus's girlfriend, Yun &amp; Yang's female friends, Alex's friend Patricia, Elena's mother, Necro's girlfriend, Abigail's associate Roxy, all of them dying mysteriously in 'accidents' that destroyed their bodies beyond repair, making them unrecognizable.  Followed soon after by 'counsellors' helping them to control their grief and move on with their lives.  All save Elena were sad, but functional.  Far faster that what someone should be after losing someone so close.  Elena's family, on the other hand, had moved on like all the men did.  Which was the sticking point that made Chun-Li uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then Li-Fen, a girl she had been guarding, disappeared, with only an invitation to a tournament in her place.  An invitation addressed to Chun-Li.  One that she didn't dare turn down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tournament itself was being held literally in the middle of nowhere, an island that hadn't been there before, shrouded in mist.  Chun-Li had been warned, via someone breaking into Interpol's intercoms and talking to her directly, that if anyone had tried to follow her, that they would die.  With no other choice, she had set out for the island, arriving alongside other competitors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first one she noticed was Cammy, being accompanied by the Dolls, all of them dressed up in their old uniforms.  Cammy frowned when she noticed her.  \"So you've been lured here as well,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChun-Li nodded, coming over to her.  \"The person or persons responsible for this kidnapped a girl I'm taking care of,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That young hacker girl?\" Cammy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChun-Li nodded.  \"Yeah.\"  She looked to Marz, and nodded.  \"Good to see you alive.  I was worried you were killed during the final battle with Bison.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMarz nodded.  \"I got out, thankfully,\" she said, picking at her uniform.  \"Never thought I'd be wearing this again.  But the tournament master insisted.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChun-Li frowned.  \"What was your lure?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCammy shivered.  \"They kidnapped Lita Luwanda, from Delta Red.  And they also threatened to ressurect M.Bison,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChun-Li blinked, the idea horrifying her.  \"Insanity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCammy grinned weakly.  \"You can understand, then, why we felt like showing up...\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tChun-Li nodded.  \"We'll stop them,\" she said firmly.  \"And we'll get everyone back.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs they walked around the island, looking for the path to the center, they encountered other female fighters.  Rose and her student Menat, drawn by the presence of a powerful evil.  Sakura Kasugano, drawn in by her friend being kidnapped.  Lucia Morgan, drawn in by the threat of an assassination attempt against Cody.  Rainbow Mika and her partner Yamato Nadeshiko, lured in by the threat of a terrorist attack on their next show.  Karin Kanzuki, drawn in by the capture of her entire contingent of kunoichi.  Maki Genryusai, drawn in by the theat of an assassination attempt against her father and Guy.  Ingrid, drawn in by one of her important artifacts being stolen.  Ibuki, who like Sakura, was drawn in by a friend being kidnapped.  Elena, who was lured in by the reveal that her mother was alive, but kidnapped.  (Which made Chun-Li wonder how many of the recent 'deaths' were actually kidnappings.)  Makoto, drawn in by a threat of her dojo being destroyed.  A very agitated Crimson Viper lured in by the kidnapping of her daughter.  Juri Han, who had been lured in by the promise of a strong prey.  Poison, who like Elena was lured with the promise of a friend, in this case Roxy, being alive.  Laura Matsuda, who's brother Sean had been beaten half to death, participating because the person involved said he'd pay for all of his hospital bills.  Falke, who had been lured in by the threat of Bison's revival.  Kolin, who had come of her own initiative after Gill sensed the tournament master's power.  The last one to show up shocked everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"SETH!?\" Cammy shouted, once she recognized the voice coming out of the buxom, silver-skinned woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Indeed,\" thundered Seth, the muscular woman's voice deep and masculine.  \"And I must say, I am not thrilled to see any of you here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJuri sneered.  \"You're looking a lot saner than I remember,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeth chuckled.  \"Be nice.  This body is based on you.  So its quite obvious to me that my dementia was caused by your genetic imperfections,\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Okay, I'mma gonna beg this guy to let me fight you first,\" Juri said, her eye twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeth sneered.  \"We'll see,\" she said.  \"The one responsible for luring us all here gave me the upgrade that maintains my sanity and dignity.  He promised to make it permanent if I am victorious.  So I fully intend to defeat you all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So it's a definite he, then?\" Chun-Li asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh indeed,\" Seth said.  \"A ridiculous man with a warrior's body and silver hair.  He had several women with him that appeared brainwashed when he came to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn it...\" Chun-Li said, frowning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"MAMA!\" said a voice.  Every fighter turned, and Crimson Viper almost collapsed in relief.  Lauren ran out, Viper hugging her tightly.  At the same time, Li-Fen ran up to Chun-Li, Chun-Li gratefully scooping up the young girl and hugging her.  Elena's mother Amina walked out, Elena sobbing as she ran up to hug her.  Lita Luwanda sauntered out, going up to Cammy and the Dolls, while Ibuki and Sakura's friends, Sarai Kurowsawa and Kei Chitose, ran out to hug them.  Roxy strutted out next, smiling warmly at Poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hey, PoiPoi,\" Roxy said, the redheaded woman in Daisy Duke denim shorts and a revealing halter top said.  \"Looks like you made it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So did you...\" Poison said, an ill-feeling coming over her.  \"And here you are... Walking out on your own...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeth realized it next.  \"Good eye, girl...\" she said, folding her arms under her ample chest, the Tanden Engine in her stomach spinning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElena, Chun-Li, Sakura, Ibuki, Viper, and Cammy all looked at their returned loved ones warily.  Roxy snickered.  \"No reason to pretend anymore, is there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLauren kissed Viper on the cheek.  \"Sorry, Mommy.  We're not really free.  Master has freed our minds, and made us his servants,\" she said, Viper's face becoming horrified.  Chun-Li looked at Li-Fen, who nodded, smiling apologetically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No... No, mama...\" Elena said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAmina hugged the leggy young woman.  \"Fear not.  I am in no pain.  And happier than I have ever been,\" she said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKei nodded, smiling at a frightened Sakura.  \"Come and see.  We're here to guide you.  Master awaits.\"  Li-Fen pulled herself out of Chun-Li's grip.  Lauren tried to leave, but a teary-eyed, frightened Crimson Viper wouldn't let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's okay, Mommy,\" Lauren said, grinning.  \"I'm not going anywhere.  Master just has a flare for the dramatic.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLita, one hand on her sword, smiled.  \"Follow us.  Stick to the path.  We'll lead you to the tournament grounds.\"  The brainwashed women all ran off, heading into the mist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone hesitated.  Crimson Viper, shivering with fear and rage, flexed her fingers, making her gauntlets spark with electricity.  \"...No offense, everyone,\" she said, her voice husky with rage, \"but I'm going to fucking murder everyone who gets in the way of me going home with my daughter.\"  With a snarl, she stood up and walked into the mist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone looked at each other worriedly.  \"...We shall learn nothing by dallying,\" Seth said.  \"Come.\"  She floated off into the mist, and one by one, the other fighters followed her, visibly worried.  Chun-Li was the last to leave, uncertain.  A chill passed through her.  She felt that something major was about to happen.  She just had no idea what...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd picked a close-to-canon reality where Morrigan had convinced Lilith to become her sister instead of absorbing her, so the Aenslands were an obvious target.  Alternatively, there was Felicia and her pride of catgirls.  That one would be a little trickier, as he didn't want to leave the orphans she took care of without a denmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...He could always just have her eat them and absorb their souls into her body.  He liked vore and fat girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, something to consider.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea he had was to simply start a fight with one of the Darkstalkers, lure them out one by one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was this particularly delicious idea... Demitri Maximoff, a powerful vampire, had a technique called the Midnight Bliss.  It turned men into women, and women into weaker versions of themselves, leaving them vulnerable to being drained of blood and life energy, reverting back to normal in an explosion.  He could attack Demitri, and turn the Midnight Bliss back on Demitri himself.  And then, once he was a sexy female, he could have her make the Midnight Bliss transformations permanent and use them on all the Darkstalker men, giving him MORE options for his harem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this was gonna be a fun trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BABY I'M THE TROUBLE MAN!\" he finished, cackling wildly, startling a group of sleeping bats which took to the sky in fright, unintentionally creating the perfect scary effect as they flew past the full moon's light.  </span></div></div>",

In fact, he's such a fan of the Sonic series that he also enjoyed the Archie comic, throughout all of its storylines both bad and good, and even the IDW comic as well!  He also watched Sonic Boom, because it was hilarious.  No matter the game, he played it or watched a Let's Play of it.  Hell, there were even some decent genderbends of the males. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, he didn't feel like shifting through multiple variants to get everyone.  So he found one that combined elements of every game, show, and comic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, there we go.  The world, currently, was recovering from the events of Sonic Forces.  Neo Metal Sonic had been defeated.  Sonic was an independent agent who worked with the Freedom Fighters frequently, and Sally's team more than once.  Amy and Knuckles were the leaders and coordinators of the various Freedom Fighter groups, while Sally's people were known more as the Royal Knights, an individual Freedom Fighter group.  Freedom Fighter groups from before and after the reboot of the Archie comic were there, along with Sticks, who defended an island that Sonic, Amy, Tails, and Knuckles liked to vacation on from time to time, and Tangle and Whisper were recent recruits into the greater Freedom Fighters organization.  Sonic and Tails' parents from before the reboot were in this timeline, which meant he had MILFs to collect...  Eggman had his Egg Bosses, as well as reluctant allies in the Dark Legion, led by Lien-Da, and Dr. Starline as his direct assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaaand there was Eggman planning to use a robotic zombification plague.  That had to go.  With a quick snap of his fingers, he erased the roboticization virus and made Eggman and his minions forget they were ever working on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, he could work with this.  Now.  Who to add to his harem first?  There were some obvious choices, but perhaps he could test the waters with someone less well known...</span></div></div>",

The Merah Diamond is the purest diamond in the world!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNearby, a stunned appraiser nodded.  \"I've done the math, people.

The crystal resembled a pure white Chaos Emerald.  But something about it was able to hold Rouge's attention.  Already sensitive to the presence of treasure, Rouge leaned foward, her robe falling to reveal one of her ample breasts.  \"Incredible...\" she said softly, entranced by the beauty of the gem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRichman continued.  \"Ah believe in the basic goodness of people.  That's why ah will let the Merah Diamond be put on public display for all to view and enjoy.  ah will also donate a substantial amount of rings to the Station Square Museum, so that they may be funded for years t'come!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge wiped away a bit of drool.  \"Okay,\" she said softly.  \"Calm down, Rouge... Something about this doesn't add up.  Why would anyone let such a pretty... so very pretty...\" Rouge shook her head.  \"A gorgeous gem like that just be put on display?  This doesn't feel right...\" She stared at the gem some more.  \"...But I won't know if its a trap or not unless I go...\" Rouge was conflicted.  Her survival instinct was flaring up at the same time as her greedy need for gems was.  \"So pretty...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom the shadows of her apartment, the villain, having discarded his 'Richman' disguise after legitimately making the payments (he was a villain, not a scumbag), watched carefully, to see if Rouge would take the bait...</span></div></div>",

Slowly, carefully, she made her way into the display area for the Merah Gem, pausing just outside the range of the lights in the room.  She pulled out some powder and blew on it, creating a cloud that revealed the criss-crossing security lasers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Heh, same as last time,\" Rouge said.

No sign of security, no sign of a rival coming in, no sign of one of the Doctor's machines... Everything was going perfectly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tToo perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer hand hesitated over the gem for a long moment.  Every instinct of hers was screaming at her to leave, to abandon the gem.  It wasn't worth it.  But a gem worth so many rings... So very, very shiny...  Her greed won out over her common sense, and her hand closed around the Merah Gem, pulling it out of the glass case.  At which point a bright light flashed, blinding her, and her body felt oddly light, a tingling shooting through her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn it, damn it, DAMN IT!\" she shouted.  \"It WAS a trap!\" <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tWhen her vision cleared, she was in her usual outfit of a black, cleavage-exposing leotard with a heart-shaped top, with white boots and gloves with heart-shaped highlights.  She was also sitting on the lap of Phil T. Richman, albeit a much handsomer looking version of him, with a muscular body, anime-esque short silver hair, and a more neatly trimmed goatee.  Glancing around, she found herself in a lavish penthouse, one that made her apartment look like a poor person's apartment by comparison.  Platinum lined the walls and furniture, all of it made of rich mahogony or oak, the curtains and Phil's clothing, an open vest and shorts, made of silk.  And the gem was still in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Um...\" Rouge managed after a moment.  \"Hi?\" She grinned nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hello yourself, beautiful,\" Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm guessing you're a sorcerer of some kind,\" Rouge tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Try traveling cosmic pervert,\" Phil said, casually leaning back on the couch they were on.  \"Here to collect beautiful women and add them to my harem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's... intimidating...\" Rouge conceded.  She wanted to get off of his lap and try to get away.  His arms weren't holding her, and there seemed to be nothing tying her down.  Except she found her body unwilling to cooperate.  \"...I can't seem to leave.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, that's the affects of the Merah Gem I created,\" Phil said.  \"It subtly alters your mind to make you want to be with me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I see...\" Rouge said.  The more she thought about it, the more she thought that her captor was indeed rather attractive... which was odd for her, since she wasn't into humans.  \"So basically...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're mine.  Your body has accepted it.  Your mind will follow soon enough,\" Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge whimpered a little.  She tried to think of a way out of this, but increasingly she found her thoughts fighting back against her desires. Why leave? she found herself thinking.  I'm right where I need to be, at my Master's side.  \"I just realized,\" Rouge said, mainly to distract herself, \"Merah is just Harem backwards, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Correct,\" Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The entire thing was just bait for me, wasn't it?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Indeed.  And yes, you can keep the gem, and no, my real name's not Phil,\" the villain said.  \"I haven't decided on what I want to be called yet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge chuckled weakly.  \"Believe it or not, I'm kinda glad for that.  Being enslaved by a villain named Phil T. Richman would destroy any credibility I had...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain laughed.  </span></div></div>",

All I ask is unquestioning obedience...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge gulped nervously.  It sounded good, and her body was starting to get warm with desire from being near him.

But that part was being overwhelmed by the part that flat out wanted to belong to this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain grinned, cupping her chin.  \"You really like using your mouth,\" he said.  \"But I can think of a better use for it.\"  He set Rouge down between his legs, putting her right in view of his erection, which was bulging out the sweatpants he was wearing.  Because Mobians were only half as tall as humans, Rouge was in a perfect position for a blowjob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge swallowed hard, unable to tear her eyes from the villain's cock.  Slowly, almost reverently, she pulled down his sweatpants, his massive sword of an erection and huge, heavy balls popping free.  Far too big for a Mobian usually, which is why Rouge never flirted with humans seriously, but somehow she knew that this massive dick could fit her pussy anyway.  She licked her lips, staring at it.  \"It's beautiful...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No more words,\" the villain said, pleased with her reaction but getting a little anxious.  \"Suck.  And use those amazing breasts of yours, too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOf course, she thought, grinning lustfully and pulling down her heart-shaped top.  Her immense bosom popped free, her nipples firm with arousal.  Cooing, she wrapped her boobs around his dick, taking his cockhead into her mouth as well.  The meaty, manly flavor made Rouge moan in lust, the bat feeling herself get wet as she rubbed her breasts up and down on the man's thick length, swallowing his cock as she began to bob her head up and down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Mmm, yeah...\" the villain said, licking his lips.  \"You work the shaft...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA thrill of warmth filled her, and she eagerly rubbed his massive member between her breasts, suckling and slurping his cock lovingly.  She kissed his shaft, feeling it quiver with pleasure as her soft, plush breasts rubbed over it.  She expertly swirled her tongue around his shaft, his thick length completely engulfed by her warm mouth and soft breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain moaned softly.  \"Goddamn... You're an eager little cocksucker, ain'tcha?  Your boobs and mouth are amazing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge fluttered her wings happily, slurping her master's cock lewdly.  She lowered her head completely down onto it, feeling it curve down her gullet as she deep throated him, licking at his balls.  The manly flavor of him was addicting, and she found herself wanting more and more.  She eagerly sucked her master's cock, wanting to taste his cream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain grunted, grabbing her head and jamming it down on his cock, making her take his cock up to the hilt.  He shot out his load, his cum load so thick that her cheeks bulged out.  \"SWALLOW IT!\" he commmanded.  Like a good slut, Rouge complied, gulping down her master's creamy, hot seed, savoring the flavor of his babygoo.  She moaned, gulping down as much as possible, the surges of cum so thick that some came out her nose.  He held her down on his cock the entire time, not letting her up until he was completely drained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce he was done, he let her withdraw.  She licked her lips, grinning up at her Master.  Any pretense of resistance was gone, Rouge fully under the man's control.  She teasingly opened her mouth, showing the leftovers of his cum on her tongue, and swallowed it.  \"Was I good, Master?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain grinned, patting her head affectionately.  \"You did splendidly, my dear,\" he said.  \"I'll have to make use of that mouth more in the future.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRouge giggled happily.

Gesturing, he made a 'grid' of sorts out of the multiverse.  Moving it around like he was using a cell phone screen, flicking with his fingers, he eventually came across something surprising.  A nexus of worlds, all connected to Disney.  The world of Kingdom Hearts was loosely connected to these worlds, as were the worlds of Marvel and Star Wars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd of course, the Nexus was in the same triple-circle Mickey Mouse head shape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain shook his head, shaking his head.

So he looked for settings where the differences from canon were superficial (they chose something else for lunch one day, for example).  He found an acceptable variant world rather quickly.  He started to enter the Nexus... and bounced off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...What the fuck,\" the villain said, looking confused.

I WON'T!\" With a final flaring punch, he tore a hole in the Nexus.  Working his fingers into it, he roared, yanking open a tearing a massive hole in the Nexus and stepping through.  He fired his power at the hole, cauterizing it and locking it open.  \"Mine...\" he growled, looking towards the worlds.  He took a moment to calm himself down, and coughed.  \"Okay.  Let's do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDeciding to leave Star Wars, Kingdom Hearts, and Marvel alone for now, he decided towards the primary Disney Nexus.

If you mess with me, you're gonna get scratched,\" the villain sang as he stood atop the tallest building in the city, doing a silly dance.  One of Mayor Manx's projects, he guessed.  It looked gaudy enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe had not changed his appearance at all, a human in a world of kats.  And he didn't care.  He wanted to stand out. He wanted EVERYONE to know he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBecause he wouldn't stop until he left with the entire female population of Megakat City, he'd decided.  Oh, there were some that would stand out, would be part of his 'main' harem, but he wanted them all.  Greed and Lust filled him and he felt no reason to deny it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he danced, the door opened behind him, Commander Feral, Callie Briggs, and a very frightened, visibly dragged there Mayor Manx stood.  The towering Feral aimed a pistol at him, the dark-furred kat glaring, while the pink-clad, blonde-furred Callie stood just behind him, ready with a can of pepper spray.  Mayor Manx looked terrified at the unknown creature.  Which was fine for the villain, as he had no love for the idiot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Who are you?!  What are you doing here?!\" Commander Feral growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!\" the villain said, drawing out the word.  \"I am here to have fun at the expense of everyone in the city.\"  He smirked as Commander Feral cocked his pistol, snarling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Not on my watch!\" he snarled.  Callie flipped open her pepper spray, ready to help in any way she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain took a silly pose.  \"I am here to rob all the men... fuck all the women... and learn how to do the Michigan Twist.\"  He began a weird, shuffling dance that served to make him look silly.  He then posed, and began to sing.  \"I'm here to steal every woman in the city!  'Cause I am a man who appreciates kitty titty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCallie's eyes widened in growing fear.  Commander Feral thought of his niece and opened fire, emptying the clip into the villain's face.  Every bullet bounced off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nice try,\" he said, snapping his fingers.  Feral's pistol turned into chocolate and melted.  Callie began scrambling for her SWAT Kats communicator, not caring that Manx and Feral... or at least Feral, as Manx had fled the moment the villain proved invincible... were watching.  The villain snapped his fingers again, and Callie's jacket and shirt burst open, exposing her breasts.  Callie yelped and covered herself, Feral tossing her his coat and snarling, charging in to punch the villain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe villain teleported out of the way, laughing as he flew off into the distance.  He'd made his presence known.  Soon, Megakat City would belong to him...</span></div></div>",

She found the ritual in a moldering box tucked away in the back corner of the basement of the bookstore where she slaved away for little reward. Half buried amongst the trash, she found the little stained book that would change her life beyond compare. The faded and peeling text on the cracked spine was in some language she couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of. Even looking online provided nothing close to the weird lettering if that was even what it was. Regardless of that, English text filled the inside of the book. Though the text there seemed to shift and crawl across the yellowed pages as she watched, and the odd style made it difficult though not impossible to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne constant part in the middle of the pages though, described a ritual. One that was far simpler than she was expecting. She figured it was a gag despite the oddity of the rest of the book. She figured it wouldn\u2019t do anything, but it would be good for a laugh. So that night after work, she rounded up the ingredients and other parts for the ritual and performed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she expected, nothing happened. She gave a laugh, tossed the book back in a bag to return it the next day and cleaned up before getting to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew something happened while she slept, but she couldn\u2019t remember much. She encountered\u2026something. Something sealed away, trapped between dimensions before the universe was even born. Its form was impossible to comprehend, and its \u201cvoice\u201d\u2014if it could be called that\u2014crashed over her and almost drowned her in power. One part stuck with her though, the being made a deal with the young woman. She would be free to do as she wished across the whole of the fabric of reality, and in return it would receive a break from the utter monotony and boredom of its existence. It then passed a small glowing orb from its immeasurable bulk and into her. Her body blazed with the incalculable power, for more than a human could ever hope to contain, but she was no longer human, even if she may have looked like it until she decided otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature vanished back to from whence it came to enjoy the show, she was left alone. Back in her cramped apartment like nothing had changed. She could tell how much had changed though. With nary a thought, she could see the total expanse of the infinite multiverse stretching out around her. Realities upon realities, infinite variations of worlds that were thought to be only fiction in the one she started from. And in all of them, she could see the multitude of beautiful women she had lusted after for so long. They would be hers; she would make sure of that. The power within her grasp would allow her to do so with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her focus to one collection of worlds to start with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So many animated men jto enslave, so little time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind made up, she decided to start her collection in Disney's expansive library. Gesturing, she made a 'grid' of sorts out of the multiverse. Moving it around like she was using a cell phone screen, flicking with her fingers, she eventually came across something surprising. A nexus of worlds, all connected to Disney. The world of Kingdom Hearts was loosely connected to these worlds, as were the worlds of Marvel and Star Wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, the Nexus was in the same triple-circle Mickey Mouse head shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain shook her head, shaking her head. She gestured again, and began looking through alternates. She didn't want to affect any 'primary canon' world, not knowing if it would affect the shows/comics/etc. her world knew, but she wanted to be as close as canon as possible with her collection. So she looked for settings where the differences from canon were superficial (they chose something else for lunch one day, for example). She found an acceptable variant world rather quickly. She started to enter the Nexus... and bounced off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What the fuck,\" the villain said, looking confused. She pressed on the Disney Nexus's surface, feeling powerful resistance. \"...You dare,\" she growled, feeling outraged. She began to beat on the Nexus, calling on more and more of her power to break through as her eyes and fists began to glow. \"I won't be stopped! I WON'T!\" With a final flaring punch, she tore a hole in the Nexus. Working her fingers into it, she roared, yanking open a tearing a massive hole in the Nexus and stepping through. She fired her power at the hole, cauterizing it and locking it open. \"Mine...\" she growled, looking towards the worlds. She took a moment to calm herself down, and coughed. \"Okay. Let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to leave Star Wars, Kingdom Hearts, and Marvel alone for now, she decided towards the primary Disney Nexus.
