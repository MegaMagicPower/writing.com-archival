Well, normal to most as secretly to most normal people, the Holy Grail War was under way as The magi and their servant's continue their fight's to obtain the holy grail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much time had passed since Archer was defeated by Berserker and Beserker was defeated by Shiro and Saber. Ilya was now staying at Shiro's home with him, Saber, and Rin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was a normal day to them and with Taiga's antic's and Sakura cooking a bigger meal for them all due to Saber being able to eat large amount's of food, unknown to them, they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster Was watching them through her crystal ball and smirked some as she focused the vision mostly on Saber and Ilya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have the girl and i must find a way to put Saber out of commission before it is too late. With Berserker defeated now, She remain's to be my biggest threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched them through the crystal ball, Caster noticed something. She had noticed how much food Saber has been eating when she soon got a idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfect. I shall turn her own gluttony against her. I shall place a curse on her where her hunger shall take over and no matter how much she eat's, she shall never be full. With her mind focused on filling her stomach, defeating her will be simple once she is immobile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was Said, Caster held her hand over the Crystal ball and cast the curse on Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Eat Saber. Eat as if it was your last day on this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thought never did cross Caster's mind as she had placed the curse on Saber and that was a limit. Since there was no limit placed, who know's what'll happen to Saber with a curse as powerful as that one placed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.............</span></div></div>",

As a king, Saber was accustomed to having an entire staff of servants to cook for her. And while Shirou was a far more skilled chief than all her previous servants, he couldn't possible hope to outproduce them all by himself. Thus, Saber now found herself facing a bit more of a delay than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as a king, Saber would never lower herself to the point of admitting her impatience or even allowing it to show on her face. Still Shirou could feel her silently willing him to make haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be so bad, but for the fact that Shirou now found himself preparing more and more. Saber would never say anything, but Shirou could see the subtle signs that she wanted more. The way her portions always grew just a little bit each meal, and the faint gleam of disappointment the flickered in her eyes for just a moment when she finished. And yet, even as Shirou steadily increased the size of each meal, they never had any leftovers, and the plates were all but licked clean. Shirou didn't mind the extra work though, he was always happy to see someone enjoy his cooking so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the first of many dishes, Shirou turned to begin setting the table and saw Saber . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arturia wakes up feeling groggy; slowly she remembers how she got knocked out. She remembers that she was fighting an Assassin class servant with a strange arm before the Servant managed to avoid her attack and she was slowly absorbed by a strange dark portal. As her green eyes adjust to the darkness, she notices she is in a cave large enough to store several houses. She is also strapped to what seems to be a chair if could be called that. The reason why is the black chair felt\u2026alive somehow. She felt a rumble beneath it similar to that off a pulse. Suddenly she hears a sound of something opening and closing then the sounds of footsteps. Could it be Assassin?<br>\r\nTrying to stand, Arturia Pendragon finds that she barely the strength to do so. Her mana must have been drained! Deciding to save her remaining energy, Saber sits back down waiting for the owner of the footsteps to come closer. Finally, the form comes closer and it is someone she recognized as soon as she saw the person\u2019s face.<br>\r\n\u201cSakura? Is that you?\u201d Saber says in astonishment. The girl that clung to her Master looked like a completely different person. Her long purple hair was now white as snow and her eyes were crimson, Instead of the normal clothes the knight was used to seeing her in she was wearing was black with red veins the dress however failed to cover her legs and spread out like cut strips of paper. She was wearing no shoes, walking toward Saber barefooted.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Saber, or should I say Arturia Pendragon?\u201d Even the girl\u2019s meekness has disappeared. In its place there was confidence. Saber was surprised at her new name being revealed just as much the change to Sakura\u2019s appearance. It takes the faithful knight a few seconds to process what\u2019s going on before speaking.<br>\r\n\u201cI am correct to assume you are Assassin\u2019s Master, Sakura?\u201d Saber assumes and Sakura nods, not surprised by the knight\u2019s deduction skills. \u201cThen why am I still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber is wondering why she is still alive. If Sakura still wanted the Grail she would need to cull the competition so why was she still here in this plane of existence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggles at Saber\u2019s question as if she asked why the sky was blue,\u201d As you know Assassin class servants are not very strong and Berserker is a very strong Servant. It would stand to reason I would require a very strong Servant as well wouldn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think I would betray my Master and Serve you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know how loyal you are to Senpai,\u201d Sakura says with a cruel smile. \u201cBut I need you, the Grail needs you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Grail has chosen you as its host Saber.\u201d Sakura continues as if she is hailing a prophet from on high. \u201cOnly you can give birth to it. When you do your whole world will change, trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive birth? What are you saying?!\u201d Saber spouts as she forces herself to stand. But it takes all her strength to stand, she cannot approach Sakura yet alone take a step or else she will fall flat on her face. Has Sakura lost it? The Holy Grail is an object not a thing of flesh and using her to grow it? Barbaric!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura approaches Arturia and lightly pushes her. That is all it takes for the knight to fall back down on the black chair which now has red pulsing veins running through it. Saber tries to raise her arms but finds they are now stuck like glue to the chair. Her clothes and armor are not only stuck to it but her skin, her entire arm, her entire body is stuck like glue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaku<b>-UMP</b>!\u201dBefore Arturia can say anything a black sludge similar in color as the chair enters her mouth. The taste is vile and bitter, tasting like corruption itself! Sakura smiles as Saber is forced to swallow the sludge, caressing her face as the chair slowly covers her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry when you wake up, you will feel absolutely refresh. I promise.\u201d Sakura say as Saber\u2019s green eyes are covered and leaving her blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Some time later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber was trapped in a void filled with endless suffering, endless violence, and the eternal evil of mankind. It was there that she learned the truth. The world was evil and disgusting. Her end was just another stepping stone for that evil, why do it all over again only for the cycle to repeat itself?<br>\r\nIt needed to be restarted and be born anew. She, Arturia Pendragon, would be the one to do by giving birth to a new life that was far superior to any foolish human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Arturia\u2019s black and veiny cocoon that she was entrapped in slowly started to come apart piece by piece as Saber\u2019s new form showed itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sliver armor, once pure and simple was now black, heavy and bulky. Her armored gauntlets now were similar. Her blue gown she loved was now tainted black. Her green eyes were now yellow and bloodthirsty. Bu Sakura was right, she did indeed feel refreshed more alive with a grand new purpose:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo give birth to Angra Mainyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber still in sitting in her new throne, sees Sakura who was now kneeling before her. \u201cMy Queen, how are feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber smiles after taking in the air as if truly breathing for the first time, \u201cLike a brand new person and\u2026.\u201d The black knight touches her armor, where her navel is located. There was nothing noticeable there but a mother knows when she is expecting. \u201cMy child is demanding nutrition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, should we head out now?\u201d Sakura asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber considers her options as her stomach rumbles. Her child is hungry; while she could eat mundane human food she knows would not be enough to fully nourish her developing child. It would require the energy of other servants and perhaps their Masters to help the child grow. Also looking around the cave, Saber notices how dreary it is, if she was to have a child they would require a more suitable place worthy of a queen. Perhaps she should take over the shrine above them, which Caster used to reside in before being killed by her hands and expel those monks residing it? There are not many servants whom could take her on currently so perhaps she should just charge ahead? It might be better to try and satisfy her child for now with human souls for now and have Sakura and Assassin scout the situation.<br>\r\nComing to a decision, the queen decides to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However for first time since she was summoned in Chaldea, she didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has fallen in love. Not like the marriage to Gwen, mind you, but an actual boy, her Master to be more precise. Every time Arturia heard his voice, touched her, or even looked directly at her, her heart would pound fiercely against her chest making her want to fling herself on her Master. However as the King of Knights it would reflect poorly on herself and her people to act to this way so she keeps herself in check while enjoying her Master's company. Lately though,  the Master has been avoiding her...while spending time with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering from the corner, Saber watches her Master as he talks to her other older and more sexy self. This is herself as a Lancer, contaminated by the World's Evils of the Holy Grail and King of the Wild Hunt. A Lancer without peer and skill and size dare she say. She stands there wearing straight leotard that squeezes her curves, hips and her breasts all the while leaving her stomach bare, showing off the tight and thin stomach. The Master continually stares at those udders barely contained as her Lancer Alter self looks on unresponsive, neither enjoying it nor hating it as they speak to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That harlot is tempting Master.\" Arturia grips the walls tightly with her armored hands, the only leash keeping her from lashing out. Her other hand goes to her armored chest. The smooth and almost flat surface reminding her of the cost of holding Excalibur. She never had a chance to be a woman or anything else. The one chance she does have is being taken by herself of all things! No longer able to stand the sight Arturia grunts as she walks away. The only evidence of her being there is the chunk of wall she was holding onto, cracked and broken as small pieces fall away.</span></div></div>",

Even as the turbulent winds of Invisible Air dispel, exposing Excalibur in it's radiant glory, the King of Knights can scarcely believe her orders as light accumulates within her blade. Eyes color the finest of emeralds widen in surprise, and dread as she finds her body obeying the will of the Command Seal. The realization of what is about to happen made the blonde begin to struggle with all her might. Her body cries out in agony over the conflicting need to resist/obey as Saber's own willpower and Magic Resistance fight against a power than can instill something close to an absolute miracle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Is it when your absolute best is still not enough?</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Kiritsugu-Why this? WHY THIS?!\" The blonde cries out even as she is force to raise her blade overhead. At this point, it would be consider a miracle upon itself that the young woman hasn't brought her sword down already. Despite her slender figure, torrents of pain lash across her form as she struggles against Kiritusugu's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite the intense pain, Saber could only look at her <i>true</i> Master in shock. Her mind trying and failing to rationalize it. She knew of her Master's desire for the grail. Why, at the end, does he choose now to reject it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment it is just the two of them. Herself and Kiritsugu. Tearing green eyes look into dull black. She heard the indignant shouts of Archer, something about a wedding, but she didn't care about that. All she can do is just look Kiritsugu straight in the eye with a pleading look. Even in the slight crimson glow of the Command Seals illuminates the Magus Killer's visage, Saber cannot read the stone wall look on the man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees the man speak once more, and Saber can feel reality come crashing down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saber, I command you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or is to watch all that you have worked for be reduced to dust by someone you considered an ally?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-destroy the grail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber's efforts crumbles immediately. Kiritsugu's final order combined with the crushing presence of a second Command Seal demolishes the King of Knights in an instant. Her arms strikes downward, unleashing Excalibur's full might at the golden chalice. Radiant prana lashes forward, vaporizing the Holy Grail almost instantaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight, wondrously despite it's destruction, is made unknown as Saber merely closes her eyes. The last strike enough to exhaust her remaining mana, soon her physical form will disappear into nothingness. All she can do know is quietly think on how badly she fail to understand even a single person. From the people she led as a king, to the knights who swore fealty to her, even the lone man she could only scarcely understand from just three orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were he final thoughts as Saber, known by the many to be King Arthur, disappears into nothingness. Unaware of what is to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It would be at this point did the one known as Artoria Pendragon would vanish upon modern day Fuyuki City. She would then return upon the blood soaked hills of Camlann Hill. Surrounded by the corpses of those she once called allies, even right next to her \"son\" Mordred. The sight alone would reduce Artoria to tears and soon harden her resolve for the Grail, though this time not to redo her rule but to replace herself entirely. Then on she would then be summoned into the Fifth Grail War by the son of the very man she was betrayed by. From there on the Servant Saber will find out the truth of the Holy Grail and either find love in the strangest of people, find peace with her self and fade away into history, or be corrupted until death puts her out of her misery.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>However fate is fluid. Those outcomes are merely a drop in the sea of infinite possibilities that can only be traversed by the Kaleidoscope. In those reflections, Saber merely disappears without a word. In another she merely lets out a quiet thought. A sudden desire. A wish.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If only I can disappear.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And soon her fate would spiral into a loop of insanity that seeks to keep her lock inside forever.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I can disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtoria did not know what brought that thought on. Literally she is already disappearing into nothingness. Soon she would fade from the world, the common man unaware or unknowing of her presence. A mere flicker of light that is soon snuff out like a flame from a candle's wick. Already she can feel Excalibur's light washing out meager existence. She would \"die\" and soon return to that hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" A sudden epiphany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King of Knights is almost gone. Only a bit of her head and the tears that fell down her face are left. Even then she would soon disappear as Kiritsugu's order runs its course. Yet still, despite everything, there is some part of her is alive. With what little willpower she has left she speaks out a childish desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo disappear into nothingness. Free of pain. Free of failures. Free of all that has plagued her life. It was a childish in a way. To no longer carry the burden she place upon her shoulders, and simply fade away and just let all the suffering wash off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber soon vanishes into the ether, and is soon no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet something, somewhere has heard her final words...<b>and stirs.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber, no, Artoria wakes up to the sight wooden ceiling. Green eyes, open wide in shock, as she finds herself staring up at a ceiling of a room she has no recollection of being in. Even more shocking, the aches of pains of her last encounter with Archer and Kiritsugu's betrayal were entirely gone beyond a faint phantom pain. If she be more aware, the blonde young woman would have notice that her clothes and armor are unblemished, pristine as if new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that all, Saber rockets straight upward. She whips her head back and forth at her new surroundings, an unassuming classroom with a couch she was laying on, trying to rationalize what has happen to her. Everywhere she look she saw no signs of tampering, or traps, or even some sort of magical energy. It was an mundane classroom, sans the couch instead of desks and chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the King of Knights can help but feel everything is just <u>wrong</u>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtoria did not know how she came into this space. Taking a few deep breaths to calm her nerves she voices the most obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the result of your wish my adorable King of Knights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde's heart freezes at the new, and yet familiar, voice. Slowly turning behind her, at the room's entrance, Saber sees someone she fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irisviel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, the Einzbern homunculus gives a radiant smile. Though dress in a pink hakama and having her white hair in a pony tail there was no denying the individual before bears the physical body of Irisviel von Einzbern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet for some reason Saber finds herself on edge. Instinct born of countless battles have hone her senses. Even with the recent despair of what just happen Saber finds herself ready to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Don't be deceived.'</i> Her instincts warn her. <i>'Do not trust her, or you will suffer.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomaching the fresh pain of betraying her recent friend, Artoria hardens her heart and raises Excalibur at the other woman. \"Identify yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irisviel\" is actually unperturbed at the development. She merely smiles wider, \"I am Irisiviel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber steps forward, ready to fight. \"Don't deceive me, you may wear her face but you are not her. Identify yourself imposter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, \"Irisiviel\" smiles, \"Ah, how cute. Very well, I am Irisviel, and yet I am not her. In a way I am merely your guide for this space born of your wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber raises an eyebrow, \"My wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrisviel's nods, \"Yes, you wish to disappear did you not. To be free of the shackles that bind and plague you. Well your wish has been heard and thus here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion crosses Artoria's face as she lowers Excalibur. \"That...should be impossible.\" The outcome of the Grail War was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the little details Artoria-chan!\" Irisviel speaks up, making her way closer. Artoria herself didn't react as the \"imposter\" pushes Excalibur away from her. \"In this space, anything is possible now. Though disappearing sounds a bit too much, you can just stay in here forever if you want. All you have to do is just accept your new home.\" Irisviel sounds holds out her hound to Artoria, as if greeting a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber soon goes from confusion to hesitation, \"Forever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrisviel grins, \"Yep, here, forever. No more King's burdens, no more bad memories, just you and me to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber looks at the offering hand, to her sword, and then down at her feet. Part of her wanted to accept, she was a failure as a king, why did she need to continue pressing the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she also feels that something is wrong. There's something is amiss and if she takes \"Irisviel's\" hand it's all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to her image of her friend's radiant smile, Artoria comes to a decision.</span></div></div>",

While she does respect  Irisviel and thinks of her as a dear friend she has no obligation to be kind to this fake even though something stirs her to at least respectfully decline this being\u2019s offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry but I cannot accept that offer. Even if I do wish to disappear I still have responsibilities to take care of, things to do.\u201d Artoria says to \u201cIrisviel\u201d with a sad smile. The person in front of her just looked confused and slowly she shakes her head with a smile as if to forget what Artoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Is that what you really want? You sure you want this?\u201d The false Irisviel asks innocently. Saber almost wants to disagree with what she just said. But she has to stand firm get out of here and fix her mistakes eve if she wants none of the responsibilities any longer. Saber nods her head as Irisviel\u2019s red eyes start to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but why? WHY?\u201d Irisviel starts to pout as she falls to her knees just like a child would when they threw a tantrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIrisviel\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Saber says as she walks past the white haired woman with a guilty look as she went toward the door hoping to find an exit to this school and so she does not have to see her friend\u2019s tears even if it is not really her. Before Saber could get far however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2019m sorry Saber\u2026I won\u2019t let you. If you don\u2019t want to stay, I will have to make you<b> STAY</b>!\u201d As the false being roars a fierce wind blows, destroying the windows behind her and even with the armor to weigh her down Artoria was easily blown off her feet and grab the floor as the wall where the door is easily destroyed showing a deep void. The couch and wooden roof were easily blown away and thrown off the ledge leaving only Saber, Irisviel, and a blackboard in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Suddenly Saber finds one of her gauntlets fall away just like they are sand. An instant later the next one follows along with her other pieces of her armor revealing the callous hands, her nearly flat chest and her leather boots. Without the metal armor helping her stay aground, Artoria finds herself slowly being dragged to the edge despite using all her power to stay in place. <br>\r\nSomehow Irisviel was not affected by the wind and effortlessly made her way toward the knight. Her smile now cold and unforgiving. After all, Artoria did deny her meaning of existence and her reason for being here. \u201cArtoria-chan. You look like you\u2019re having trouble with the wind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou! Stop this immediately and let me go!\u201dSaber calls out with a harsh command as she is only a foot away from the ledge somehow holding fast. This confirms that this being was not her friend despite having the same personality. Irisveil was never this powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Artoria, the being was able to easily speak over the turbulent winds as she stopped in front of Saber and crouched like a little girl admiring some kind of ant looking directly into the knight\u2019s green eyes. The harsh yet kind look sent an involuntary chill down Artoria\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never understood why you wear such\u2026.things Artoria-chan.\u201d The false Irisveil says as she looks over Artoria\u2019s blue gown and leather boots with slight disgust as she snaps her fingers. \u201cIf you stayed here you could wear anything and no one would care. Like something like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtoria felt her clothing tear just at her hips as her legs started to feel the cold winds as her gown shortens in length ending just at her thighs. Her sleeves darkened to a dark blue as well as the rest of her clothing. A red ribbon suddenly grows out of her outfit and blows onto her chin. Her collar also grows out somewhat till it touches her shoulder but still does not show any skin despite the blowing wind. She feels a strange weight on her left shoulder only to see a brown school bag now resting there.<br>\r\nArtoria is now wearing a dark blue school uniform. Irisveil seemed pleased with her handiwork despite Artoria\u2019s leering glare. Her glare changes into shock however as the ground holding her slowly disappears. The white being floats a few inches in the air perhaps showing the former knight how fultile it would be to go against her.<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully if you spend some time here you\u2019ll love and stare here\u2026.with me forever. Please enjoy yourself for now my lovely Artoria-chan.\u201d Irisviel pats Artoria\u2019s cheek much like a lover would and peels her fingers off the ledge. With a roar of defiance, Artoria the schoolgirl is blown away as everything turns dark after the blackboard falls off the wall and blows directly into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later Artoria wakes up to see a completely wooden ceiling. Jumping out of the soft and warm bed she was lying in, Artoria looks around for the fake Irisviel.  Thinking it was just some weird dream Saber notices her legs are cold and sees that she was wearing a dark blue skirt insuring her that this is no dream.<br>\r\n\u201cI see so that actually happened.\u201d Saber mutters as she looks around. The room was completely wooden while there was a glass window she could not see out of it. There was no furniture as well. The only thing different was a large wooden door leading outside. On a desk her new schoolbag was resting along with Excalibur which was wrapped with a dark blue cloth and tied with a red string. She tried to remove the concealed sword from the cloth but for some reason finds that it cannot be removed no matter how hard she tires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exploring the surrounding area Artoria does not find any other doors at all, not even a closet door. There is no way to open the windows and Artoria fears that even if she wanted to the window near the bed would not break no matter how hard she tried.\u201c So this is my only way out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtoria knows that if she stays in one place she will never leave so going through the door is a good idea for now. Despite picking up Excalibur she finds that she can\u2019t go far without also taking her schoolbag making her annoyed. Inside the bag is miscellaneous stuff a girl in high school would have note books, pencils, and even a small stuff lion that Artoria would admit was cute. Opening the door she finds herself in\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the door closed behind the King now schoolgirl, she hears a loud click and the large wooden door somehow blending in with the wall, trapping her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s fine with Artoria though, she wants to move forward and leave this place not head backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe classroom is the same as she last saw it except for some small differences. The couch she found herself lying on upon awakening in this place is gone and replaced by two desks made for students\u2026much like her. They stand in front of the blackboard signaling that this place is a classroom. However, the warrior inside Artoria does not buy it one bit and examines the place floor to ceiling. Yet she finds nothing of worth. The windows neither have locks or ways to open and there is not a door in sight.  Even the drawers and other storage places are shut tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you planning to keep me here till I finally agree to join you, Irisveil?\u201d Artoria huffs in frustration at her \u201cfriend\u201d.  \u201cThink again as I will not stay here. So let me leave already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the king hears the sound of chalk hitting the blackboard. Curious, she approaches the blackboard and finds writing similar to that of Irisviel\u2019s on it,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><i><b>\u201cRiddle me this Artoria-chan, What thing does a woman most desire? After you chose your answer please sit in your assigned seat.</b></i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\nAs soon as the King finishes reading the question the two desk light up as words etch themselves on their surface. The one on the right says \u201cHer Will\u201d while the one on the left says \u201cHer beauty\u201d. Artoria cannot help but give a scoff at this riddle as it is one from her time. A baron threatened war upon her and her kingdom if she could not solve the riddle, this very same riddle. Gawain, one of her knights was one who managed to find the answer. However\u2026.which one was the answer again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is too easy.\u201d Thought the king now schoolgirl as she sits in\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each of them competed who was most beautiful therefore it should be this chair she should sit in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtoria sits in the seat with a smug expression on her face at this surprisingly simple riddle. This thing that has taken her friends appearance must be pretty-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a large alarm goes off causing Artoria to jump to her feet\u2026.if she could. Before her butt could even leave the seat the wood stretches, covering her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOFFF!\u201d The school girl says as she almost gives herself whiplash. Before she could recover and attempt  fling her legs the floor seems to be like mud  and cover her shoes and ankles holding her legs in place! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat trickery is this?! Release me now!\u201d Artoria yells as she tries break free but finds out she can\u2019t! How? With her strength she should easily be able to escape\u2026.that is if this place was controlled by common sense. Unfortently it\u2019s controlled by this Iriveil so currently her strength is only that of a girl her age, not a dragon\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on the restiants with her hands, the female king hears the scratching of the black board as more words are written,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u201c Unfortently Artoria-chan the correct answer is her will. You should know that as a girl yourself! Did you learn anything? Well, looks like you will have to be punished!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</b></i>If Artoria was able to focus on anything but the words on the blackboard or her current predictiment she would have noticed the large, black, elastic tube that is creeping down the ceiling like a snake waiting for a chance to kill it\u2019s prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPunished, I am not a child in need o-<b>OMPH</b>!\u201d Is all the King can get out before the tube strikes forcing itself in her mouth. It goes close to her esophagus almost making her gag before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde fights with the tube, desperately trying to free her mouth from the abhorrent elastic taste. Suddenly, she fills a sharp warm pinch in her butt cheeks! With the tube still in her mouth, the king had to use her hands to see for her, some kind of thin round object  is near her behind pressing tightly against her buns! After several moments Artoria find that struggling is usless, the board starts writing again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Of course Artoria-chan, you are no child but a grown woman, a petite woman, but still- a woman. Sheesh, how you could get this answer wrong is beyond me! Now, since you are a big girl it\u2019s only fair you choose your punishment.

No, perhaps this a gimmick a fake out perhaps if she waits-<br>\r\nThree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous, but I have to hurry or else something far worse could happen to me.\u201d Artoria cringes as she thinks quickly on which button to chose.

Though the pose looks comical with a pipe crammed into her mouth and the school girl clothes, it signifies how much she doesn\u2019t care for this bluff. There is no way that this being that has taken on her friend\u2019s form can modify a servant\u2019s body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDo your worse imposter!\u201d</i> the petite woman screams in her mind fully intent to face this problem head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith strong confidence that this all is just a bluff, the blonde knight stares down the last few preious seconds on the large clock. Once the number hits zero a large blaring sound resounds throughout the classroom making Artoria cover her ears unless she wants to go deaf. The sheer noise itself forces the king to close her eyes or her eyeballs just might jump out of their sockets! The surrounding glass windows have shattered spraying their broken contents on the wooden floor. After four more seconds though the meaningless noise stops, allowing Artoria to open her eyes, the first thing she sees is the blackboard with new writing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\u201cI gave you a chance Artoria-chan. Now be ready to bear the <u>consequence!</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i></b><i>\u201cConsequence? I already look stupid in this situation. What else can you possib-\u201c </i> The school girl\u2019s thoughts are cut short as a heated prick of a needle touches both her butt cheeks. A grunt of surprise exits Artoria\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the warmth continues on her buttocks, a thin stream of liquid exits the black plastic tube in the blondes mouth, with no way to spit it out Artoria lets her reflexes take over and let herself swallow the liquid. The liquid honestly tasted good like a juice mixture of fruits the blonde cannot help but note as she continues to swallow, her throat bobbing up and down as she performs this action. It is than that the king notices something disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer underwear feels tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Artoria\u2019s emerald eyes widen in undeniable shock, her butt is expanding. Bit by bit her arse grows, her thighs and hips being forced to take in the increase in fat and weight. Her stockings feel increasingly tight on her skin as dig into her body. Her dark blue skirt, only able to cover so much quickly loses to her increasing bulk as her panties peek out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThis is impossible!\u201d </i>Artoria screams in her mind as tries to escape once more. However the bounds around her waist seem to be tighter then before making it more impossible for her escape. Once her flesh seems to barely escape the seat do the needles withdraw making the knight notice her other problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the fuilds going into her stomach it has expanded immensely so much so that the shirt covering her has become tight. Just when Artoria thought she was going to burst out of her clothes the stream of juice flavor liquid stops. Sigh in some relief, the king turned schoolgirl is grateful when the thing holding her waist lets go letting her fully see the damage as she stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooohhh\u2026.Urp\u2026full.\u201d The blonde cannot help but groan as a burp leaks out. Thanks to her shirt, the mass called her stomach does not bob as much but the sloshing liquid makes it uncomfortable. Also her ass\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis has to be a nightmare.\u201d Artoria murmurs as stares in shock. Her butt was once fully covered by the skirt she was forced to wear but now it could only cover half, showing off the black panties she is wearing to the outside world. The saber servant can barely see past her bloated stomach but her thighs are definitely thicker by the way the stockings are clinging as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully you learned your lesson about women Artoria-chan.\u201d The fake Iri\u2019s voice echo through the classroom as the door opens.\u201d Please, keep proving me right.\u201d'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cProving you right?\u201d</i> Artoria cannot help but think. What\u2019s that suppose to mean? Nevertheless Artoria must continue onward. With small groans and a few escaped burps the blond hobbles towards the door unused to her new bulk.<br>\r\nAs she walks through the door Artoria finds herself in\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blonde young woman gives a brief glance to the disappearing motes of light of Excalibur before looking at the sparkling expression of her soon to be sole companion. Biting down the lingering grief Artoria gives a slight smile, \"Perhaps I should stay here, for a while at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my adorable King of Knights I'm glad you accept this!\" To the blonde woman's surprise, the pink clad homunculus springs forward before wrapping her arms around her. Artoria's world became a slight blur as she and her...friend spun around in a sense of celebration. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure you won't regret this at all!\" The spinning continue for a few rotations before Irisviel slows to a stop before the two of them finds themselves plopping down on the couch. Irisviel laughs with girlish glee as Artoria herself gives a faint chuckle at the faint sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's suppose to warm the King of Knights' heart to see Irisviel laugh again. It <i>should</i> make her heart feel at ease to find her friend smiling and laughing again before...everything. Yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'You're being deceived!'</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'Run! Fight! Hide!'</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'THIS ISN'T REAL!'</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'ENOUGH!'</i> The King of Knights clamps down on her hesitation with an iron grip. This space, this realm, is her home now. She has failed her realm, her people, her friends. All because that she was King and failed miserably at that task. She won't go back to that blood soaked hill. Not again...NEVER AGAIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concern tone of Irisviel makes Saber, no, correction Artoria snap out of her inner turmoil before looking at her friend with a strain smile. \"I'm sorry, Irisviel. It's nothing really and I'm no longer Saber. You can call me Artoria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot King Arthur, or Arthur Pendragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd especially not the King of Knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Artoria.\" The blonde young woman speaks with a sense of finality. Her past, the actions of the King of Knights now no longer applies to her. Excalibur will no longer enter her grip. She will no longer burden the world more with her mistakes. Now she's here, with a friend, in a space that could be best described as limbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring, or perhaps accepting of her friend's plight, Irisviel clasps her hands together in joy and gives a radiant smile. \"Okay, Artoria it is then, and you can keep calling me Irisviel in exchange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as though the weight of her sins no longer on her shoulders, Artoria leans back on the couch and ponders. Another flex of will and mana forged armor and gauntlets disappear, leaving her in nothing but the blue dress, the last remainder of her prior identity. She should ask Irisviel for a change of clothes later, something feminine this time instead of the dark suit she wore previous. But...\"So what's first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back up Artoria looks at her friend with slight anticipation. \"So what do we do first, since we're now together in this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's a good point.\" Irisiviel looks up a bit as she ponders what to do. A beat later and a flash of inspiration crosses her face, \"A party!\" Seeing the blonde young woman's look of confusion the homunculus takes Artoria's hands in hers. \"Think of this as a celebration of your new life here! We can have games, food, and a bunch of fun stuff you didn't have during your time. True parties are usually with more people, but I bet with the two of us that'll be more than enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtoria allows herself to slightly wider smile as she tries to share in Irisviel's enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>'You can still turn back.'</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Enough.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Artoria accepts her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Irisiviel,\" the no longer King of Knights calls out to her friend, \"So what do we need for this party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another good point.\" Irisiviel thinks to herself again before smiling once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Saber had been captured by Caster back on the Fuyuki bridge when protecting Shirou and Rin from a sudden ambush. With a force of will Saber managed to give the two Masters enough time to escape. Now she was stuck in the Basement of this church in a humiliating white dress with her enemy! Forced in a humiliating position with her hands bound by magic, her upper body pulled forward while her butt pointed outward, Saber growled as Caster approached.<br>\r\n\"Ara Saber, do you want to disappear? Don't you wish to have the Holy Grail?\" Caster watched in amusement at the sheen of sweat on Saber's white and fair skin added to Saber's beauty. The witch licks her lips as Saber bit her lips in order to appear defiant.<br>\r\n\"I refuse to follow you witch!\" Saber glared at caster. Many feared her glare but Caster only smiled more knowing that Saber currently was all bark and no bite. \" My loyalty is to my Master not you!\"<br>\r\n\"Still holding to hope for your previous master will come to save you? Such a modern fairy tale of knights and princesses isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"S-say what you will.\" Saber stutters as her legs shake not from fear but excursion. if she does not get mana soon she will disappear. Caster, enjoying her stolen Servant\u2019s turmoil, had a very interesting idea regarding that issue. A simple spell but one that might let saber struggle longer. Caster took several steps toward her prisoner who watched with a tired gaze. Caster caresses Saber face seductively removing the thin layer of sweat as the knight moves slightly of her touch. With a gloved finger, Caster traces along Saber's back causing said servant to tremble from disgust. Finally the hand finds its way to Saber's butt.<br>\r\n\"What are you- unhand me!\" Saber shakes her hips only adding to the allure. Caster begins to chant a spell and Saber fills something cold yet familiar being put though her. Looking behind herself, Saber saw Caster lifting her hand away from underneath her dress. \u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just gave you the necessary mana to sustain yourself, but, if you refuse to accept it you might find yourself a bit\u2026..bloated.\u201d Caster then giggles at Saber\u2019s confused look before walking outside the room.<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, Saber enjoys the quiet thinking of some way to release her bounds and make Caster pay for the humiliations. Suddenly she feels a cold feeling as Caster\u2019s mana tries to force itself in her being. With a small groan Saber refuses it only to feel full as if she ate one of Shirou\u2019s meals. Shrugging off the feeling, Saber waits for an oppurity to free herself.<br>\r\nWhat Saber failed to realize is that each time she refuses Caster\u2019s mana it would fill her up-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Again she feels something pressing against her stomach, if she could move she would notice her stomach, once lean and fit had grown in a slight paunch pushing slightly against her dress. It would be barely noticeable if one looked hard enough. <br>\r\nThe King of Knights, trying to stay energetic looked around the room for escape routes or places to hid. There was no one present except her on the altar and several pillars most likely used to balance the floor above her where Caster and her Master are currently at.<br>\r\nMoving her head toward the Altar she notices there is a doorway leading up, to where she does not know where but it is a different one where Caster comes from. As she moves, Saber\u2019s sweat drips off her brow and damp blond hair depositing to the floor along with various other drops in a small puddle. Her dress that she forced to wear is partially see though allowing one to see though somewhat.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Saber drops to the floor.<br>\r\n\u201cUmp!\u201d Saber grunts as she pulls herself from the floor ignoring the indignity of her fall. \u201cWhat\u2026.is the \u2026meaning of\u2026this?\u201d<br>\r\nStreching her hearing Saber can hear faint sounds of fighting above her. Straining, the knight slowly stands up, takes a few hesitant steps on high heels before being forced to lean against the altar to catch her breath. Considering her options slowly, Saber considers running though the doorway leading from the altar. If she escapes she can try to make her way back to her Master and fix their pact. Another option would be to attack the support beams with her remaining mana perhaps assisting whoever was attacking Caster.<br>\r\nSaber summons her armor only for it to fade away the moment she calls it. Her sword is appears with the wind surrounding it as usual but feels heavier than usual. Looking like a damsel in distress forced to put up arms Saber feels Caster\u2019s mana try to invade her once more.<br>\r\n<b>\u201cMMM\u2026?!\u201d</b> Saber hums loudly pulling her hips together in effort as her stomach swell a few inches.

Enjoying the calming rain and knowing the area well and the way back to Shriou\u2019s house. Saber shakes her head, the cooling rain flying off her. It\u2019s best she does not go there, it\u2019s likely the first place Caster will look. Perhaps she should go to Rin\u2019s place instead?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRin\u2019s place seems to be the safer bet.\u201d Saber thought. Caster likely does not know the location but soon the witch will likely chase after her. Should Saber take the long way to throw her off? It seems to be the best option as-<br>\r\nSuddenly, Caster\u2019s mana invades Saber once more causing her to get on her hands and knees as her body trembles in her efforts to ignore it. Her body desperately wants the mana but her pride won\u2019t allow her to take it. As it passes Saber places a hand on her stomach and notices she touches far too soon.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Saber touches her stomach shocked to see it had formed into a small potbelly now. Saber stares at her inflated stomach for a moment before poking it find that her finger does not sink into the skin.

But refused to do so, if barely. Getting as far away as possible and getting to Rin\u2019s was the priority right now. But with her newfound curse, Saber considers taking a short route to Rin\u2019s. The sooner she gets rid of this\u2026aliment the better. But it still could make her easy to track. Saber sees two paths, the one on the left leads to a bus stop where she can take a quick ride to close to Rin\u2019s.

Thankfully even if it is night they seem to operate, she only has to wait a few minutes before a bus comes on. Once she boards, she remembers she has to pay in order to ride the bus. Dejected, she slowly climbs back down the stairs before the driver speaks to her. Realizing that she has no money, he still lets her ride despite it saying leaving a lady like her out in the rain. Thankful for the man\u2019s generosity she climbs aboard the chunk of metal and finds only herself plus a mother and her son aboard as well.<br>\r\nSitting near the door she came though, Saber thinks about what to do once she reaches her stop. Rin may see her as an enemy servant so she should prove herself otherwise lose a chance at freeing herself from Caster\u2019s control. She also noticed that her body has yet to feel caster\u2019s mana force itself in her either. Perhaps if she is lucky, she is out of reach of the spell inflating her. Thankfully the man either ignored or failed to notice Saber\u2019 pot belly.<br>\r\n\u201cMommy why is that lady wearing a dress?\u201d she hears the young boy question her mother. Seeing as she was wearing a dress, albeit a tight one around the stomach, he must be referring to her.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sweetie perhaps she is a princess?\u201d The mother whispered. Saber scowled at the comment. She was a knight not a damsel in distress!<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d the boy tries to leave his mother who grabs him.<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t bother her, Shin.\u201d The mother begins to scold. \u201cShe looks like she has had a rough day as tired as she looks.\u201d<br>\r\nThe boy looks displeased and sits down. Saber cannot help but sigh in relief. She rather not have any detours if she can help it.<br>\r\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t far off the mark.\u201d Saber thought as she presses all her  weight on the seat. Getting kidnapped and cursed, plus a faint supply of mana is far from rough. Once she gets to Rin\u2019s she might be able to take care of one of those problems at least.<br>\r\nSuddenly Arturia felt the same feeling when Caster\u2019s mana invades her body once more. She is forced to bite her lips so no moans escape her lips. Was it just her or was each time this happens\u2026it feels better and better? Her skin stretching, feeling warm. A good feeling if Saber was allowed to be honest. Realizing what she was thinking, Saber instantly pulled away from such thoughts. Surveying the damage, Saber could notice that her pot belly was truly noticeable now. The dress was truly tight around that area now more so then before. One could see a efinte curve to her stomach now as the dress was now skin tight around that area. The king of knights could only wonder in morbid curiosity on what would happen if this swelling continued.<br>\r\nAfter hakf an hour into the ride, the driver calls out the street where Rin\u2019s house is located, Saber rises out of her seat feeling at least somewhat better after being allowed to sit for a time. The mother notices her stomach and stares intently making Saber somewhat embarrassed. Once she got to the driver seat, the man extends a hand out stopping her.<br>\r\n\u201cListen,\u201d the man says solemnly as he stares at Saber\u2019s enlarged stomach. \u201c I don\u2019t know what happened to your boyfriend or why he ditched you. Well maybe a little bit but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Saber stares confused as the man coughs into his hand.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, er, that man who ditched you must be a true jerk to leave a lady in your condition out in the rain. If you ever need something or whatever just call.\u201d The man says awkwardly as he hands Saber a card. Still confused Arthuria can only nod as she exited the bus.  The rain had now stopped but now a thick fog was in the air. Watching he bus drive away, Saber realizes what the man was trying to say.<br>\r\nHe thought that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n\u201cR-really, I look like an expecting mother?\u201d Saber blushes crimson as she touches her gut. Her hands still did not sink into it but her hands felt somewhat warm to the touch as she rubbed it. Ridding her slef of her thoughts and feelings after a few moments to calm herself. Saber walked to Rin\u2019s place. With her still be mana deprived she had to rest a few times before finding herself leaning on Rin\u2019s mailbox gasping for breath.<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully Rin is here\u2026.I don\u2019t think I will be able to go much further this night without resting.\u201d Saber says as she feels her legs shaking. As Artoria walks to the door she notices there are no lights on but figures Rin may be hiding herself thanks to Caster\u2019s ambush. The blond knight knocks on the door-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Saber knocks on the door it slightly opens and becomes on guard.  The few times she has come to Rin\u2019s house she has always kept it locked. Something must have happened or perhaps due to her kidnapping Rin must have left to her Master\u2019s home to regroup. Rin is logical but it seems even she could be forgetful Saber thought. Still it never hurts to be catious, Saber manafesited her sword. Unfortently due to her exsuastion, the sword has bcome visable and her arm that carries it falls as she barely manages to keep from hitting the ground forcing her to hold it with two hands. Slowly, Arturia opens the door and steps inside the darkened house.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone home? Rin it\u2019s me.\u201d Saber calls out as she doesn\u2019t want Rin to suddenly attack her. Due to her forgetting her expanded stomach, Saber pinches it as she closes the door almost causing her to curse aloud. The seams around her stomach are starting to strain themselves as well. While the blond would love to change back into her battle attire currently it I impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber travels to the living room being careful not to make any noise as she quietly steps on the wooden floorboards. Listening carefully with her enhanced hearing, she hears no movements at all in fact Saber dares to think that Rin had forgot to lock the door of all things. Saber travels to the kitchen toward nearest lightswitch that she can remember in the dark. Feeling around, Saber manages to avoid stubbing her toe agsint the counter and hitting her stomach against the dining room table till she finally makes it to the lightswitch. The knight is temporary blinded as her green eyes adjust to the sudden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I thought,\u201d Saber says to herself no longer fearing a surprise attack.\u201dRin is not here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that, she was in someone\u2019s house without permission filled the Servant with shame but it was better than being outside currently. Also her current appearance is\u2026.<i>distracting</i> in its own way. Saber made her way to the living room her eyes wanted to close then and there once she saw a the couch. However Preparations needed to be made first. Looking down at her dripping wet dress she finds her first need, a change of clothes and the only way to find it was in Rin\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow shameful to steal clothing from an ally.\u201d The knight thought as she makes her way up to the second floor and enters Rin\u2019s room. Upon noticing the wardrobe Saber opens it and tries to find something that would contain her current bulge called her stomach. Right now it would be fair to say she looked at least several months pregnant or had gone to a buffet and ate a large amount of food. Saber has a feeling that the growth won\u2019t stop there either. She needs at least something that will stretch as her stomach grows. Throwing off her drenched dress but keeping the white lace underwear and bra on, <i>(Saber really did not think it polite to go though another\u2019s underwear.) </i>Saber put on Rin\u2019s signature red sweater and a pair of jeans she found. Taking a look in Rin\u2019s full body mirror Saber notices that she still had that girlish blue ribbon holding her hair and while she disliked it she has no choice but to keep it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber does think about borrowing Rin\u2019s bed for the night but feels that may be disrespectful. Instead she goes down the stairs toward the living room. The king however almost trips when her stomach starts to grumble in hunger. Since she has hardly any mana and is not willing to hunt for the souls of innocent people food and sleep will have to do for now till she can find a way to break Caster\u2019s hold on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be as good as Shirou\u2019s but perhaps Rin has something?\u201d Saber says as she opens the door to the fridge. Inside she finds three sandwiches just like the ones Rin made for their outing along with a carbonated drink. Never being a picky eater Saber takes the food and drink to the dining room table and eats in absolute joy as she enjoys the modern cuisine. With her stomach now full and having a bit more mana then before Saber makes her way to couch not even remembering her head hitting the furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back the church Caster is laughing. Sure she might have lost Saber but it was not like she really <b>lost</b> her. The battle with Archer was short lived since the Servant easily joined her after she let the servant\u2019s former Master leave peacefully. However she did not share that Saber\u2019s location with him, not fully trusting the Archer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Saber your actions are just so <b>cute</b>!\" Caster squeals in delight. \"I could just watch you all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy to watch Saber\u2019s actions starting to the bus stop to the two story manor she is currently sleeping at. While she also enjoyed the Servant\u2019s embarrassment at her growing stomach as well she felt there could be something\u2026.<i>more</i> to it. Needless to say, even Caster felt that Saber\u2019s current inflation was not enough to get her off. With a simple spell transferred though their connection Caster giggles like a little girl waiting for candy. Due to Saber being sound asleep and using less mana there won\u2019t be much of change overnight so it would be best if she got back to her less fun projects for now. Shutting down the seeing orb for now, Caster gets back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Saber moves slightly in her sleep as feels something crawl up her spine. The spell that Caster casted on her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saber\u2019s eyes open as a stream of sunlight casts itself through one of curtains in Rin\u2019s house. With a small groan the Servant rubs her eyes trying to cast off her remaining drowsiness waiting for the smell of Shirou\u2019s cooking to flood her nostrils. The minute one of her hands touches her gorge like belly she instantly wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid anything change?!\u201d Saber asks aloud in a panic as she felt her gut. From what she saw though was the stomach she went to sleep with. It might look slightly bigger but just barely noticeable. She also felt a strange numbing sensation on her hips but throws it off since she might have slept awkwardly. <br>\r\nGetting up Saber notices her frazzled blonde hair as stray strands move in front of her face. She moves to the full length mirror in Rin\u2019s living room fully taking in her appearance as she fixes the slight mess called her hair. Her gut was noticeable thanks to the red sweaters form fitting shape and even if she had other options in clothes the king doubts there anything that would cover her without standing out which is the last thing she wants currently. She still feels weak from having low mana but as long as it\u2019s not a battle with a Servant she should be fine\u2026maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it just me or are this jeans a bit tight?\u201d Saber thought to herself as she put a finger between her waist and the jeans. Before she could put a couple fingers inside due to the difference of Rin\u2019s body and her own but now Saber could only put one finger inside and feel the silk panties she wears which now felt like they cling tighter to her as well. \u201cThis may not bode well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber is now concerned with the difference between the size of her butt before she slept and after she woke up. Perhaps she is being paranoid but when your stomach starts swelling due to a curse from a witch anyone would start noticing any difference on their body. Uncharacteristically for her normal self, Saber moves the jeans to around her ankles and starts to feel her buttock searching for any more abnormalities. If one saw her now their thoughts may have started to descend straight to the gutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does feel\u2026. a bit softer I suppose.\u201d Saber mumbles as her wondering hands descend to her thighs. The view to her front is somewhat impeded due to her swollen stomach so she has to either look back to see or rely on her sense of touch.  As the knight\u2019s fingers feel the skin directly underneath the panties she comes to a conclusion.\u201cHmm, it\u2019s hard to tell but I do believe my\u2026..behind is swelling just like my stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis changes things immensely. Her original plan was to wait for either Rin or her Master himself to come to the manor. Since this is a mage\u2019s house it would have enchanted security measures placed as well. Saber hoped that Rin would sense the change and therefore find her. Considering it\u2019s already morning however she doubts they are coming which means they are being cautious due to her kidnapping or something else has happened. Knowing her Master he is trying his hardest to find her thus making Rin prioritize him over her own holdings if Saber has a good grasp on the Master of Archer\u2019s personality.<br>\r\nSuddenly the same numbing sensation that feels similar to needles flares in Saber\u2019s hips and descends to her thighs making Saber off balance for a moment. Due to her jeans being around her ankles this makes her face plant directly to the carpeted floor with her butt in the air. Once it is done Saber makes to all fours before pleasure hits her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, no-<b>ahhhhh</b>\u201d Saber cannot help but release a pleasure filled moan similar to a cat\u2019s meow as she feels Rin\u2019s sweater move and stretch. Although she would deny it every time if asked, the pleasure she feels whenever her stomach swells gets stronger and stronger each time. Taking a moment to calm her dog like panting and the crimson blush that heats her face, Saber curses Caster in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Saber takes in the damage as she lifts the sweater over her stomach. Her stomach now had a prefect sphere like shape making her definitely look pregnant now. Her hips also seemed somewhat wider too. Now noticing how tight her panties are now as they dig slightly into her now curvaceous bubble like rear. Saber knows the curse has spread to her buttock. <br>\r\n\u201cI cannot wait any longer. Who knows when this madness will end?\u201d Saber grunts as she fights to pull up the jeans that fitted perfectly a minute ago. Once they win the battle of climbing over Saber\u2019s cheeks she easily zips and buttons them as her belly hangs slightly out the way. \u201cThere may be no limits to this curse.\u201d<br>\r\nIf there are no limits to this curse who knows what will happen to her. She could become unable to walk yet alone fight making her easier prey for other Servants are even Masters. Thus she has no choice but to either continue the search for Rin and Shirou on foot or try to stamp out the cause of her humiliations by herself. With a sigh, Saber pulls on one of Rin\u2019s thick red coats hoping to at least cover her stomach better and perhaps draw attention away to her rear which she knows will only continue to grow. With the cold morning weather outside not many would question a pregnant woman bundling up.<br>\r\nSaber then decides with determined eyes to go after-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the same time feels several piercing stares at her buttock. Annoying as it was, she has no choice but to deal with the stares while thinking of a plan. She has barely any energy in her only able to summon her sword nor is she able to armor up at all. She doubts her armor would be able to contain her new changes either way. Her stomach remains tight, barely jiggling with her steps but her arse.... is well cumbersome to say the least. It hasn't grown large perhaps a defined and tight against the jeans but that's it. The new weight on her hips make her realize her gait is slower as her thin legs have to lift more weight then usual. Deciding a small break is needed Arturia sits herself on one of  benches of a bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing this, Saber remembers one rule of the holy grail war. All battles must be conducted at night. It is still early morning however and by the time she makes it back to church it would be early afternoon. While she still has her honor and pride, the King of Knights is not sure how long she can wait for night. By the time night comes she may no longer be able to fight effectively. But waiting might be what she needs as it will allow her to recover her drained strength a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, intense momentary pleasure fills the blonde as her skin stretches just the slightest as her stomach and arse expand. It makes her squeak like a mouse, drawing some attention toward her body but the looks die away several embarrassing moments later. Thankfully magic cannot be shown directly to the world either and it seems Caster has taken this in account as she is not expanding noticeably. This drives Arturia to consider-</span></div></div>",

Her bra also seems to be gone for some reason. Also\u2026there was a mound on her\u2026.wait-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT IS THIS?!\u201d Saber yells as she finally fully wakes up. Her breasts, normally small and hardly worth mentioning were now larger. Saber has no idea on size but she has a good idea on fruits. The knight guesses they are the size of cantaloupes. The sweater is tight against them but provides not support whatsoever. The knight hefts them upward, noticing the relief her shoulders feel as she supports them in her hands. Saber\u2019s petite yet callused hands are barely able to cup around them as Saber feels a sensation of pleasure she normally would not feel go down her spine.  Saber pulls back her hands quickly causing the mounds of flesh to bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaster\u2026.\u201d Saber groans the witch has done something to her yet again. Saber sees the bra she was wearing earlier lying on the floor of her make shift bed. She can\u2019t wait for Rin or Shirou any more she must strike soon or else\u2026.she might not be able to swing her sword properly with her new assets getting in the way.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nFor now however she has to wait till night fall as battles between servants can only be fought then. However this bouncing flesh, this unfamiliar weight will only serve to trip her up on said battlefield. Rin\u2019s chest is small so it is unlikely for the girl to have anything to fit Saber\u2019s bigger breasts. <br>\r\nSuddenly a light bulb goes off in Saber\u2019s head as the knight goes to the bathroom and searches around. She manages to find a roll of wrapping bandages. Slowly with untrained hands, Saber wraps her chest up tightly as possible. Making it tight enough were her chest seems only half the size of cantaloupes. She tries to make it tighter but her lungs feel like they are pressing together. Once that is done, she considers putting wrapping around her stomach however it would be a waste of material and the knight thinks if she really needs more for her chest. If it gets bigger she  will need the bandages to wrap them also up. Saber goes to the door, knowing what she needs to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also if she can take out two servants as well, she might be able to redeem herself making this a win-win situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily raising her invisible sword over her right shoulder, Saber staggers her way to the nearest pillar ignoring the fact she nearly trips due to the high heels she is wearing.

She feels the familiar cloth of the dress she was forced to wear as well as a thin blanket. The soft comfort tells her she is in a bed. Finally noticing she has free movement of her hands, she moves them to her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the grogginess fades as her hands meet her stomach far too soon.  Swiping off the thin cloth covering her, the King finally sees her body. Her once tone and slim stomach is now distended and inflated. If someone saw her now they would think she was at least with child for at least several months. Her dress somehow contained the growth if just barely as it was stretched to it limit. Saber\u2019s flesh could now be seen through the now transparent white cloth and a few tears could be seen where her silky skin could escape. Her gut is hard but allows her fingertips to slightly sink in as she grasps it in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026.CURSE YOU CASTER!\u201d Saber roars as her shock fades into anger  and  literally jumps to out of the bed to find that witch only to find  thick metal bars stopping her not noticing the stone walls with no windows. She grasps them much like a wild beast as her stomach groans in betrayal at her movements. Even with her weakened state she should easily break these bars! Why-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAra, Saber you honestly think I would let you escape? How adorable.\u201d Saber hears Caster\u2019s footsteps as she comes out the dim lighting surrounding her cell. With a growl Saber tries to reach out and grab Caster before the pain forces her to calm herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sure you wish to be released Saber. I would too if I was in your predicament. \u201cCaster sneers as Saber glares as she grasps the bars in front of her. \u201cBut you tried to go against me\u2026.that requires a punishment~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that sing-song like voice Saber glared at the witch that dared to treat her this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I will make sure you pay for this humiliation tenfold Caster.\u201d Saber hissed as she glared at the hooded witch. If it was earlier she would look intimidating, currently however she looked like a pregnant teenager having a mood swing. Caster could not help but laugh as she snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a pause she holds her bloated stomach releases a loud groan and pressure begins to build once more. However it is different then the pressure then earlier. It felt\u2026strange, like something was changing inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaster\u2026just what did you<b>URRRP?!\u201d </b>Saber belches out. Surprised the Knight lets a hand fly to her mouth. Caster however did not answer, allowing the blonde to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the knight belches, tasting carbonated air before she can utter another word. Again the pressure bubbles inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrp\u2026.Casteurrp!\u201d Saber tries to do her best to choke down the air expelling form her mouth but regardless it continues to interrupt her.  With a blushing face the king tries to continue, \u201cJuurp\u2026.Just what did you<b>UUURP</b> do to me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever do you mean Saber?\u201d Caster said innocently. \u201cAre you not trying to scare me with those loud burps of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber\u2019s cheeks swell as a burp escapes into her mouth .A chain of burps joins swelling her cheeks to the point she can no longer contain it allowing a large belch to escape. Caster is slightly disappointed as the knight looked just like an adorable chipmunk. Perhaps down the road she could...make that permeant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber however is suffering a great embarrassment as she continues to burp. A knight with no control over their bodily functions is not a knight but an embarrassment. As she is the King of Knights this reflects on her the most. Silently, Saber vows to behead Caster the moment her guard is down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrp\u2026.Ugh, Caster youuu\u2026.urp\u2026\u201d Saber glared the Caster hoping that glares could kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand so I will explain it to you.\u201d Caster hums as she stands just in Saber\u2019s reach. \u201cI have established a connection between you and I. One quite similar to a contract between a Servant and their Master\u2026.but with a twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber continues to glare daggers despite burps escaping her. This allows Caster to continue,\u201d Basically inside your stomach is my magic and I\u2019ve changed it into something similar to a Reality Marble. Anytime I can change the property of the mana inside your stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou-u<b>-URRP </b>think  you can bind me with suuuurpcch tricks?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo this is just a reminder Saber.\u201d Caster smiles.\u201d You are my <i>puppet</i> and I am your <i>puppeteer</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Caster snaps her fingers and the pressure changes to something heavy. Slowly the knight\u2019s stomach becomes heavier as veins start to pop out showing against the King\u2019s white dress. By the time Saber is forced to stand bowl legged it feels like she has several tens of pounds inside her stomach. With tears in her eyes Saber stands making sure she does not get to her knees in front of Caster. However the weight continues to increase to the point the knight is forced to her knees, her gut barely touching her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I hold your strings now. Don\u2019t forget that Saber.\u201d With that said the witch disappears into a blue mist as the weight disappears. Standing up slowly due to not being used to her new gut Saber stares ahead. As servant she is bound to Caster and therefore should obey her. But as a knight, as a person she can\u2019t stand this humiliation. As such Saber decides to\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sometime Later....</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saber\u2019s belly groans just like it has done multiple times. It was not from hunger. Oh, how she wishes it was hunger, but it is not. It was because it was so <b>FULL</b>. Her stomach now is a perfect orb like shape and if one looked at her would think she is several months pregnant.Thankfully Caster has yet to make it grow any bigger but she always makes sure that Saber is uncomfortable or in a state of pleasure. She no longer knows how long she has been there either or if the Holy Grail War is still ongoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmghhh\u2026\u201dSaber lightly rubs her orb of a stomach. Her hand causes ripples across her belly similar to that of a wave thanks to Caster changing the mana inside her to a liquid. Saber is currently dressed in a white two piece bikini that has two ribbons on the bottom piece and shows off her figure well. Her thighs and hips are slightly wider due to inactivity thanks to the cage she is still trapped in making her butt more alluring as it hugs the fabric of her bikini. Her breasts are somewhat larger as well as they causing some of her flesh to peek out enticingly. Her arms were once thin but filled with tight muscles started to thin as the white skin that was now starting to sag slightly. Her hands were the only thing unchanged and covered in calluses. The Knight\u2019s skin was now getting closer to a pale white from not seeing any sunlight for a large amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, it should be impossible for Saber\u2019s body to change without magical assistance due to her status as a servant. But perhaps because she is still living as a servant her body can still change.  It could also be possible due to Caster being her Master she has managed to figure out a way to tamper with her body even more. A slight shiver goes up Saber\u2019s spine at that thought. If so, soon Caster may be able to control her body and her actions completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cJust\u2026. A bit longer, a b-bit more then I can escape.\u201d </i>Saber looks toward the wall with a dresser leaning against it, her voice filled with hope. Caster added it some days later after Saber\u2019s belching fit in order to add to Saber\u2019s humiliations as the dresser was filled clothes like a bunny suit, a thin dress you could almost see through it and this swimsuit. The swimming suit was the only thing she felt was decent and therefore wore the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she knew what was behind it. Saber had managed to find weak point in the wall order  to dig  through. The king had to be careful though as she did not know when Caster was watching so could only spend a few minutes at a time. But soon, she could make her escape. She could feel a small breeze so it had to mean she was close to the outside right? Saber moves slightly causing large ripples on her stomach and small ones on her thighs and butt. The movement starts to make her sick at what her body has become so she places her hands on her stomach causing pleasure to race across her nerves to her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle starts making Saber frown, the usual visitor is here either to humiliate her or perhaps inspect her. Yes inspect as in making sure she was not hiding anything on her person. It was another reason why Saber wore the swimming suit. It revealed everything and yet covers her private areas, making sure Caster\u2019s wondering hands never stay to long on the knight\u2019s person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, Saber perhaps you are finally starting to realize the greatness of your gift.\u201d Caster comes in dressed in modern clothes consisting of a shirt and a long dress with brown boots.  Something good may have happened to the witch lately if she is dressed up instead of the cloak she usually wears. Perhaps finally the witch is putting her guard down just a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want Caster?\u201d Saber says ignoring her taunt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026..you are still not willing to be my Servant?\u201d Caster smirks knowing from the knight\u2019s glare and the fire still in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d Saber says as Caster opens the cell\u2019s door and comes inside. Slowly Caster walks toward the sitting servant. Saber for her part does not resist what\u2019s to come as she knows now that the witch would just enjoy her futile resistance even more. The cell\u2019s door is still open as well. Saber knows that with her weaker body she could still overpower caster and escape if she wishes but with Caster having the command spells that also may not be a viable option. Perhaps though she could risk something happening to her body just to waste one of the command spells though. With only two out of three left thanks to her real Master\u2019s foolishness there is a chance of this not working as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you not going to resist at all today? How boring~\u201d Caster giggles as her warm hands touch Saber\u2019s slightly colder body. They start at Saber\u2019s arms wandering up and down. \u201cMy, are you losing weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaster pinches the loose skin on the king\u2019s arms enacting a grunt from her target. Saber knows full well that Caster is trying to get a reaction from her. Ignoring her verbal quips and roaming hands is hard but doing so will make it hard for the witch to say much. The witch then move lower feeling Saber\u2019s chest\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease just leave already Caster.\u201d Saber could not help but groan mentally as Caster explored Saber\u2019s pudgy body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Saber feels a chill go down her spine as Caster whispers her cold words, had the witch found out her plot? \u201cI know that you are digging your way to freedom. Did you really think I wasn't watching you all this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about.\"  The King states as she does her best to not leave behind a lie. Suddenly Caster grabs the blonde\u2019s buttock, making her jump as the witch's hand digs into the fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your finally got a bit more cushion to you. A good thing. You were so skinny before!\" Caster says as she easily pushes the knight down on the bed to her shock. How was this possible?! Caster must have seen her surprised as she continues,\" Of course you are so weak my dear, you\u2019re in my territory. You think I would give you the strength to resist me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch climbs onto Saber who groans as Caster sits herself on her wave like stomach. \" It must be uncomfortable to have somebody on top of your full stomach doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaber face turns green as the liquid mana to force to accompany her squished stomach, it felt like it was going to force itself out of her throat. However she won't let Caster have the satisfaction \" No, i-in fact....ugh it's comfort-ugggg-able.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really that's good.\" Caster suddenly pinches a certain part of Saber's breast through her binki top making her yelp before a small bottle filled with clear liquid is put in her mouth. \"Because it's going to get....more <i>wonderful</i> till you submit to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"MPH?!\"</b> Is all Saber can say as the content spill into her mouth. There was no taste to the liquid but Saber still refuses to swallow it. However Caster knows this would happen as her fingers are pinching her nose blocking off all the air to her lungs. The blonde briefly considers drowning but her instinct to live carries out quicker then she can suppress it as her throat bulges lightly as the liquid goes down her throat.<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, what a good girl you are Saber!\" Caster chuckles as she stands and snaps her fingers. The knight can fill the contents of her stomach changing to something more solid then liquid as the waves of her stomach seem to cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caster you....bit-ughh.\" Saber wants to call her out but a sudden pressure in her belly makes her stop. Her skin stretches as her stomach finally meets her lap directly her binki bottom stretches a bit to make room for the pregnant like abdomen. The swelling stops immediately as it does. Her head starts to feel dizzy as her limbs feel like lead. Before Saber knows it she has passed out with Caster chuckling in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saber it's time for your punishment.\" Caster giggles behind her hand, enjoying the fact that Saber is at her mercy. The drug should knock her out till the next stage starts....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Saber wakes up she finds herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blonde jerks her head upward only to see a strange sight. The rest of her body feels numb and unresponsive but her head and neck are able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTall marble pillars encircle both her and Caster. Beyond this pillars is various marble temples built seemingly in worship of this strange circle they were currently in. On the marble floor symbols that Saber believes to be Greek are all in complex circles inside a much larger one. Since Saber is the King of Knights under the study of the wizard Merlin she regonizes the circle. \"A summon circle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough still laced with grogginess Caster still is able to understand her stolen servant's words, \" correct you are Saber! I see you are not King Arthur for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know?\" Saber was sure she didn't give any indication of who she was. How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are the last Servants standing. Lancer, Archer, Berserker, Rider, Assassin.... they have all been defeated.\" Caster's words shake the blonde. \"I had a bit of time on my hands in between with playing with you my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Have you killed my Master?\" Saber speaks in dread realizing the truth of the witch's words.If she defeated the Servants it's possible she also has killed the Masters as well. Her's include.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Master is me, Arturia. The current owner of the Holy Grail.\" Caster grins as Saber's glare bores into her skull. \" Don't worry the brat is safe alongside that other girl. She was not a half bad opponent dispite everything. But their safety hinges on you of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You witch! This has nothing to do with them!\" Saber tries to move forward but realizes both her arms and legs won't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally self aware of her own situation and able to feel her limbs, the King of Knights realizes she is chained up like the last time by Caster's binding magic, her derriere faces outward seductively , her hips and her binki bottom (thankfully still on her she notes) showing her derriere off wonderfully. Her slightly bigger breasts hang downward poking through her top at certain points. Her stomach, fit to be called a prefect sphere at this point, wobbles as she struggles. Beneath her flesh Saber can tell it's semi soild at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't worry my dear I won't make you call me Master.\" Caster cups Saber's chin and forcing the blonde to look at her. \"But you must keep this thing entertained for a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Saber could even ask a bright light comes blinds her before a large shadow overcomes both her and the witch. Looking upwards Saber sees a monster. A veil mass of slime  with out eyes, shape, or even a mouth stands before her. The creature makes no sounds save for the bits of self that drips off the raised mishapen slime tentacles. It easily towers over the pillars and takes up half the summon circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is THAT?!\" Saber nearly screams like a demsel at the monstrous thing before her. Some kind of Devilfish or familiar made by Caster?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I am unsure what it is.,\" Caster admits. \"All I know is that it came from the Holy Grail itself and is completely obedient to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercoming her shock the blonde stares at the witch. If she wants to save Shirou and Rin she better do what Caster wants.\" what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite easy Saber I wish for you to-\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shock makes her arch backwards, unused to this feeling.  Caster teased her over the days but still\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Caster played with her at times the shock and the arched back that shows off the captured knight\u2019s pregnant like stomach was wonderful to see for the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cSoon Saber\u2026you will willingly offer yourself up to me.

Perhaps even worse.\"</i> Saber thinks somberly as her body starts to betray her as her hips trembles the slightest at the teasing. She can't fight back and the chance of another Servant rushing in here is nil, if Caster words are true. <i>\"For now I'll have to withstand this assault then deal with it....\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nA loud gurgle from Saber's stomach gets its owners interest as the slime ceases to tease her body and her breasts. Caster's snickers set it as more loud gurgles come from her stomach as more of the melted slime makes it's way to her stomach. Her stomach is full to the brim from the invading slime and the mana Caster has forcibly transferred to the knight. Saber\u2019s hips twist and her chest bounces as she tries to shake free. However, the slime keeps a firm and tight hold on her limbs. This causes her stomach to make even louder gurgles as it protests from the movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Saber....who much you think your stomach can hold? I'm curious....aren't you?\" Caster smirks darkly. \"I highly doubt a Servant can die from overeating but if it is possible...you'll find out won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HMMMGGGH!\"</b> Saber grumbles aloud as her stomach inches forward the slightest as it rubs against her slightly wet bikini bottom as the slime like creature makes another quick lick.

We don't want to be here all day right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"UM?\"</b> Saber groans as more of the creature\u2019s mass slides down her mouth.

Deciding to make the project into a pendant that will enable her to observe the \"waves\" of other possible universes. Naturally with Rin being...Rin (and messing with forces that are beyond mortal comprehension) the ritual fails spectacularly (and explosively). However, asides from her recent failure Rin's troubles doesn't end there, turns out the experiment has amassed a large amount of mana from (possibly countless) parallel worlds and instead of dissipating into the air they get absorbed by the nearest available vessel: Rin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her magic circuits can only hold so much mana, the rest of it has to go somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Scenario Two</u>:<br>\r\nIn the Clock Tower, the headquarters and main branch of the Mage's Association, there is one silent rule within the Department of Mineralogy: \"That Tohsaka and Edelfelt must not attend class together.\" However said silent rule should be \"Tohsaka and Edelfelt should not be within the same facility <u>period</u>.\" It's common knowledge that Rin Tohsaka and Luviagelita Edelfelt meet, chaos and collateral damage soon follows. Now normally, that is standard behavior between opposing Magus families, but those two take it to a whole another level that can be downright terrifying (or comical to some) to even the most experienced mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's where the proverbial \"s\" hits the fan. Rin and Luvia are within the same room, normally any sane Magus worth their family crest would automatically high tail it and run before the spells go flying, this room is different: it's a room specifically meant for duels between Magi. The reason, it seems both of them required a certain text for their research but only one is available, and since sharing is usually not practiced amongst Magi they decide the settle this another way: by blasting one another. Yet during their duel Luvia opts to not only just fight Rin, but humiliate her with a little spell that the former developed just for the latter. Will Rin end up with the thighs and butt the size of exercise balls, or will Luvia also find herself on the expanded side instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Magi will not care, as long as they just blast themselves instead of everything (and everyone else) in a mile radius.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep within the Tohsaka Manor, a young woman sits alone inside the Study, her eyes focus on the small crystal fragments lying on the desk in front of her. To the average human the crystal pieces could be classified as \"worthless junk\" but for a Magus worth her weight in salt those little bits and pieces could hold the key to accessing a power that no level of science can explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were pieces of the Jewel Sword Zelretch, a Mystic Code that could draw a practically endless amount of mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin couldn't believe her luck when she found fragments on her clothes a few days after the insanity that was the Fifth Holy Grail War. When she detonated the sword as a last ditch move during her final battle she was sure that the code was utterly vaporized in the blast. Perhaps her luck have finally turn out to the better after all the insanity that has happen to her before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her, the part that is Tohsaka Rin the Magus, is already processing the possibilities this finding can bring. The Jewel Sword itself is capable of drawing in infinite mana, despite it being only a cheap copy, the fragments themselves could theoretically be able to do the same albeit diminished to a degree. To unlock the mysteries of these crystal fragments would mean unlocking the mystery that is the Second True Magic. To unlock the Kaleidoscope could also mean one step closer to her goal, the goal of all Magi, to reach the Akasha Records, the Root of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another part of her, the part that isn't Tohsaka Rin the mage or Tohsaka Rin the honor student, but Tohsaka Rin the girl can't even bring up the drive beyond just twiddle the crystal shards between her fingers and checking the cut of the gems. She can only pay half a mind to the little gems and focus more on her personal issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first rule of being a Magus is to walk with death. Their experiments could prove fatal, their research can twists minds into a macabre of insanity and madness, there is always that one possibility that one moment could mean the difference between life or death. She understood that fact, acknowledge it, accepted it as just another fact of being a Mage and still carried herself with grace, dignity, and pride. Yet for all her pride and understanding of what it means being a mage of Tohsaka, it was during the hell that was the Fifth Grail War that she can see the she was still nothing more than a child in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown crosses her features. The Grail Wars, within those few weeks she has experienced horrors and madness that will haunt her till the end of her days. She saw the bloodshed it can cause, the chaos it can brew, the damage it can create, all for the sake of one wish...only to find out it was nothing more than a red herring. Still it was not just the Grail war that disturbed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...\" Rin murmurs to herself as she rests herself against the chair she was sitting on. Within those few weeks she found the truth of the HELL that was her sister's treatment at the hands of that despicable clan, Matou. She saw the signs, she saw how Sakura changed from the time she last saw as a child of Tohsaka before being sent away by her own father, but despite her wish to bring back her blood sister one fact cruelly plays in her mind every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch is the life of Magi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frown deepens. In a sense, the Grail Wars and Sakura's condition had one thing in common: Magi. It was Magi that established the Grail Wars and the madness that ensue (not to mention how it is tied in with Emiya Shirou's \"condition\"), and it was the pride and rules of Magi that made her father gave away Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe too is a Magus, but a thought plagues her. Will she maybe do the same? To sacrifice what it means to be a decent human just for sake or pride or whatever that is that drives a Magus forward. Just like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell!\" She shouts as she slams her hand on the desk as in defiance to something, \"I am the heir of Tohsaka but I will not go to such extremes like...that.\" She says the last part as if it was a curse. She turns back to the matter at hand before such hesitations grips her heart once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where was I? Oh yeah, putting these pieces back together or something.\" She tries to regain her posture and grace befitting the not just the Head of the Tohsaka House, but as Tohsaka Rin the magus. She quickly piles the jewel fragments together and goes back to the task at hand i.e. \"What the hell am I going to do with these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite these shards originally came from something that was only brought into this world by Gradation Air they still exist without being erased by the World.\" She observes before honing in her senses, \"I can still feel power within them, not at the level as the Jewel Sword but still quite a bit. I wonder...\" She places a hand above the shards, her magic circuits start circulating with prana, \"...since these things are just pieces of a while, I believe that single spell might put them together into a single item.\" She takes a deep breath, \"Was verbirgt sich getrennt (What lies seperated),\" the pieces begin to glow, \"so einig sein wie eins (shall be united as one).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conservation of mass states that the mass of a matter in a isolated system will remain constant over time. So theoretically, just combining some jewel shards together into one gem, the product will have the same mass as the components that were used in its creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently modern science didn't take into account the little black box that is the Kaleidoscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces converge and emit a bright, Rin only had a fraction of a second to see a reaction coming from the gems before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright blast of prismatic light shines forth as the jewel shards somehow detonated themselves...with equally expected results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast wave sends the red-clad mage back away from her desk into a nearby wall. Normally such an event could possibly cripple anyone, but a Magus skilled in Reinforcement will be only dizzy, slightly blinded by the light, ears ringing from the explosion, and a bit sore from the hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she blows a tuff of hair out of her eyes, \"That was a...set back.\" Not missing a beat she picks herself off the ground and makes her way to the desk, grimacing as she finds her work bench has been reduced to wooden planks and scraps. \"Damn it, these things get expensive.\" She moans the lost of her work station before checking out her own body. \"No cuts or bruises building up. My circuits all are in perfect shape. Strange, no way can I emerge from this accident practically unscathed.\" She furrows her brow and waits a few moments, inspecting herself for any delayed after effects.</span></div></div>",

Each second felt like it was going forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tick*Tock*Tick*Tock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time marches on she stands still as a statue, awaiting any possible belated effects her accident may have caused.

Skin, muscle, organs, blood vessels, bone structure, limbs, face, everything from top of her head to the bottom of her feet she inspects with a critical eye. She even checks her magic circuits both within her soul and within the Tohsaka family crest, all clear and none of them worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tick*Tock*Tick*Tock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fine. Aside from the initial discomfort of the blast, there's is absolutely nothing wrong with her in any way shape or form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tick*Tock*Tick*Tock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was dealing with the Second True Magic, Kaleidoscope, of all things. No way that an accident on that magnitude that she will emerged unharmed. No way, something must be up. She couldn't be that lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tick*Tock*Tick*Tock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places a hand on her hip and thinks of the worst possible cases that play in her head. One vision she can see herself glowing before bursting into a bright explosion mimicking what happen to the shards of the jewel sword. A second vision, she sees her body so fix up before being transmogrified into a crystal likeness of herself...before cracking once and shattering completely like glass. A third possible, she envisions herself shrinking and growing fur everywhere before she's fully transforms into a cat. A final, the worse she believes, she can see herself sink into the floor, her entire body melting away into a red good; her hand reaching out for a helping hand before she's entirely reduced to a puddle on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hate having morbid thoughts. \"Well,\" she puts up a grim smile, \"Compared to the Fifth Grail War, being a puddle of goo doesn't sound that bad.\" She takes a deep breath before awaiting whatever befalls her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Dong*Dong*Dong*Dong*Dong*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only at the sounding of the clock bell that the young magus can see that it's been some time since the blast, and not to mention it was getting pretty late. She stifles a yawn that she didn't knew was building up. \"Hm, I must have been more tired than I thought.\" She soon stretches, \"I guess I should be glad that its the school break right now and I don't have to worry about waking up early.\" Exhausted after her little ordeal, a warm shower and some sleep really does sound appealing. With one final check up of her person, the Tohsaka magus soon departs her study and prepares for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nightly routine of a quick shower and some leftovers for dinner the young woman is soon dressed in her kitty pajamas and lays herself on her bed, her mind already casting off into slumber. \"I really should be more concern about what happen, but...\" She takes a deep breath before cuddling against her pillow, \"...perhaps for a latter time.\" She soon drifts off and enters a blissful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing predictable about Magecraft, especially Magic, is its unpredictability. If Rin was more aware of that fact and open the mind to the possibility of the impossible then maybe she would be more mentally prepared for what was going to happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, it wouldn't be fun now, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the problem maybe is not just the explosion, but also the RESULT of said explosion. To put it simply, the shards of the Jewel Sword Zelretch are capable of pulling a large quantity of mana from an infinite number of parallel worlds, however due to their small size each fragment can only pull in only a limited amount. Still, even a single shard is able to pull in a large amount alone, having more of them simply pool the total mana together. Yet, the shards simply pulled in too much, too fast and could not handle the stress and thus exploded. The end result, a large concentration of mana, collected from countless worlds, all clumped together into a single spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this is where Rin's troubles will soon begin. Normally such a great quantity of magical energy would soon dissipate into the air without a vessel or will to guide it. However there is just such a container standing nearby; Rin. Mana, has no will, but can be absorbed as such, Rin became the container for the mana she called forth without knowing. Now here comes the problem, Rin's circuits can only hold so much mana until there's no more room, where does the rest of it go? Easy, with the circuits filled to capacity, the mana just goes to the next available space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night moves on, and the young magus sleeps unaware to her condition the results will soon speak to itself...at the morning when she wakes most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMornings for Rin were usually just a bother for the girl. As much as she understands the necessity in waking up early to get the day started it doesn't mean she has to enjoy leaving slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this morning is different, much, much different. She was able to tell the moment her mind started waking up way before her body could even respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something happen to me, and I will not like it...at all.\" She mumbles to herself as her eyes start to open up. \"Mirror, now.\" With a grunt she forces herself up and can already tell that something is wrong with her. \"Mind still muddy, need to get to the bathroom.\" She gets off her bed and nearly falls over, her center of gravity is thrown way off balance. \"Not a good sign.\" She makes her way to her bathroom, becoming aware that she can feel something...heavy pulling her down and around. Ignoring the growing sense of dread she opens the bathroom door, turns on the lights, and inspects herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to see what happen to her and she's feeling off. It was really foolish of her to actually think that nothing will happen, she was dealing magic after all. Right? Right. All she need to handle this in a calm and elegant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, calm and eleg-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW THE FRICK DID I GET PREGNANT?!\" Rin shouts to all the high heavens to see the reflection of herself with the belly of a volley ball in the mirror. She looks down and can feel her stomach drop to see that her own condition reflects the image in the mirror. With a shaky hand she pokes her gravid belly, the sensation of a dainty finger touching flesh reaches her brain and she bites down the urge to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a nervous chuckle, \"Somehow I think being a slime puddle sounds much better right now.\" Hands still shaky she soon rubs her recently expanded stomach. She can feel a light warmth coming from her belly, sparking her curiosity. \"Wait a second.\" Closing her eyes, she activates her circuits in preparation of a spell, \"Analysis Start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon finds out that she wasn't pregnant, but a part of her really wishes that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMana, light and active, was swirling around in her stomach, no doubt this condition is related to last night. Now there was something else also happening, that source of mana in her belly, it is growing, slowly but surely. She can already feel her skin of her abdomen being stretch farther little by little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Rin's eyebrows twitch, \"Seems like I'm either a mana generator or storage now...great.\" She palms her face. \"Now what am I suppose to do?\"</span></div></div>",

The sudden surge of stress soon strikes the following two buttons and they too gave out and flew off the sleepwear, exposing Rin's stomach for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl only half pouts half grimaces, \"Right, first morning routine then research.\" With a slight moan over the damage of her favorite night shirt (she was able to get it at a good price), the Tohsaka mage starts stripping off her nightwear in preparation for a morning shower (water bills be damned she needs the warm water to calm her already frazzled nerves).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter long shower and a light breakfast, Rin went to her study, instead of her usual attire of her favorite red sweater and black skirt she put on a simple outfit of a red tank top and black sweat shorts. If the fate of her pajama shirt was any indication of her body's status towards her clothing, she would prefer wearing something that would at least take the strain. Clothing is expensive and she wasn't made of money no matter how much she wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here she is. Tohsaka Rin, current head of the Tohsaka line of Magi, dressed with exercise clothing, with a belly that (to her chagrin) is now the size of a small beach ball and still growing slowly. Sitting on a wooden arm chair that was able to survive last night's explosion, Rin drummed her fingers of one hand while resting her head on the other, her eyes glaring at her bloated stomach. Her mind now running into overdrive as she perform observation and mental compilation on her predicament and then trying to see if she can formulate a plan to cure herself of her expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replays the scenario from last night and result of it. She found the fragments of the Jewel Sword Zelretch on her person and decided (God knows what possessed her for even going through with it) to fuse the shards together into a single crystal. Said experiment caused the shards to activate and draw in an unknown and no doubt, VAST amount of mana, however the shards drew in too much power too fast and promptly exploded that thankfully didn't killed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow problem, the jewel shards drew in a high amount of mana and apparently instead of dissipating into the air entered into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond problem, her circuits can only hold so much magic power and whatever mana that wasn't processed by her circuits now uses her body as a means of storing itself, hence her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird problem, she has no idea how much mana she pulled in. She knows for sure she drew in a lot of it, prior experience with wielding the Jewel Sword can attest that it can bring a lot of power. So she is sure that even fragments can potentially bring in a large number of it. That lies the problem, if she's now being used as some sort of battery or vessel for whatever energies she brought, what could potentially happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest case scenario, she can look like some sort of demented bloated or perhaps balloon version of herself. Her body is now a container so logically speaking any part of her body can be effected. Her belly is already affected what could be next? Her breasts, her butt, or perhaps all around. She groans at the vision of her head of herself expanded to make her look like some sort of parade balloon. Such a fate is not a pleasant one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost likely scenario, she blows up. Rin wasn't so foolishly think that her body would take the intake and still be in one piece. She'll keep on getting bigger true, but  she's aware that her body has limits. She'll keep on getting bigger and bigger until...bang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold chill runs up her spine before she shakes her head to clear out the morbid thoughts. \"Calm yourself Tohsaka, you've been in worser scraps than this you mustn't let this get to you. Focusing back to her belly she takes both her hands and starts rubbing the swollen flesh, her mind ignoring the...good feelings her rubbing is causing herself. She instead gets curious that her stomach is not firm, instead it feels as if she's holding a swollen ballon, her fingers slightly sinking into the skin. Curiosity peaked she pushes her belly inward to see how it will react, her eyes widen to find the enlargement soon sinking into her body at an alarming rate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only to give a squeak of alarm as she feel suddenly build up from underneath her seat and push her upward slightly. The feeling of sitting on something really soft makes the girl's eyes widen as she feels something happen to her butt and hips, \"I pray that's my mind playing tricks on me.\" She takes her hands and glide them over her lower figure and shudders as what she expects. With a wince the young woman glances downward. \"Of course.\" she moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was back to normal, what was once a stomach belonging to a woman late into her pregnancy, a smooth flat surface greeted her. Still the mana that she forced out of her belly had to seek shelter somewhere and it appears her butt and also thighs was available. Her once trim and normal backside exploded into a rear end big enough to wedge itself between the chair's arm rests. Whatever mana gathered into her abdomen was divided evenly, her sweats shorts stuck out so much that it look like she stuffed two basketballs into them, her thighs were also in proportion to her enlarged hindquarters having swollen to three to four times their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein pops up in the Tohsaka mage's head, \"As much as I'm glad my stomach no longer makes me look I'm about to go into labor.\" She grabs the chair's armrests with both hands with a vice-like grip, \"I refuse to have the ass OF A BLOOD COW!\" She pulls herself up a bit before slamming herself onto to her butt with the force of a sledgehammer. The result is instant, the mana is compressed into a single point (shrinking her lower half to correct proportions) before moving itself upward. Yet the surge passes through her stomach and concentrates into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin figures what's going to happen next. \"Oh shi-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BA-BROWMP!*<br>\r\nRin felt her breasts explode into the size of watermelons. The sudden shift of mass makes gravity do its thing, and the poor mage soon finds herself keeling over before feeling two large mounds cushioning her fall. She winces as her suddenly sensitive breasts get pressed upon by the rest of her body weight. She could barely register that her tank top was forced up by her massive mammaries, baring them in au natural glory to any other soul. Exhausted by the recent ordeal, Rin could collapse furthermore into her boobs and used them as a form of pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I can live like this. I'm human not some sort of expandable ball of mana.\" Her eyes widen to the size of dinner plates before smacking herself on the forehead, \"Mana, ugh idiot.\" The answer is so obvious, thaumaturgy requires magical energy and she so happens to be battery of the stuff. All she needs to do is casts some wasteful spells and hopefully her figure slims down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea bulb lights up in head but she flinches at the suggestion. She can call her sister and her servant over to help her with all the excess. Sakura herself, due to those Matou bastards, is capable to absorbing energies from other parties. Rider herself can also do the same, being a spirit she can take another's energy in order to become more powerful or to maintain her existence. This option is the more efficient, but part of Rin feels guilty for having her sister pull out of a mess that she herself gotten into. Sakura has experienced so much at the hands of the Matous. Rin didn't want her sister to have to go through the same mess the Tohsaka is in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo available options, one slow and steady, the other quick but could spread to two others. Rin takes a deep breath to think about her choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for the results of her experiment to make itself known to the twin-tail Magus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling hits the girl's mind, a feeling that washes over her body as the signals nearly overwhelm her senses. She was hot, she was cold. She was big, she was small. She was heavy, she was light. Up, down. Left, right. Positive, negative. Contradicting signals run through as she struggles to even maintain her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that all she's experiencing is nausea and a sense of vertigo is probably a good sign a part of her noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...not, good.\" The girl mutters to herself as she holds up her head in one hand and grabs a nearby table for balance with the other. Her legs quiver under the imaginary stress from Root knows where. Normally such experiences would drive the average man into a sense of madness, but she was not average (Average One, yes, but not average). She is Tohsaka Rin, head to the Tohsaka line of Magi, an exceptional Magus in her right, and she will not let some sort of messed up experiment simply do her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo her in, no way. Make her feel like what it means to have a hangover, that's a big, fat, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the urge to just fall over to the ground and gain a stable bearing, Rin focuses all her attention to stay up and thinking of whatever her is going on with her. She already knows that her experiment has done something to her, what it is she does not know. Whatever it is, she doesn't like it, not at all. It's an unknown variable, and she loathes them with a fiery passion. An unknown variable can either all she ends up getting is a sinking feeling in her stomach for a period of time, or she might end up dead. As much as she understand that \"To be a magus is to walk with death\", she has no intention to go down due to single mistake, she won't be able to live it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Rin, you're better than this.\" She grips the edge of the table like her life depended on it, \"You've been through worser scraps than this. Don't let this bring you down.\" She grits her teeth, already she can feel the dizziness receding bit by bit. She could almost bring herself to smile to her perseverance. Almost being the key word. As she soon starts regaining her balance a new feeling starts building up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr a feeling that could only be best described as bloated. Like something that is building up insider her body. Not air, not fat, just...something. Confused she places a hand on her stomach as if to calm it somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes soon widen when she feels something building underneath her fingers. Building up and out. Her skin turns slightly pale as she looks down at what her hand is on, and turns even whiter to see why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the red fabric of her favorite sweater, a bulge, present and unfortunately growing, is there where her once trim stomach was. No the bulge didn't replace her stomach, the bulge IS her stomach. If the logical part of her mind can draw up a conclusion, she can guesstimate that her stomach is about the size of a volleyball. Well it would, if she wasn't summarizing and handling the situation with the elegance of a Magus of her caliber can bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH ME?!\" Rin shrieks to all the high heavens. Her earlier sense of nausea completely pushed aside from shock over her new \"look\", it soon turns into dread to see that the condition is spreading. She can already feel the same bloating feeling reach both her chest and rear end, and also start to show signs of growing. She can see her breasts slowly start to gain cup size after cup size, straining the bra she already has on and can feel her center of gravity shift over. As for her lower figure, she did not look, but can already feel her posterior and hips balloon out, her apathetic side noted that her ass has already grown about three times it size, growing at a faster rate than her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the chaos going on in her body, Rin could only mutter one thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murphy's Law, thou art a heartless thing.\"</span></div></div>",

Was she gonna die? Was she gonna vommit? Turn into a dog? Burst into pieces? Reduced to goo or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, she's fallen flat onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-X-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin-tailed girl stirred as she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the...\" She groaned, reaching a hand to rub her eyes. Then it hit that the ritual went backwards and her and she passed out, jolting right up and darting for the restroom across the hall. She slammed the door open and ripped off her shirt and began to inspect herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome soot on the lower arms and territory between her thigh highs and skirt? Check. Cleaned off with a nice clean wet wash clothe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome bits of desk stuck in her obsidian hair? Check. A good plucking with her delicate digits cleaned that right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes scanned across her slim physique, trying to find anything that was amiss. Nothing. She gave out a sigh of relief as she leaned against the sink and sank down, sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god for that,\" she said out loud. She remembered that her circuits seemed fine before the explosion, although the nausea and passing out were still on her mind. Could it have been her brain or a concussion? No, if it was anything resulting in her brain she wouldn't have woken up, more or less remain in a coma. So perhaps magecraft could have caused it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPracticing her spells should work, as she put on her red sleeved shirt and went to the basement of the manor to practice. Reaching for a red stone, she aimed it at a target dummy, poured prana into it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the spell fired off without a hitch, but the kick sent Tohsaka flying, but with a simple Reinforcement she was relatively unhurt as she slammed into some crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww....\" She groaned, looking up and taking in the damage. The dummy was incinerated, obviously, but the blast was larger than she'd thought, creating a much more blackened smear on the stone walls and floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just poured a little prana into that fire stone...it should not have caused-\" Then it clicked. The ritual! Maybe the side effect was something of a catalyst of sorts, increasing the power of her magecraft and decreasing the amount of prana needed to cast it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" She chirped, skipping up the stairs humming, chest full of pride and glee as she walked out the doors of the european castle mansion, humming and her mood was like that of the blue sky in Fuyuki Spring. \"So Awesome!\" She then finally finished traveling up the road and saw her mailbox, and saw a mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood mood gone. Bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit...\" She trudged back to the manor. She could have tried to use hypnosis on the bill collectors, but something called the \"internet\" kept an internal log of her finances, and they wanted payment for her utilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents must have been so lucky...not living in this time where the internet had an archive where even she cannot break into with the greatest of magecraft. She shook her fist at the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you internet and tax collectors!\" She puffed out her cheeks and dragged her feet back to the mansion, her left hand itching her bottom in the process. She felt her skirt be a tiny bit snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been the stupid laundry. Sakura says it shrinks clothes...\" And she closed the doors with a slam.</span></div></div>",

Well all that is needed is a scenario...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rin's Secret</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin Tohsaka. What else can be said about her? Top student in terms of academics, gifted athlete, a pleasent personality, and quite beautiful to top it off. The honor student worthy of all the admiration and envy of her fellow peers. So what if she has her moments of emotional outbursts, people tend to ignore those (and in some cases forget it even happen). Still that's also not taking what people don't know about Rin's lineage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing from a line of accomlished magi, Rin spends her time after school pursuing her family's craft and studying the art known as thaumaturgy. For years, she has dived into the abyss known as the supernatural, learning about it, disecting its mysteries and its processes, spending many long hours just to make that little bit of headway towards the goal of all Magi: the Akasha Records, the Root of all existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonor student by day, proud magus by night. Quite a combination one would say. It's hard to imagine anyone balancing such activites and still maintain her \"honor student\" persona without buckling under the stress load, unless your name is Rin Tohsaka. Though the truth of the matter is so different the very fabric of reality will shatter if everyone else finds out (okay not really, but for dramatic effect just pretend so).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth of the matter is that Rin Tohsaka, honor student magus, is human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a human, she can get just as stressed about her life as the next person. It's only natural. The problem now being...how does she handle the stress? By relaxing of course. Only her version of relaxation can be called different from the norm, course magi in general are different from the average person but that's understandable. It's just that her means of releasing stress involves a peculiar something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn inflation fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years, people don't even have an inkling of an idea that Rin Tohsaka has an inflation fetish. Well, she does, and has been doing for quite a while, such is the benefit of having a house that people stay away from due to rumors of being haunted and being protected by several bounded fields to ensure privacy. Privacy where Rin can just blow herself up like a balloon and just let the stress of her life just float away, along with herself from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust so happens, right now it's one of those times...</span></div></div>",

She heard the slight frying of the pan from the kitchen and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You back Illya?\" Said Shiro from the kitchen. As Ilya walked inside he was in his PJs. This was his last day before school kicked back, this being his last holiday-day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I'm gonna take a shower to clean up first! Can't wait to eat breakfast!\" Beamed the girl. The redhead nodded and turned back to his stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Taiga is still asleep so be quiet when you're using the shower okay?\" Ilya replied with a \"mm-hm!\" and walked along towards where the showers inside the Emiya mansion was located. As she walked, she just past by Shiro's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing the silver haired girl noticed was that the boy was a bit on the dense side, whether it came to sexual situations(she heard from Rin about Shiro and Saber's little \"event\" to restore their prana. Ilya was NOT amused.) or when it came to jokes. Maybe if she peeked around inside his room she could find something he liked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'd be violating his privacy!\" Murmured the homunculus to herself. She turned her head, seeing the bathroom down the hall. Turned her head again towards Shiro's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShower. Room. Shower. Room...</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t take it!\u201d Said Ilya as she walked into Shiro\u2019s room, closing the door behind her and looking around for any clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026where would Shiro place something that he would like?\u201d Pondered the white haired girl. She walked quietly towards the closet and opened, peeking her head inside, seeing the rows of the hanged clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Ilya gave a puff as she closed the closet door and saw his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Big brother has a journal or a diary?\u201d She walked forward and opened up some drawers, seeing old schoolwork, pens, pencils, some old manga comics. Ilya took some of the manga comics and scrolled them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, just the usual Shounen-type manga, nothing that would really stand out on what type of woman Shiro prefers. Boy and band of friends fight bad guys blah blah blah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked another manga. This time it was more a comedy Slice of Life manga, with wacky hijinks and homages and parodies to popular series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya gave another sigh and placed the comics back into the drawer and noticed some of the pictures on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one of Shiro and Kiritsugu out in the courtyard, bringing a smile to the Einzbern. She could still remember the old days when she used to play with her father around the Einzbern castle grounds during winter, the smile he had, and chuckling her mother had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018At least they are in a better place now\u2026\u2019 Ilya then inspected another photo, one of Shiro reeling from one of Taiga\u2019s strikes from her Kendo stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother is stronger than her now for sure!\u201d Chuckled the girl. The man was able to become a decent sword fighter, and if Shiro would one day become like that Archer person, he has nothing worry about as long as he practices his magecraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards another photo, this time of Sakura and Shiro eating with Taiga. The white haired girl paid little heed to the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the final photo was one of Shiro and Saber, and the smile on his face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The only way big brother would ever smile like that again is if she can return\u2026but with the Grail destroyed she could never return from the Throne of Heroes\u2026\u2019 Ilya thought sadly. She wanted to make Shiro happy! She wanted to see him smile again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what does Shiro like? There\u2019s nothing in here except what typical boys have\u2026\u201d Pouted Ilya as she sat down on the bed and leaned back, placing her hands behind her for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she felt something, like a piece of paper. This caused the white haired girl\u2019s eyes to rise up and she turned around. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough, there was a corner of a magazine article sticking out from under the pillow. And Ilya puffed her cheeks out in anger.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMou\u2026That Shiro\u2026\u201d To think he had indecent magazines underneath his sheets! Ilya pulled out the magazine and flipped to a page, not bothering to see the cover page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaaah!\u201d She threw down on the bed in surprise and shock, and the page came to view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother\u2026he\u2026he\u2026.\u201d And on the page, was a rather plump schoolgirl eating ice cream, some of the dairy treat dribbling down her exposed cleavage. Her belly was threatening to burst her blue skirt open and she had a pleasant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the magazine again and scrolled through more pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlump teenage girl in swimsuit uniform. More Hourglass than the previous girl and had dark skin with blonde hair, showing that she was into Ganguro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fat female, this time in a cat-girl plus maid outfit. She had dyed white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a more mature woman, more plump and possessing a powerful of thunder thighs, was writing on a chalk board with her huge rump facing the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it clicked into Ilyasviel von Einzbern\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beloved big brother Shiro Emiya\u2026liked fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiro\u2019s a chubby chaser!\u201d She yelled out loud. She immediately covered her mouth and walked slowly towards the door, unable to comprehend anything at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she approached the door\u2026</span></div></div>",

Big brother likes fat girls. Big brother likes fat girls. Big brother likes fat girls,\u2019 she repeated that dreaded mantra inside her head. She still couldn\u2019t comprehend how Shiro likes the fairer sex\u2026heavier. Wasn\u2019t that what all males detested? Females being fat and the health issues it brought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked inside her room, generously given to her by Taiga and Shiro themselves and got a new pair of clothes, this time a simple purple sundress and a pair of socks and underwear and stammered into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she rounded a corner, she saw a\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZOMBIE!\u201d She yelled, breaking out of her doldrums and scramming to the bathroom in terror and locking the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she thought was a zombie was a very sleepy and disgruntled Taiga, with bags under her eyes, sandmans in her eyelids, her hair a mess, and wearing moss eaten and torn up PJs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoooffeeeee\u2026\u201d He moaned as she literally walked LIKE a zombie towards the direction of the kitchen. \u201cCoooffeeeee\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Ilya kept her hands over her ears as she saw the shadow of Taiga passed by the door, biting her lip and shivering as the groans of \u201cCooffeeee\u2026\u201d disappeared. Ilya stood up and breathed in and out, calming herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need a shower,\u201d she murmured as she stripped and walked inside the shower and started the water, letting it run down her lithe form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a Homunculus, a being created by alchemy and magecraft. All homunculi, along with great longevity as long as the planet as mana, have great affinity to magecraft. However, there was a price. Some Homunculi have short lifespans. Others are short in stature, or can\u2019t reproduce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya originally had a short lifespan along with a short stature, as she was doomed to die one year after the Holy Gray War, but with the Angra Mainyu destroyed the world\u2019s mana would flow into her as if breathing in oxygen. While she was cursed with her small lithe physique, she would live a long life and essentially have something like eternal youth, which is not unheard of in the magical world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if a Homunculus got fat? Would they suffer the same effects as humans and suffer heart issues, or be completely unaffected?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a Eureka moment soared through the white haired girl as she shampoo\u2019ed and conditioned her hair. She could gain weight without the consequences!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guys like little sister figures, some even twisted enough to be aroused by incest. She and Shiro are siblings but not by blood. And Shiro does like being called \u2018big brother\u2019 by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guys like loli-like physiques or young girls in general. Shiro didn\u2019t seem to care except for chubby girls above a suitable age. Ilya is seventeen despite having a twelvish/thirteenish body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome guys like girls with out-of-this-world characteristics, such as Ilya\u2019s white hair and eyes. Shiro doesn\u2019t seem to mind though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can become the full package for him! He wouldn\u2019t need no indecent magazines! She would be all he needed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a confident smile, Ilya stepped out of the shower, dried off, and put on her new clothes. She walked out and deposited her dirty gym outfit in the laundry room and walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was greeted with Taiga, now with her hair back to her normal sheen and splendor and looking normal, unlike earlier she looked like a Dead Apostle reject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was Shiro slaving over a hot stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning big brother!\u201d Chirped Ilya as she walked to the kitchen table and took  a seat. \u201cMorning Miss. Taiga!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019 squirt,\u201d smiled Taiga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning to you too Ilya,\u201d said Shiro as he looked over his shoulder and smiled. \u201cI am making pancakes, you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiro don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Chuckled Taiga. \u201cLittle Ilya is on a diet so she can\u2019t have-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take two stacks big brother!\u201d Taiga\u2019s know-it-all visage changed to confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing right up!\u201d Smiled Shiro with a monster grin as he poured more batter into the pan and worked with a boon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaiga raised an eye at the small girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry!

Taiga settled for one silver dollar while Shiro was about to sit down before his head perked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right,\" he mused. \"Sausage and bacon.\" Ilya has already started buttering her flapjacks and grabbing for the syrup on the table to lather her breakfast. Taiga had a confused eyebrow as she drank her coffee slowly as she stared at the white haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She must have ran herself ragged or something to be THIS hungry,' thought the teacher to herself. \u2018Ah what the hell,  let her eat her breakfast.\u2019 She gave a shrug as she set her cup down and began to cut up her pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro turned back to the stovetop and began to cook the breakfast meats. \u201cYou girls want some sasuage and bacon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take four of each!\u201d Chirped Ilya as she finished preparing her pancake meal, now slathered in maple syrup, and began to cut them up into bite size pieces with a fervor, setting the bites to the side to make a pile of some sorts. Shiro nodded as he smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk and ye shall receive,\u201d he remarked as he turned over the bacon on one pan and rolled the sausages around in the other. Ilya quirked her eyebrows and gave a smile. She looked down, licking her chops at the bite size morsels she has carved out, lathered in fatty butter and sugary syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018One bite for Shiro,\u2019 She inserted her fork into the bite, recalling the speech of some astronaut she saw on the \u2018television\u2019. \u2018One giant bite to fatness!\u2019 And bit down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd flew into an eating frenzy, her fork going up and down quick and with a decent pace. Her taste buds savored the taste buds of the pancake and the syrup, but keeping a steady flow of the meal into her gullet in order to pack away the most food. Her mouth kept moving, chewing the pancake morsels down fast. After going through half of her pile(which consisted of two flapjacks) she saw Taiga staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018But then again\u2026I should keep my manners, Shiro wouldn\u2019t like me as a slob,\u2019 Ilya reminded herself, taking her napkin and cleaning her mouth. She took a sip from her water glass, breathed a little\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd returned to her flapjacks, but went slowly with a regal grace. Taiga shrugged and returned to her own pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll done!\u201d Chirped Shiro as he finished the cooking of the sausages and bacon, turning off the stove top and placing the meat to the side, and lightly touching them with paper to drain the grease out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Cheered Ilya as she cleared her second pile, making a total of four pancakes down into her stomach, a small and noticeable bulge on her abdomen as she has only two pancakes left. Taiga has finished her already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to head to Furinkan for a teacher meeting and checking up on the final touches to my classroom, so I\u2019ll be back around four today,\u201d Taiga stood up and went out of the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty,\u201d said Shiro as he finished de-greasing the meats and sat down at the table, having one pancake and two sausage links and bacon strips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you big brother!\u201d Smiled Ilya. \u201cYour food is great!\u201d She proceeded to take four links and strips, even as she started on her final two stacks. Shiro smiled at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d replied back the orange haired teen. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be of service. It\u2019s quite clear you liked it.\u201d He noticed her syrupy yet still packed plate, even as Ilya gulped down a pancake bite she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you did cook it big brother, and it was really tasty and I-\u201c She stopped herself. She doesn\u2019t want to spoil him JUST yet. Maybe catch his eye with her eventual gain overtime, then she can put the moves on her benefactor, with added curves and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Ilya, you\u2019re drooling.\u201d Pointed out Shiro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d Ilya wiped her mouth with the napkin. \u201cSorry about that. I was about to say I am really looking forward to what you\u2019ll make in the future!\u201d She mewed as she ate more of her pancakes. Shiro returned the grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy to help.\u201d Shiro then started on his own breakfast, going at it slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big brother?\u201d She finished her one stack, and one of her hands went to her stomach to rub it, the fullness evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever thought of going to culinary school? I mean,\u201d Ilya stared at Shiro, her big red eyes staring into Shiro\u2019s golden-brown. \u201cWith your skills and touch to cooking, you can make a lot of money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Nodded the boy. \u201cAlthough if I want my cooking to be used, I\u2019d rather employ it where everyone can enjoy my food, like at a diner or a restaurant or something. Going into culinary school would also be expensive as well, and I\u2019d have to move out of Fuyuki. Then comes the problem with opening a restaurant, then renting the land, paying the landlord, buying all the utensils, and ingredients, etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya blinked. \u201cWow\u2026I never knew that opening a diner would be so complex! It almost sounds like magecraft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere it so easy,\u201d mumbled the teen, taking a sip of orange juice. \u201cAnd besides, I only have one year left in high school. But,\u201d he turned towards Ilya, patting her head. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely take what you said into consideration Ilya.\u201d Ilya beamed, returning to her food and eating with a gusto, scarfing her meats down quickly and finishing her pancake stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" She gulped down the last bite. \"Full...\"</span></div></div>",

Gaining weight is gonna be tough, but, if this pain allows her to eventually put on lots of weight than so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Besides,' She thought.

Ilya managed to sit up, using her palms to help balance herself and she looked at her newly engorged stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa...nice!'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a normal day in the Einzbern castle, not a soul was stirring, with the exception of a certain red-eyed albino. The adorable loli, Ilya, was wandering the castle halls, looking rather irked. \"It's not fair! It's not fair! It's not fair!\" she childishly repeated, \"Sella won't let me do anything fun with her! It's like she was designed to bore me!\". And unfortunately for her, Sella wouldn't let her have fun with Leysritt either, who was also stuck cleaning with the boring maid. Left to her own devices, Ilya figured if her maids wouldn't entertain her, she'd find a way to have fun on her own. So it was with that thought that she started moving to a different part of the castle, one that she rarely frequented. Since it's construction, she'd rarely had to visit the room that stored her family's mystic codes, due in part to the fact that she once had the strongest servant, berserker, the Greek hero Hercules, at her beck and call. Figuring she was bound to have the entire day to herself, she'd thought to discover what kinds of tools her ancestors once used. Weaving her way through the maze like halls, she managed to finally make it to a door that look far more elaborate than the rest. Inside there were countless tools to be found. However, out of all the tools found in the storage room, her eyes settled on one in particular...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Picking up the gun, Ilya gives the tool a long glance, observing the many complexities of its design. Unlike the many firearms her father, Kiritsugu,had infamously used, she'd never seen anything quite like this. In fact, it almost looked like a child's toy. Then again, what did she know about modern day weapons? But that still begs the question, what was something like this doing in a storage room meant to hold enchanted tools? Last she checked, bar her father, no magus had been known to even glance at modern day weaponry, deeming it inferior. So many questions, and only one way to get them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she tried to spot something that could be used as a target. Before she could settled on a bullseye, she turned to see an automated golem rushing her. <br>\r\n\"Most likely the security system\" she thought to herself. Looks like the system made her choice a lot easier. She smirked, pointing the gun at the still rushing contraption. <br>\r\n\"Hope Sella and Leysritt won't mind the extra work\" she thought. Unfortunately it seemed like fate had other plans for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the trigger once, twice, and would have squeezed it again had she not been about to get pulverised by the now encroaching golem! Figuring safety overtook her curiosity, she instinctually reinforced herself quickly and tried to put as much distance between herself and her attacker. Managing to put roughly ten yards of distance between each other, Ilya caught her still held breath, allowing oxygen to finally flow through her again. Keeping her magic circuits running, she prepared a spell to obliterate her aggressor. That was another mistake. Not being very well versed in hand to hand combat, any opportunity given to an opponent will be exploited, and exploit it the golem did. Having not put enough distance between them, she only had realised her mistake as she saw the golem overtake the distance between them in a heart beat. Seeing it wind up its massive arm as it came within striking distance, Ilya used the only other thing at her disposal. She remembered her father talking to her about reinforcement magic, and how it can be used to, well, reinforce objects as well. However, done incorrectly, said object can explode if there is too much mana running through it. In a last ditch attempt, she closed her eyes on instinct and reinforced the gun, hoping to detonate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Nothing happened. She quickly opened one eye, hoping that the golem had missed. Instead, she found herself staring at a golem that appeared to be missing the limb used to strike. No wait, that's incorrect, while it looked that way, upon closer inspection one could see a tiny arm where the large arm was supposed to be. It almost looked comical, and it would've been funny if the golem, now recovered, hadn't decided to throw it's other arm at her. Now Ilya, being the smart woman that she is, put two and two together and, while grinning mischievously, fired again with her circuits running. Hitting it's other arm, she could see it's size dwindling as it neared closer and closer, until it was no bigger than it's other arm. Now confident in her victory, she fired again, this time it hitting the poor security contraption dead-center. Like previously observed, the golem started getting smaller and smaller, until it was no bigger than her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're just adorable like this!\" She exclaimed as she picked up the now toy sized golem. The golem, seemingly annoyed with her attempts at mockery, tried fighting back, earning a giggle from the loli. \"Unfortunately, you'll just keep bothering me, so I'll destroy you now.\" and proceeded to crush it in her hand. Refocusing her attention on the gun that had both almost killed her and saved her life, she once again looked over the gun \"So you make things smaller, huh? And you need to be fed mana for it to work. Makes sense.\" While she normally would not have felt much from simple reinforcement, she had indeed felt a small strain on her circuits. Finishing her observations, she noted that, there were a set of buttons on the gun, specifically a 'G' and an already highlighted 'S'. Figuring 'S' meant shrink, she immediately deduced that the 'G' must've been for enlarging things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new source of entertainment, Ilya thought \"Growing things, shrinking things, ohhhh the possibilities!\" She smiled mischeviously, an idea forming in her head...</span></div></div>",

But that was fine, for Shiro returned, and Sakura's happiness has finally born fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin Tohsaka, their ally and Sakura's sister surprisingly, has made up for time with her long lost sister and she left to return London a week ago to return to her studies at the Clock Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Servant Rider, or otherwise known as Medusa, she couldn't have been happier for her Master. To be free from that devil of an old man and her insane brother.

To be fair, she is entirely new to this TV, but she does find it...amusing. The oblong cutsey anime, or some outrageous game-show where they do belly flops into a pool, or even the sport called \"Baseball\". The lavender haired woman gave a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wish I had someone like Shiro...' The last Servant would never dream of stealing Shiro away from Sakura, the purple haired girl has been through enough misery in her life. All Rider would want is to find someone maybe like Shiro.

Ah to be so fortunate to be blessed with such capable chefs is quite a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile of the lavender hair woman turns slightly mischievous. It was no secret to anyone really how obvious their crushes to each other are (while aside from the couple themselves surprisingly), how could she not take any opportunity to just do a little prodding before the two of them would look away with faces burning red. Never gets old really, how adorable the two of them really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich makes the...*ahem* \"Mana Recharge\" sessions all three of them have together all the more surprising. How they act in public and how they act in the bedroom, such a contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRider's naughty smile widens a bit more before going back to a more content expression. Sexual escapades aside she did wonder how the both of them will react with the little surprise she has in store for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEars pick up the sound of footsteps coming from the front. <i>'Ah speak of the devil.'</i> She turns towards in the direction of the front doorway, ready to greet her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're home Rider.\" The boy, Shirou, is the first voice the gorgon hears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're hungry.\" A second voice, of the young girl Rider calls Master, adds in as the couple soon enter through the hallway leading up the dining room, \"The market was...having...a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers stopped in their tracks and Rider had to suppress the chuckle that threatening to leave her mouth. \"Ah Sakura, Shirou.\" She greets the duo standing dumbstruck before getting up from sitting at the table, \"Do you require a hand with your bags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red hair boy drops the plastic bag he had in his left hand, freeing it so he can raise to point a finger at her, stuttering all the while, \"R-r-r-i, e, d-der. You're...you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura herself was quiet, both hands raised to cover her mouth as her purple eyes widen at Rider's \"surprise\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be greeted by the voluptuous woman is not a rare occurrence ever since after the Holy Grail War. Sometimes she'll be out doing odd jobs around Fuyuki to add in expenses, other times she'll go out for the night participating of her hobby of street racing. What is rare though is to come in with the woman wearing some lingerie that leaves little to the imagination, which when used with the already alluring figure would have made lesser men (and maybe women) faint. Though there was one key difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" Medusa says as she places her right hand to her midriff, on a belly that look like it belongs to a woman who is 9 months pregnant with a child, a sight that was most absolutely not been there the previous day. In a liquid motion she rubs her hand over the expanded surface, \"Is my latest addition really that shocking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow logically, yesterday Rider wasn't that late into a pregnancy, or rather wasn't even pregnant at all. But the sudden shock for the two teenage magi had override any mental processes to differentiate the truth, reducing the two of them into stuttering blobs. Well one stuttering blob for Sakura, Shirou....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A father, I'm going to be a father.\" The red hair young man mutters as he stares off into space, \"Is it even possible to get a Servant knocked up? It's common sense that when pin A goes into hole B may result into baby C. Ritual or not, it's still sex no matter how I cut it. Oh god what would Rin think? What would everyone at school think? OH GOD, WHAT WOULD FUJI-NEE THINK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura herself, still had her hands to her face and blushing fiercely, \"Oh she's pregnant, she's pregnant. I'm jealous of her, but I'm happy for her. Oh no what should we do? Baby showers, take her to a doctor, wait can doctors work on Servants? I mean she's a woman, and woman can get pregnant. Wait then what does that make me, the auntie, the step mother, hauhhhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Better reaction than I expected.'</i> Rider notes before clearing her throat gaining her charges' attention. \"My apologies, but...\" She swipes her hand over her abdomen. As if by magic (heh) Rider's belly deflated and shrinks before going back to her smooth tone that was there yesterday. \"I just came across an amusing trick earlier and just wanted to see your reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Shirou gulps as if a dead man dying of thirst, \"No baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\" She answers earning a sigh of relief from the two teenagers. \"I'll explain later after dinner, when the Fujimura woman is done mooching of us.\" Satisfied, Rider soon goes back to the table, picks up her book, and continues on from where she left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, Sakura and Shirou pick themselves before proceeding onto the kitchen to prepare dinner, occasionally sneaking glances towards Rider's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Servant's grins at the display, <i>'Truly such amusing companions I've been blessed with.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-0-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, a certain Tiger wasn't able to come to dinner that night. Calling on the phone, wailing that she had to take care of an overload of exams to grade and other paperwork a teacher had to handle, ultimately missing out on the feast lying just beyond the reach of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirou himself was actually glad at the sudden turn of events. Fuji-nee will no doubt raise hell on seeing Rider with a swollen belly, that would raise too many question. Come to think of it, having Rider sitting at the table reading a book while in lingerie would have been more than enough to raise the Tiger's wrath. After promising to leave a (large) portion of leftovers for later he hands up and makes his way to the table, where Sakura and Rider with (to his dismay) her belly back to bloated state. Sakura herself was already gazing at the expanded flesh, as if waiting for something to kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I just finished up with Fuji-nee, I think we have the evening to ourselves Rider.\" says Shirou, eye focus on Rider's face and trying desperately to not look down, \"So can we please know what just happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am quite curious.\" Sakura adds in, \"We just want to make sure that there might be a problem with my connection to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRider gives a calming smile, \"There's no problem with our link Master. It's just that when I reading I've noticed I've been building a surplus of prana within myself. Curious I tried shifting it around and before I know it.\" She gestures towards hey stomach, \"Naturally I was quite surprise at the development but it wasn't painful or cumbersome really aside having to strip to my underwear to make room that's all. In truth,\" She rubs a hand over the skin, \"it's been food for though at the very least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Sakura speaks up, \"Can you...get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Rider returns, \"As a Servant, my body is not flesh and blood but of ultimately nothing more than prana. It maybe possible I can expand myself beyond what a normal human should be capable of.\" She chuckles, \"But I rather not expand myself to a degree that I lose mobility. That will be blow to my pride as a Servant of the Rider class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earn a laugh all around before dinner continue as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-0-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right we're going out Rider.\" Sakura, dressed in her school uniform, says as she leaves with Shirou right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Servant herself waves them goodbye, \"Have a good day.\" She then watches the two disappear behind the hillside leaving the gorgon by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Such pleasantries.'</i> She thinks to herself as she head backs inside. Locking the door behind her she makes her way to her own room, stripping off as she does so before she's back to her underwear. Though yesterday Rider had said that the expansion process has been food for though she neglect to mention the budding curiosity as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fun part.\" Rider says to herself as she builds up prana within herself and smiles at the results. Pale pink eyes focus as the Servant's once trim belly slowly starts ballooning out. Rider places her hands on her expansion, feeling the flesh of her belly stretch out to accompanied the addition she added to herself. The experience itself is surprisingly pleasant, with her stomach itself having the right combination of being soft to the touch while being firm enough to not look like sagging belly fat. Rider marvels at the display and wonders what else can she do from here?</span></div></div>",

Caster isn't sure what to make off the spells she finds within the pages of the spell-book but she is determined to find one that will give her a desirable result. Soon enough Caster finds one and decides to use it right away. Caster opens up a magic circle and begins to chant the spell in question. After chanting the spell, a wind bursts into the room and hits Caster. Her magic circle disappears and she falls to the ground landing on her butt. Caster gets up and looks to see that nothing has happen to her. However before Caster can give a sigh of disappointment, her breasts start growing. Caster is unable to believe her eyes, her spell worked and now her normal size chest was growing larger and larger. Caster breasts bust out of her outfit and stop growing around the size of fully inflated basketballs. Caster still has a bra covering her boobs and it seems like it would hold out even if Caster got even bigger. Caster grabs her big melons and instantly realizes something. Her breasts were inflated.

They're just taking the easy way to win over fans!\" the lancer grumbled to herself as a certain, and currently inebriated, roman empress stumbled about with a chest that looked to be mere-moments away from escaping her top.  \"A REAL idol knows that a slim figure is the best kind of figure for attracting men!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was energy in the proclamation but it still rang hollow in the pointed ears of the girl, what meager strength she'd built up leaving her all to quickly as she slouched over, her chin resting in her hands and her elbows on her knees as she watched the room, the normally boisterous girl now turned into a wallflower as her master was surrounded by women whose bodies outclassed her in every aspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth may refer to herself as petite but it was simply a way of making her figure more palpable, a method of coming to terms with the nonexistent chest, twiggy legs, and flat rear that made up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomanly features were, unfortunately, lost to the draconic servant, the leather straps on her chest and flowing skirt she wore only emphasizing her lack of a figure rather than hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally the lancer wouldn't have cared but time had caused her feelings for Gudao to evolve beyond a simple friendship or bond, it had begun blossoming into an unfamiliar, but not unwelcome, love.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now that flower was being choked out by others that were growing around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party wore on and her master was eventually dragged away by a few of the other servants, Elizabeth came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

Stop cooking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man frowned but continued to cook, a small stir-fry sizzling in the wok as he stirred it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formal name of the man was Emiya Shirou but he'd long insisted that he be called by his class instead, something that had caused confusion on more than once when the call for 'Archer' had gone out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Lancer?\" the servant replied, only the barest bit of attention granted to the girl who now leaned on the counter that separated the kitchen from the cafeteria \"If you're here to sing, I would rather do without the headache for a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl bristled slightly at the comment on her voice and instead decided to get right to business asking the man, in a voice that was a tad too loud, \"What kind of woman do you like?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wasn't certain if it was possible for someone to choke on nothing but the cough made by the red man and the spatula nearly flying from his hand showed that it must surely be possible for such a thing to occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?\" the man asked once he regained his ability to speak , brows knitted in a frown \"Who asks that sort of thing out of the blue like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth frowned in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not into you if that's what you're asking!\" the pink haired girl returned, long, pink nails drumming on the counter \"This idol only has eyes for someone else, so you don't need to worry about trying to live up to my standards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp retort, oddly enough, calmed the man down and a brief flash of his eyes between the girl and someone farther back in the room was all it took for realization to dawn on him....Not that he let such a thing pass without a biting retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do believe that 'I' like girls who don't have the personality reminiscent of a constantly barking dog,\" the man said with a slightly smug grin, saving the way the lancer's nails tapped against the top of the counter that much hard \"a meeker, kinder personality is more 'my' speed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm plenty kind!\" Elizabeth answered, straightening up and resting a hand on her lacking chest, \"Why, I don't make anyone here pay to listen to my songs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcher doubted that such a thing counted as 'kind' when the singer was as tone-deaf as Liz but he kept such thoughts hidden, instead continuing with the question he'd been posed with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also enjoy women who can cook but I would....highly encourage you to stay away from such things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no argument form the idol on this topic as not only was cooking beneath one of her stature, she was quite aware that her qualities as a chef were lacking in the extreme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly,\" the man said as he transferred the stir-fry to a waiting plate, \"I appreciate a woman with curves and a bit of softness to her, it makes her look more feminine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's gaze went from the plate to Liz, her reaction being......less than enthusiastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me to get FAT?\" the girl asked, a looked of disgust mixed with shock on her face \"Do you know what that would do to my career as an idol!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nothing that hasn't already been done by yourself' was the response Archer wanted to give but \"No, I'm just telling you to put on a few pound  for curves\" was the answer he actually put out, taking the time to put a heaping plate of the fresh stir-fry before the girl. \"You're the one who has to make the call, not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, archer dismissed Liz, giving the other member's of Chaldea their servings while the thin lancer look at the loaded plate before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few more curves.....\" the girl murmured to herself as she briefly sent a look back towards her master as he tried to maintain an uneasy peace between the purple haired 'demi-servant', whatever that meant, known as Mashu and a white haired, red eyed berserker known as Kiyohime, the former's substantial chest and the latter's wide hips pressing against the man as he navigated through a rather testy situation.</span></div></div>",

<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's head started to hurt a bit too much whenever she tried to contemplate the existence(s) of the women (woman?) known as Arturia Pendragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'king' of Camelot as she'd been known in a former life was a petite woman with blue eyes, golden hair held up in a bun, and a youthful figure not unlike Liz's...although it was perhaps a tad more difficult to notice beneath the saber's silver armor and flowing blue dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Arturia was seated on Liz's left and spoke in the suffering idol's defense, speaking to the version of her seated to Liz's right, an 'evil' version called 'Arturia Alter' with gold eyes, sickly, pale skin, and blonde hair that was a tad more listless than her original counterpart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also ditched her armor for a black, gothic style dress that showed off her petite chest but that was far from the biggest difference between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a ruler cannot rule without practice!\" the original said through a healthy bite of steak, a small stack of plates next to her, \"This may be but the first step she takes towards learning to properly enjoy a well cooked meal!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement was met by a small 'that's right' from a figure across the table that looked like the 'original' Arturia if she'd aged a few years and gained a substantial increase in chest size, a tight blue tunic showing off a healthy amount of cleavage from the woman's melon sized breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was known as Arturia Lancer and she'd been one of the first, to Liz's irritation, to replace her in Gudao's lineup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a poor showing if that's true,\" responded alter with a mouthful of greasy burger, it's wrapper added to a pile of its fallen compatriots \"it show's that she's got no talent for eating if a meager meal of meat and rice is enough to defeat her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like with her 'original' compatriot, Arturia Alter was backed up by a nod from Lancer Alter, a dark mirror to Lancer Arturia just as Alter was a mirror of the smaller saber, her own chest just as larger as her 'good' counterpart and contained in a tight sweater that showed off a healthy amount of underboob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement, of course, earned a response from the original which earned a response from Lancer Alter which earned a response from Lancer Arturia until the four of them were locked in a massive discussion about whether Liz's failed attempt at gluttony was a good thing or a bad thing, leaving Elizabeth and Arturia Lily, a younger, more innocent version of the original, out of the conversation entirely, the later poking at a small slice of cake with a cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me....\" The pink haired lancer groaned while giving her stomach a rub \"Why can't things ever be simple for once....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the words of golden eyed saber were enough to get Elizabeth to pick up her fork and choke down a few mouthfuls of food, doing her best to ignore the pain in her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all for master.</span></div></div>",

That voice....\" groaned Liz as she turned to find a familiar figure standing behind her, a golden goblet nearly overflowing with wine clutched in one hand \"As if things weren't bad enough...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the new arrival ignored the look of dismay on the lancer's face with an overly loud, haughty laugh, the strength of the action causing her sizable chest to bounce within the white leotard she wore beneath her crimson dress, a few new, purple stains marking the clothing as the woman's over-exaggerated movements sent the dark liquid splattering from it's cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnown as Nero Claudius Ceasar Augustus Germanicus, the saber class servant was well known within Chaldea for her over inflated ego, haughty, attention seeking personality, and singing voice that only rivaled Liz's in its 'quality', or lack thereof. In appearance, she closely resembled saber Arturia but for green eyes, more prominent, blonde bangs, and breasts the size of grapefruit, much to the 'original's' displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also short, shorter than even Liz at a few inches below five feet, and her clothing was nothing short of scandalous, the bright red dress showing off her cleavage and a good section of her back and rear, along with a see-through fabric that allowed everyone to see her bare thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was probably the pink haired Lancer's best friend, although neither would admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the victory feast, Lancer?\" The girl shouted a bit to loudly, a wide grin plastered on her face \"I'll admit that the meats are far less succulent than what I had back in Rome but they filling in their own way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time for a response was far too brief for Liz to even consider answering, the saber class servant taking a deep swig of her wine before she began speaking once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to engage in feasts five times the size of this one back in my rule! Once a month I would show all the splendor of Rome with such foods that you can only dream of! There was succulent pigs, fine, fresh fruits, and wines taken from master vintners who could turn even the most tasteless of grapes into masterful works of blah blah blah blah-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress was well renowned for her long winded tirades about the glories of Rome under her rule and, as such, everyone within Chaldea had slowly developed a 'Nero Survival Instinct' that kicked in once the girl started going, their expression falling slack, their eyes growing dim, and their body shifting into an auto-pilot like state that allowed them to function without requiring them to pay attention to the petite woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in this instance, it had some rather interesting effects on the 'dragon idol'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Nero's tirade got into full swing, much of Bathory's brain shut down, including the portion that was informing her of the pain she felt from her overburdened stomach and the portion that controlled her 'fullness', leaving naught but an empty void to be filled with foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began Liz's true stuffing for the evening, her blank eyes locked on Nero while her fork shoveled ever greater amounts of food into her gullet, the empress soon leading the girl to another, empty table where they no longer had to worry about the escalating situation that had come about with the Arturias, the girls now at nearly open bloodshed but for the youngest incarnation who still happily picked at her cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at their new table that Liz's gorging really took hold, the girl clearing her first plate and getting yet another plate with Nero, the empress demanding great plates of food from the red archer in the kitchen who obeyed without question, if only so he could get her to leave sooner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, the plates began to stack up around the two, along with another addition from Nero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fine meal like this needs a fine wine to go with it!\" Liz heard in one of the moments where her brain detected something of relevance in the motor mouth's raving, the roman empress's slurring getting worse and her stomach looking a bit bloated in her tight dress. \"It raises ones spirits and ensures a healthy body! Good wine's lead to a good life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was not unfamiliar with wine, she'd often partaken in the drink at banquets during her life, but she'd yet to truly indulge in such a thing due to the understanding that people wanted a 'Pure, innocent idol, not a drunken, stumbling singer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, however, well aware of what too much wine could do to a person, giving them something far from a 'healthy body'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beer belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been in a more, fully functioning state of mind, Liz would've rejected her rival's offer of the alcoholic drink but, at this moment, she was not in that state of mind and, as such, she accepted her rival's offer, downing a full goblet and indulging in what could only be considered wanton debauchery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoblet after goblet was spilled between the two girls and what was a once the Saber dominating the conversation soon turned into the pair giggling and drunkenly singing side by side as they clattered their goblets together and stuffed themselves full of more food, their dishes having moved from the nutritious meals of Emiya to the empty calories of heavily frosted cakes and sugary pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the effects were plain as day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been minor bloating and a bit of tightness for the pair had turned into sweet and liquor laden guts that strained against their dresses, the girls looking like they were in early stages of pregnancy, something only allowed by the durability of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know Ne-hic-ro, I really.... REALLY wish I'd done this b-buhfore,\" came the happy, and heavily slurred, proclamation from the idol, her wide smile showing off her elongated canines \"Y-you and me are two of uh kind...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-umu~.... O-on that we can agree Eliz...Elizab....Lizzy.\" The empress slurred back, the short woman swaying slightly as she rested her hand upon her chest \"T-together we could be.. UNBEATABLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing especially humorous about Nero's near shout but the pair devolved into drunken giggling anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was nearly empty by this point as the many people present retired to their rooms, fallen dead asleep or, in the case of all Artorias but lily, driven themselves to exaustion....but Gudao still remained, the tired looking young man sitting around a small gathering of servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the alcohol or perhaps it was her patience finally reaching its limits but either way, the outcome was the same for Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away from her friend, who fell dead asleep as she lay upon the now vacated seat, the lancer class servant drunkenly stumbled across the room until she was in front of her master, the black haired young man noticing her arrival with a surprised, but still warm, smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, are you alright?\" the man asked as a bloated, and swaying, girl stood before him, her youthful features locked in a puffy cheeked pout. \"I didn't see you all night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't h-hu-help that you've been spending your time with all those other girls...\" the pink haired idol slurred, an awkward cough escaping a few of the remaining female servants \"I almost thought you'd forgotten about you're number one Idol!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao was on his back foot but, as always, the young mage reacted quickly, putting up a reassuring smile and gently holding the inebriated girl on her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't forgotten you Liz, it's just been a long day a-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long?!\" came the loud outburst from the servant, her pout now taking a shade of anger \"D-do you know how LONG it's been since you brought me out and showed off my talents to the w-world? How do you expect me to b-be an idol without an audience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deathly quiet seemed to fall over the party as the lancer's indignant complaints continued, the girl listing off all the days she'd waited for him to call upon her and her spear once more, the man sitting and taking it all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was one of the first to help you out and now I've been left behind! Forgotten!\" the idol drunkenly raged, her scaled tail thrashing as she wobbled from side to side \"Well, if you think you can forget me! Then try and forget this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that Gudao managed was a surprised 'wha-' as Elizabeth Bathory, the Blood Countess and Lancer class servant, fell onto him and gave him a deep, wine-tinted kiss....promptly before falling asleep atop his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPounding, thunderous and painful was the sensation the greeted Elizabeth in the morning when she awoke, a splitting headache unlike any other she'd had before welcoming her into the new day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-shoulda held back....\" the girl moaned, her hand coming to her head to nurse the painful drums playing in it \"N-never gonna drink again..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and painfully, Liz managed to open one of her pale blue eyes, fighting against to the harsh light to find herself. </span></div></div>",

I'm in master's bed!\" Elizabeth cheered to herself in her head, her face flushing pink \"I-I made it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste such a golden opportunity, the small bit of embarrassment Liz felt about laying on the half-clothed man's chest was shoved into the furthest reaches of her mind as she nuzzled deeper into the blankets, enjoying their shared warmth while ignoring her upset stomach and pounding head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long had it been since they last did this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA two months? Three? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken some time in the early days for the pair to become comfortable enough for such a thing, and even then they'd done it rarely, maybe once or twice a week at most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had loved those days, the feeling of skin upon skin, although her pride as an idol had prevented them from taking it any farther, their late nights spent cuddling instead of performing more...carnal acts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, I m-may, MAY consider it once I win him back,\" the lancer thought as, the still sleeping Gudao pulled her tighter in his sleep \"j-just to make sure he's m-mine!...IF he asks....Maybe...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, she may not have been one hundred percent certain about going through with such an act, she wasn't the debase empress after all, but a small opening in a door had been opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor fifteen minutes the draconic girl enjoyed the feeling of her master, the thumping of his heart, the slow in-hailing and exhaling of his breath, her slim hips lightly wiggling and the thick, fin tipped tail she had wagging all the while, a peaceful bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bliss that was all too soon shattered when the intercom in the boys room crackled to life, the familiar voice of Da Vinchi calling the man down to 'mission control' for a meeting, the boy groaning a bit before finally awakening with a sigh, his arm rising to the run his hands through the hot pink locks of Elizabeth who, in the hopes of getting some more 'me' time with him, feigned slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a few more minutes!' the idol thought, the girl doing her hardest to look relaxed 'Let that weirdo wait! You have me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for a time, the girl's master stayed, stroking her hair and holding her close as he quietly mused on some thought all his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, duty called and it wasn't too long before Liz was left alone in the bed, her master hastily dressing himself as quietly as he could, the girl now sporting an irritated pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Chaldea...\" the girl muttered, enjoying the lingering scents of the man in his bed \"He saved the world! Can't he get some time off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when the dying warmth of Gudao finally left the sheets did Liz stand from the bed and inspect herself to see last nights results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were...underwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill left dressed by her master, an act that left the girl feeling happy but disappointed, Liz found that her chest was still flat, her thighs still trim, and her rear still small, the only hints of last-night's gorging being a small, poochy belly in place of her normally flat one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz did not take it well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT!\" she shrieked in anger, arms at her head \"DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT! I need hips and breasts not a belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what could only be described as a childish tantrum, Elizabeth stomped around the room, flailed about, and stomped her feet, the girl venting her frustrations until she tripped herself up, a shrill 'eeeeep!\" escaping her as the idol tumbled to the floor with a nasty 'thump'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuuuuuu...\" came the wordless groan, from the dragon as she recovered from the trip, one cheek puffed out in frustration \"Stupid Nero and her stupid wine and her stupid 'blah blah blah blah bl...ah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the bed, Liz caught sight of a small stack of magazines numbering no more than three, hidden far enough beneath that a casual glance at the bed would miss them but not far enough that once could miss them if they were laying flat on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity over-road common decency and, in a flash, Liz was holding the magazines and sporting an expression that could only be described as complete and utter shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were trembling, her eyes wide, and a small 'awawawawa' sound emanating from her lips as she turned evermore red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPictures of women that could only be described as 'large' filled the pages of the well worn pages of the magazines, their bodies soft and plump, women who looked the exact opposite of the idol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy, perky breasts sat upon full bellies and wide hips flared out skirts that revealed panties stretched to their limits by rears that could fill two seats at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those were the REAL girls, the drawn ones were far bigger than that, some of them so big that Liz doubted they could move had they existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPage after page they came, their acts ranging from the 'innocnet' (resting half naked on a beach towel' to the obscene (one drawing showing a large, belly heavy woman coupling with a normal sized man), each picture causing the girl to short-circuit a little more, her mouth eventually remember its vocabulary and spitting out \"Pervert!\", \"Pig!\", and \"Idiot!\" with increasing speed she finally gave out and slammed the magazine she most recently held shut, her sharp-nails leaving small tears in the paper and steam practically pouring from the girl's pointed ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon idol was at a lost, her mind still shocked beyond thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master likes fat women....\" She mumbled, looking down at her knees \"Master likes fat women....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, it happened, the gears began to turn and Liz's gaze turned towards the small pudge that softened her, otherwise unnoticeable, stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master likes fat women! Thats it!\" She shouted in triumph, her hands in fists and her mouth sporting a wide grin \"That's how I'll get him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goal remained the same but the methods had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer would Liz go for a 'womanly shape', she would simply go for a larger one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bigger one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Liz bolted from the room, a small voice in the back of her asked what would happen to her career as an idol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was answered in traditional Liz fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My singing voice will handle it! My siren song will make them overlook something so petty as a few pounds!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may not have worked for anyone else but for Liz, that answer was enough to justify what was about to happen....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough how it was going to happen was the real question. </span></div></div>",

Who do you think I am?\" Nero responded, still rummaging through her belongings in a position that exposed her panty clad rear in all its glory \"And as for what, I was planning on gathering some other companions and engaging in some, how did Praetor put it, 'moral building'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth put that answer in the 'clear as mud' category and continued picking through the room, her eyes shifting absentmindedly from item to item until one in particular caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting atop a bed-stand next to Nero's 'Empress' sized bed (a queen sized one that she refused to call by its proper name), was a simple, metal picture frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like finding a plastic cup amongst fine china, nothing about the thing marking it out as particularly special or valuable, its contents little more than a smiling Nero that was hugging a surprised looking Gudao, the former holding the latter's arm between their chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sent Liz's rival senses tingling as she picked up the picture, noting the numerous finger prints, and in one case a kiss mark, that smudged the glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plastic cup it may be, but amongst all those other valuable glasses, it was by far the owner's favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if she likes master like I do,' the idol wondered, setting the picture down as Nero let out a shout of triumph 'I know that she started staying a lot more when the others were summoned.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther pondering was put to an end quite quickly, however, for as soon as the lancer turned around, she watched as Nero began to undress in full view of her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz did not take it well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing!\" she shouted, covering her eyes just enough make it look like she couldn't see \"D-don't you have any shame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress ignored her blushing, panicking friend as she hiked down her panties, continuing her bath-time preparations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu? Why should I be ashamed of a thing as beautiful as my body?\" the green aired empress asked, her hands on her hips and her body bare \"If anything, I feel pride in showing my subjects such a fine figure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as much as Liz hated to admit it, the Empress did indeed cut a fine figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSporting an hourglass shape with perky, grapefruit sized breasts and wide, childbearing hips, Nero had little about her body to be semiconscious about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin was flawless, her rear pert and sizable, and even her intimate areas where made appealing by neatly trimming what hair was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Liz, who still hadn't fully come to terms with what she was doing and the minor amount of pudge she now held, pout a bit in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, she thought that her rival's chest may have even been a slight bit bigger than last time, although she quickly dismissed it as paranoia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, are you going to get undressed or not?\" Nero asked, pointing at the idol \"You look like you haven't even brushed your hair yet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's not that bad!\" Liz argued, trying to ignore the frayed locks and slightly ruffled clothes she was wearing \"I-I'll just go back to my room an-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NONSENSE!\" came an almost angry sounding shout from the empress, the girl setting down the things she'd gathered, \"If we're going to spend the day together than we may as well begin now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero was not a women to be denied, no matter how much Elizabeth tried to back out, the empress shutting her down until, finally, Liz relented and began to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also, really didn't help that Nero's gaze was a tad 'focused' on her rival during the whole process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~, you really are my fated rival Elizabeth,\" Nero sighed as the dragon stood nude before her, the <br>\r\ndraconic girl covering her breasts and secret place as best she could \"Even with your...lacking figure, you still manage to make up for such a thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not ALL of us can look like they're part cow!\" Liz barked back, her thrashing tail nearly knocking over some of the roman ruler's things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero, for her part, ignore her friend's retort and instead leaned dangerously close to her friend, eyes locking Liz's soft stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol, trembled under the, strangely quiet, gaze of the empress, her face swiftly going from mortified, to pouting, and angry before cycling back again, her mind racing for something to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that something was to lie through her teeth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's just a little bit of bloating!\" The girl said in her haughtiest tone, adding a small 'humph' for emphasis \"And if I WERE fat, that wouldn't be a problem at all for me, SOME people happen to love large girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for that matter, I happen to know tha- WHAAAA?!\" Elizabeth shrieked in surprise as Nero stood up again, the blonde still as shameless as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I know that some folks enjoy women of that size, I'm one of them!\" the idol's rival said, hands returning her hips and her chest puffing out a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big, small, flat or chesty, I love all women as long as they are cute!\" Nero continued, her declaration loud and proud \"Men as well! Although I get a bit more picky about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz continued to remain silent, standing there in shock until she was finally dragged into the roman empress's private bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour and an awkward bath later, Liz was witnessing the length's that her Saber compatriot would go to when driven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving claimed one of the Chaldea rec-rooms, Nero had filled it with all manner of sweets, drinks, playing cards, and various other types of entertainment for the 'bond building'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this a bit much?\" Liz asked, eyeing a large cake that stood taller than she was, \"I mean, where did you even get this stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None can refuse the will of an empress!\" the saber responded, arms crossed and a smug grin on her space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you basically robbed the store room and bullied that red archer into baking this?\" Liz sighed, her palm meeting her face in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was following a command from his Empress,\" the blonde repeated for emphasis, the girl's ego in full control \"and I 'requisitioned' them. I'd never stoop so low as to steal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy! Who care's how she got it, I say we dig in and start dealing!\" came a loud, rough, but feminine, voice from the curved couch at the center of this decadence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" came another, deeper voice from the couch \"Lets get this going!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third voice joined in but it was simply giggling rather than speaking, its voice far higher than the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, Liz joined her newfound compatriots at the couch, Nero following with a skip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecruited for the 'Bonding' by Nero, Liz found herself sitting with three newcomers to the pair's misadventures, two girls from the class known as rider and one from the class known as assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of the riders was a tall, stunning woman with wild pink hair and a scar on her 'handsome' face that ran from her right brown to the left side of her jaw, tight, white breeches hugging her long, shapely legs and an open jacket showing off her massive, head sized breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rough and tumble girl, as well as being an unabashed hedonist, she'd accepted Nero's invitation without question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second rider, on the other hand, was almost the complete opposite of the first, being a slight girl with soft, pale skin, long, ivory hair that was bound into two massive lengths that were almost as long as she was tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn life, this rider was known as the french queen, Marie Antoinette, a bubbly creature that served as yet another 'idol' inside Chaldea, a rival to Liz and Nero, not that she knew it. Her features were far more feminine than rider Drake but, in return, her hips were less pronounced, giving her a gentle curve, and her chest was FAR less pronounced, being only modest B-cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd signed up for the companionship and, ironically, cake, becoming the most normal of the group but for her overly elaborate hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, there was the assassin known as Jing ke, an androgynous looking woman in a white kimono, the woman's long, black hair held in a ponytail while her long legs and thick thighs were plain as day thanks to the shortness of her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn easygoing figure, she'd signed up due to the promise of alcohol and a little bit of gambling, her hedonistic tendencies rivaling that of Drake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Nero said as she pointed her hand to the sky, \"is everyone ready?\"<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nServants introduced:<br>\r\nRiders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_profile.php?servant=065\" target=\"_blank\">http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_pr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_profile.php?servant=029\" target=\"_blank\">http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_pr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssassins:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJing Ke: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_profile.php?servant=042\" target=\"_blank\">http://fate-go.cirnopedia.org/servant_pr...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We'll make a girls' night of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it!\" Drake roared with a grin, a bottle of wine gripped in her right hand \"Let's live it up tonight! The master's away so the girls will play!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master's gone?\" Liz asked as Nero began to deal out cards, \"Where'd he go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake was too busy draining the wine bottle in long, pulling gulps, seemingly in a race with Jing Ke who was doing the same, to answer but Marie, thankfully took up the torch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was called into Mission Control by Da Vinci early today,\" she said sweetly, a peaceful breeze in the drunken debauchery that was about to take place around them \"It seems that a new singularity of some sort appeared and he went to deal with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief, but fierce, explosion of cards that blocked Liz's view until it cleared for her to see the back of Nero, the short girl having crawled upon the table so that she was nearly nose to nose with Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Praetor left ME behind?\" the empress asked, dread and disbelief coloring her voice \"Me?! But I thought he was going to take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry blondie but it sounds like this one had a bunch of assasins and archers in it,\" Drake said, setting down the now empty wine bottle and grabbing another drink \"The three of us got benched because of it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Marie said with a smile as Nero began to tremble, the queen doing her best to cheer up the empress \"we were left behind as well so you aren't alone today. In fact, we wouldn't be having this party were it not for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero slumped back onto her seat with dead eyes, all energy gone, although Liz more than made up for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why'd he leave me behind!\" The lancer asked, indigent \"I could easily handle whatever archers he'd run into!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the answer came from Jing Ke, her bottle set aside and a half eaten chocolate bar in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After last night's antics he probably thought you were gonna be hungover today,\" the assassin said, a few crumbs falling onto her white dress \"must've left you behind to recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz soon began to mirror Nero in her mood, the pair hunched over at having been excluded from yet another trip with their master, leaving the two riders and the assassin to try and keep the party going before it even started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now come on girls,\" Marie tried, taking the saber and lancer's hands \"just because we missed out on some action doesn't mean we need to be a bunch of sad-sacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" the other ride roared again, slamming her drink on the table and spooking all but Jing Ke with its suddenness \"If we can't FIGHT like hell then we're going to party like HELL! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it may not have been much, the dejected empress and idol did feel their spirits rise just a little bit, some small smiles returning to their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu~ I'll have to agree with you there Captain,\" Nero said, energy returning to her \"I can have some words with our Praetor when he returns, until then we're going to live it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Liz agreed, grabbing herself a veritable slab of cake \"I can talk to master when he gets back, for now I can just get ready for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero may have missed it due to dealing cards and Jing Ke and Drake were too drunk to probably care but that little comment didn't go unnoticed by a certain queen, her grin and tone now a bit mischievous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what are you 'getting ready for'?\" the french queen asked, giggling a little \"A reward for Gudao? Nothing lewd I should hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the evening began with a giggle like that of tinkling bells and a choking idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and tha's when I found that the dog 'ad been shteeling from from the larder!\" Drake said with a laugh, miming holding a pillow in a chokehold \"So I grabbed 'im, took'm to the deck an... an...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake leapt from the couch and slammed the pillow down, laughing all the way to the claps and cheers of the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the alchohol and sweets within the room had been steadily diminishing as the night wore on, the card games (which included a round of strip poker a drunken Nero suggested that was won by Marie) giving way to bad movies and eventually to some story sharing from each of their lives, the most exciting coming from the privateer and empress, although Marie and Jing Ke had also their fair share to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm- Umu~,\" a now heavily inebriated Nero slurred \"Reminds me of my performances in the ar-arena back in the day... Wh-why, once I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz tuned out the empress's story, she'd heard it a thousand times before, and knocked back another glass of some fruity drink that Jink Ke had made, the mixture going down with surprising ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-man Jingy, I never knew you could make alcohol taste so good,\" the idol said with a lick of her lips, setting the empty glass down next to large stack that had grown alongside an equally large mound of plates \"if I knew you could make it taste that good then I'd have drunk more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chinese assassin simply laughed and muttered something about 'poison making' before taking a swig of her own drink, leaving a space that a the white haired rider filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain I would do that if I were you,\" Marie said, the girl slightly more sober than the rest due to filling up on cake \"too much and the only thing you may be greeting Gudao with is a belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz frowned for a moment before turning her gaze downwards to see the fruit of that night's labor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVERY big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been a flat, if softer, stomach was now a very hard, very viable bump that looked like she was entering the late stages of pregnancy, a bowling ball sized bump of food and alcohol that was only possible thanks to her supernaturally tough, servant body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the front of the idol's dress had popped a button or two so that her belly button, now an outie, peeked out along with a solid line of pale flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to the shock of Marie, Liz laughed, the lancer rubbing the orb as she let out a snorting, drunken laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie didn't quite know what to make of the sight, her smile faltering briefly before she gave a confused \"Pardon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Marie, let me, let you, let... let you in on a little secret,\" Liz said in a talk whisper that did nothing to hide her words \"j-just a little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider, now quite interested, leaned forward a bit until her ear was right next to the pink haired girl's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gudao, likes big girls,\" she said with an explosive giggle, pulling away and leaving the white haired queen quite confused \"an...and I'M going to be the biggest.... Gonna get ALL the attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor rider couldn't help but blush at the knew, and quite strange, thing's she'd heard, her own hand going to a midsection that was making her dress look quite tight that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is that true Elizabeth?\" Marie asked again, her mind still struggling to understand what she'd just heard. \"I-I didn't expect our master to have such a... 'unique' taste in women.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's unique alright,\" the lancer said with a wag of her finger and a wink \"I-I found a l-little stack-a magazines under his bed... B-but don't tell anyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie promised but she figured that it wouldn't be all that necessary as, after all, who could believe such an obviously drunk woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne who'd risen to grab an entire plate of chocolate chip cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was lies, it had to be....although, it was strange for a girl like Liz to care so little about her diet, especially when her goal was to be a famous idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick gaze from the rider found that she wasn't the only one who may have been feeling a little 'constricted' that evening as her fellow partiers were showing the effects of the bing as well, Jink Ke's dress bulging out a bit in the middle and Drake's belt was loosened just a bit so that her own stomach could hang free, the middle trimesters of pregnancy plain as day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Nero.... The Empress of indulgence was going to town on the drinks and desserts that evening, her gut nearly as big as Liz's, although Marie was quite certain by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like anything will come of it,\" the queen mused as she decided to spoil herself with another glass of wine \"after all, servant's can't gain weight, our bodies are made of mana after all....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But if that were true, then how are we getting drunk?' a little, niggling voice whispered as the girl felt a familiar tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was ignored and the night ran long....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was if the girls or the goods would give out first by the time Gudao returned. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one entire week, the quintet engaged in a grand feast that could only be described as hedonistic, a month's worth of sweets, delicacies, and drinks vanishing in a gluttonous display of indulgence as they played games, watched movies, or simply lounged about, sharing stories and gossip while they drunkenly awaited the return of Gudao...although by the time he did return, the girls on the couch were far more.... 'plush'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Drake and Jing Ke, it was a week of constant drinking contests that left the pair nothing less than plastered at any moment, the reserves of wine, whiskey, beer, and more drained into the duo's seemingly endless gullets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made drinking games out of card games, drinking games out of movies, drinking games out of video games, and, obviously, contests that ended when one or the other finally passed out, something Drake emerge victorious from due to being the bigger of the two....although they both looked quite big by the end of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sir (or perhaps it should've been Lady) Francis Drake, she ended up finding out that she was blessed when it came to figures, much of the alcohol's effects going to her chest, besides just her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been two, huge, head-sized breasts exploded over the passing days, pale breastflesh oozing out from the tight confines of her jacket while the canyon betwen them grew deer and tighter. Every day they bounced more from her rackus laughter, reaching the size of heavy, heaving bowling balls before continuing on to the size of overripe pumpkins, the button between them straining until it finally flew free with an audible pop, the button striking Nero square in the forehead and revealing to all that she went bra-less, the sight of her perky, rosy nipples only drawing more laughter out of the woman as she downed another drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be outdone, the pirate an privateer's hips and rear had followed after her chest, trim thighs thickening with padding until they threatened to burst the seams of her britches and her buttons swelling to the size of throw-pillows, the seat of her pant's splitting at some point to give a small glimpse of racy, black lace undergarments she wore beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly even grew as well, although not nearly as much as the rest of her, bloating outwards until it was a pregnant looking beer belly that hung free from her top and oozed from where her pants had been undone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA perverse, top heavy hourglass was what the captain ended up with, although non-could tell if she cared due to her constant inebriation, the large grin she wore now set on features that were softer than they'd once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the tall, pink haired woman's rival, the assassin, suffered no better for their competitions either, although she had a far different figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally sporting a trim, leggy figure, the chinese assassin known as Jing Ke ended up with a woman who was far from the optimal shape needed for stealth and infiltration, her once slim stomach bloating outwards at an incredible pace thanks to her love of drink. From nothing to soft pudge it started, a poochy belly that sloshed with liquor until it grew into a lap filling blob of pale flesh that was roughly the size of a beach ball, her gut stretching out her dress to the point that she could rest a plate upon it for easy snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black haired woman's breasts had followed after it as well and, although they grew from palm-able B-cups into hand filling Ds, they were still nothing compared to her overly busty drinking companion, the soft orbs filling out what parts of her top weren't taken up by stomach flesh and giving her a nice slice of cleavage to flaunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, the assassin class servant's short skirt allowed all the watch as her hips widened and her rear thickened with fat, the trim muscle she once used for acrobatics now submerging into soft fat, adding a some meat that was perfect for gripping should anyone have the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar more belly heavy than her rival in drinking, Jing Ke had felt her rising weight and noticed it with indifference, far more willing to indulge in her hedonism rather then worry about how the extra weight would impact her performance, instead opting to continue her competitions with Drake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time for sure you sea cow,\" the rotund assassin said as she slammed down an empty bottle, glaring at her ultra busty rival who'd long since emptied her own bottle. \"some wine went down the wrong tube during that last match!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong tube?\" The rider laughed, her massive chest threatening to uncover itself from her jacket thanks to its bouncing \"There's only one tube for it to go down! I'm thinkin' you just want to fill balloon you call a gut is all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA softer featured assassin pouted at that response but did not deny it, her eyes instead flicking towards Drake's swaying chest as the captain leaned over to give her competitor's soft gut a poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, take it easy you two!\" game a tired sounding, but not unhappy, voice, the french queen taking her time to lecture the pair as she took another, and very large, bite of brownie \"We're running low on drink as it is, do you really want to drain the rest of the wine so quickly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jing Ke and Drake had fully indulged themselves in alcohol, then Marie Antoinette had matched every drink of theirs with a bite from sweets, the pale haired rider gorging herself on whatever baked good crossed her path rather than partaking (heavily) in wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a poise that only the sweetly saccharin noble could manage, Marie had accepted her growing waistline with a smile that was only slightly strained at times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the 'drunk duo, that had guzzled down the drinks, Marie had made short work of many a cookie, tart, cake, or other kind of baked good, picking at them almost constantly over the many days, earning herself a figure that was fairly well rounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever the bustiest of girls, Marie had taken some small pleasure in watching as her petite A-cups swelled with softness until her tight, form-fitting dress was filled-out by some respectable, hand-filling C-cups that she took a small pleasure in admiring, getting them to shake or bounce with little movements....Not that the queen believe it made up for the rest of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she'd once had a taught and trim stomach, Marie now had a doughy middle that made it look like she was in the final stages of pregnancy, a soft, basketball sized orb of doughy flesh that stretched out the fabric of her clothes and oozed out from what few tears it had made, a noticeable pit in the cloth marking the location of her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, the royal's rear and hips had exploded, the pert rear and thick thighs swelling and softening until her skirt didn't cover her bottom so much as it rested atop it, the cloth showing off how her thighs constantly touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more balanced figure, to be sure, but not one that the french idol loved the look of, her cheeks turning a brilliant pink whenever one of the others pointed out the changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that was quickly shown when Jing Ke, with a chuckle muttered about how \"We'll be out of food too if you keep burning through our goodies like that, the princess pouting slightly before taking another large bite from her goodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else could get a word in, though, they were interrupted by a loud, and familiar sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmu~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one for moderation, empress Nero was known to be a hedonist in the extreme during her life, and there was no better example of this then what she'd become thanks to eating and drinking enough to match any of the girls there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer normal, hourglass figure had exploded at the top and bottom, her grapefruit sized breasts swelling in size until they were the size of her head, the soft, pliant flesh overflowing from her top so much that it was nothing short of a miracle that she wasn't exposing herself like Drake had, although the pink tint of her areola peeking out was showing she wasn't far from repeating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips, normally adding a pleasant curve, had grown to match her shoulders in width, the extra inches flaring out her dress's bottom while her own bottom had grow to the size of two overstuffed pillows, the 'back window' of her dress now showing off far more of her 'ass cleavage' than it had before, the backside giving her far more of a cushion than those of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the middle? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gut, a wobbling, fatty stomach the size of a bowling ball that had burst the 'corset' portion of her clothes so that it would shake and jiggle with each movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she LOVED it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hedonist to her core, Nero enjoyed every inch of her new figure, the empress fondling, groping, and feeling up the entirety of her new 'assets' without much care of who was watching, although she did have the presence of mind to stop herself from going any farther....for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, although I'm loathe to admit it, its time.\" the empress said with a smile, hand on her massive breast while she sat a little straighter \"Our feast has been picked clean, our bottles run empty, and our Praetor should return soon. It would only be right to greet him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was...mixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" came a dejected sigh from Marie, the rider wincing slightly as she pinched her stomach \"I-I think I may have to wait on that...Master should not see me in such I'll shape.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no bigger than the rest of us,\" Drake laughed, giving her own stomach a smack \"I'm going just so I can get a look at Gudao's face when he sees these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake hefted her chest up for emphasis, her hands failing to cover even half of them, much to the jealousy of the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably going to put us on a diet,\" grumbled the assassin, trying, and failing, to stand \" -oof-, because I don't think I'll be fighting any time soon.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

There's no romance in that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirate shrugged, unrepentant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I said we were beddin' him, nothing about romance.\" she said in a matter of fact tone, a mischievous smile dancing on her lips \"I mean, its not like he's into fat chicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie looked like she was going to say something but just as quickly shut her mouth, instead pouting and looking for aid from the last member of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth Bathory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid week of gorging, stuffing, drinking, and indulging, Liz had achieved her goal in record time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idol was, without a doubt, fat, a monument to gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leather straps she called a top now, instead of covering a chest like a cliff, cut into soft looking breasts the size of dumplings, something that gave her an inordinate amount of pride despite her flat stomach now bloated out into a plump, pillow sized gut that had begun encroaching into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the older days, the dragon idol may have found her exposed midsection embarrassing but her new drive to claim the eye of Gudao has eased those fears, although she had hoped her chest would've been bigger....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, whatever chest the girl wanted would always pale in comparison to what her lower-body had become though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bottom heavy girl before the gluttonous endeavor had begun (although not by much), the days she'd spent in the rec room with the other girls had turned her hips, posterior, and thighs into something truly monumental. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce firm and tight, Liz's rear had ballooned into such a great size that bowling balls or basketballs could not compare. They easily ate up a cushion on the couch each, their thickly padded flesh pushing her a few inches higher than normal so that she looked down upon the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtop such a colossal bottom rested her skirt like an ornamental decoration, the already short piece of cloth only serving to cover the very top of her rear so that everyone could see how her once cute, pink and white striped panties had been sucked into those giant cheeks, looking more like a thong than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this, the girl's fit thighs had now become great ham-hocks of loose meat that perpetually touched now, the pressure forcing her into an awkward, stumbling waddle whenever she tried to get more snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were her hips, oh how they had grown, the meat so wide that single doorways would prove a challenge, along with practically begging for some kids to be put in...although she wouldn't go quite so far yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, without a doubt, a very heavy pear, her rear outclassing all of her comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she new it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would NEVER do something as crass and casual as that!\" Liz sharply fired back at Drake, the pink haired pirate rolling her eyes \"It would mean that I, as an idol, couldn't get by on pure charm alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Marie agreed, the girl doing her best to ignore Drake's derisive snort, \"I can tell you that it's far less special if it has to happen with a little assistance from liquor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake rolled her eyes but Liz could've sworn she heard a little 'maybe' pass from her lips, the dragon's far thicker tail giving an absentminded way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Besides, I'm not going to need any 'assistance' once this is all done,' the lancer thought to herself with a smile, 'once master gets a load of me, he'll -' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further musings were silences as the familiar voice of Da Vinci sounded over the speaker system, a small alarm ringing behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alert! Gudao and company are coming back from the singularity! All medical staff report to the medbay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medbay?\" the group's assassin murmured as her eyes narrowed, her belly bouncing as she stood \"that's not good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They better not have let him get hurt,\" Drake agreed, bust bouncing as she moved towards the exit of the room \"because I'm going to be seriously pissed if they did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie remained seated and silent, her hands cupped over her mouth in a silent 'No!', her eyes briefly darting towards the remaining sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero was.....Nero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Praetooooooor!\" the girl shouted as she stumbled from her seat, her added bulk and bouncing nearly causing her to trip up \"Noooooooo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Lancer's first instinct was to sprint (See: Waddle) after her rival toward the med-bay but something greater pulled at the idol to head towards the Ray-Shift room where all missions began and ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her figured that there would've been more of a fuss if Gudao had been injured and the other part....well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero already held lead, even if it was an slow one thanks to her unfamiliarity to her new size, and Liz believed that a true idol was NEVER second to her own show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, the dragon blooded girl was more than willing to gamble that Gudao had made it out unharmed and be the first to greet welcome him back rather than be second to greet him in the med-bay....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that's what the Blood Countess had originally planned on before reality gave her a rude slap across the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why -huff- is there -puff- so many -huff- stairs!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like her golden haired rival, Liz had yet to truly adjust to moving father than the snack table with her enhanced figure, her once lively gait now reduced to an awkward stumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once trim thighs now pressed against each other in their entirety, the pressure and sheer volume of meat forcing the idol's legs to pivot in small semi-circles rather than simple lines, a small slapping noise reaching the pointed ears of the servant as she struggled down the halls and down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n To complicate matters even more, Liz was quickly coming to find that doorways were now quite difficult thanks her hips and rear, the former brushing against the sides whenever she went straight in and the latter having to be held in by her hands whenever she went in sideways, although it was still better than if she tried sideways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing in through that particular method resulted in the idol having to such in her overstuffed gut and holding her expanse of a rear in to even have a hope of shimmying through, the girl noting that her long, pink nailed fingers were sinking quite a ways into the pale, pliant flesh before meeting even a hint of resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse than any awkward movements or the strange fatigue Liz felt was the sheer amount of her that was exposed thanks to her increased figure and already minimal clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest, although still lacking compared to the rest of her, was beginning to be pinched quite tightly by the leather straps that made up her 'top', the bands serving more to keep her rose nipples hidden from sight than to give her any real semblance of decency while her soft globe of a stomach basked in the light of the sun, each bounce of flesh visible thanks to having popped all but one of the three buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the idol's skirt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to useless, serving only to keep the front of her panties and 'hidden spot' secret from the rest of Chaldea, the rest of the black fabric resting atop the two, beach-ball sized orbs nearly exposed in their entirety but for the strained remnants of her pink and white striped panties, the cloth sucked into her rear to such an extent that one could've almost sworn the lancer was wearing a thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her newly thickened, black scaled tail did little to provide any semblance of decency, the appendage bouncing off her own buttocks with such force that it was beginning to leave little pink marks that accompanied an audible smacking sound not to dissimilar to if she'd been spanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this lack of proper attire, bouncier sensations, and the shocked gazes that Liz was getting had turned her face bright pink before any sort of strain could do the same, forcing her into the stairwell where she now labored to make her way down to Gudao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was not going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stupid steps -puff- s-should've taken the elevator!\" Liz panted as she struggled down another floor, tail weakly thrashing while she leaned on the rail \"I'm -ugh- gonna be SO gross when I get to master...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an exaggeration, of course, but it should be noted that Liz was a bit red in the face from her exertions, her breathing heavy as she took step after step after step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more step!\" the idol would tell herself as she shakily made her way down, \"You can do it Liz! You're a master idol! You're number ooooAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one of the many steps that the lancer had descended, the girl moved a tad too quickly than she should have, her overly large rear carrying the momentum until the idol was unceremoniously thrown off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's arms spun in circles as she tried to stop the inevitable but, to her horror, she could only watch the world slowly pull away from her as the flabby, pear shaped woman fell down the rest of her current flight, a shriek of fear echoing until it was replaced with a loud, meaty 'thwack' of impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may be a bit obvious to say but the blood countess did not entirely enjoy what was, in essence, a single, hard spank on her much larger rear, a small series of 'ow ow ow ow's slipping from her lips as she tried to ignore the unpleasant, but not entirely so, stinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh.... Master BETTER appreciate this,\" the girl whined as she sat, tears of pain welling up at the corners of her eyes \"because I am NEVER using the stairs again! Not even for hi-eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe complaining came to an abrupt end as a scrawl of white paint on the gray walls of the stair-well caught Liz's eye, the words reading 'Ray-Shift Operations'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been a fierce scowl soon became a bright and sunny smile, the girl awkwardly hauling herself up and sprinting (speed walking) through the door as she let out a high-pitched squeal of 'Maaaaaster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall Elizabeth went, the other staff members dodging out of the way of the bulky servant or getting knocked down by her wide hips if they were too slow, or detracted, to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many people in the corridor but the boy at the end of it was the one she wanted, the tired looking young man laughing with a bespectacled girl with purple hair who pouted up at him, the 'kohai' of the boy undoubtedly disappointed that she wasn't allowed to come with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for them to hear Liz coming either, the duo's eyes turning towards the approaching bulk of the lancer, said eyes bulging not a moment later in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Liz?!\" Gudao stammered as the shorter, but far wider, girl launched into a hug with him, the horns of her head dangerously close to his face as she nuzzled against his chest \"W-what happened to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm SO happy to see you again, master!\" the lancer said with a wide grin, taking in the familiar scent of the magus and utterly ignoring the question \"Do you know how worried I was for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man could only gulp as he tried to ignore the feeling of two, new, soft sensations pressing into him as his servant held him tighter, gaze briefly flickering from the cooing, pink haired girl to the stunned, purple one next to him, the girl known as Mashu, and once the servant known as Sheilder, still shocked beyond words at the exponential increase in Liz's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly.... Leaving me here while you left for a week, how do you think it would reflect on an idol like me if I allowed my master to get hurt?\" Liz said in her usual, haughty tone of voice as she released Gudao from the hug, making sure to instead press her wide hips right against him as she continued \"I can't protect you if you aren't around! I hope you're ready to take responsibility!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFresh from the fight and ambushed by a far larger Liz, poor Gudao kicked into self-preservation mode and replied with a sharp 'Yes!' before he could really process what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's smile was gleaming at the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\" the girl crowed as she  began to lead Gudao towards the elevator, her hot pink hair shifting with her movements and the wiggling of her hips far more exaggerated than it had once been \"I hope you're ready then master! I'm going to make you pay me back a hundred times over for making me worry about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus could only gulp again as he gave the still shocked Mashu a glace and did his best to avoid looking at expansive rear of the servant pulling him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, look at it too hard at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill as he and the self-proclaimed idol boarded the lift, he couldn't help but wonder what the girl had in-store for him<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You aren't imagine anything weird right now, are you?\" the servant asked, pointing her spoon at him in an accusatory manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao let out a sniggered 'No' but the idol wasn't buying it, letting out a small 'humph' as she took another bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, regardless of whatever weirdness you're thinking up, I'll have you know that I never really liked eating bear all that much,\" the idol lectured, hand on one very wide hip \"I much preferred the sweets and fruits. Far more fitting for an idol such as myself than some big ol' bear hunted down by some burly man with an axe or some rogue with a bow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Liz's large, pale bottom eating up two seats across from him replaced the earlier image and Gudao found this one much more difficult to ignore, the indention of each, cushion sized cheek struggling to break free made the man's cheeks heat up a bit, each indentation of the chair, each wobble of softened flesh only causing his heart to beat a bit quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis earned another unhappy reaction from the lancer class servant, although she probably would've been pleased to know that the reaction this time was a tad more... generous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey..... Am I boring you?\" the horned girl asked as she took another bite of the parfait, her expression somewhere between a pout and a frown \"I figured that we'd be talking more but you just keep staring off into space.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words caused Gudao's heart to almost jump into his throat, his attention returned in an instant as her tried to cheer up the sulking, bottom heavy girl across from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Liz, I'm just a bit tired from the singularity,\" the man said in a hurry, the dopey grin gone \"it's not that I'm bored, ju-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words were cold and emotionless, Liz's eyes staring off from her master and her expression now an irritated scowl, if only to prevent it from being something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just fine!\" Liz said again, doing her best to keep her pale blue eyes off of her master \"Go back to your room and just leave me here, I-I'll be fi-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fork full of potato with a 'healthy' helping butter interrupted what had been steadily building up to be one of Elizabeth Bathory's famous tantrums, the girl's gaze returning to the beaming smile of Gudao, the man leaning over the table so that he could hand feed her a piece of his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the man said, his eyes meeting those of his servant \"you said you wanted to spend some time together so that's what we're going to do. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lancer nodded, fork still in her mouth and a blush starting to color her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Gudao withdrew the fork and speared a sizeable strawberry from he parfait, half the fruit covered in whipped cream, and offering it up to the girl across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, say 'aaaaah!',\" Gudao said with a warm smile, nearly poking the girls plump lips\"I think its about time you got a little spoiling for all the headaches I've given you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Liz's mind, fireworks went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-mph!\" was all the girl could manage before the fruit passed her lips, her master striking so quickly that she didn't even have time to utter a rebuttal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, I think its time I spoiled you a bit,\" the man said as he scooped up a sizable chunk of ice cream \"You were right to say that I've been leaving you behind a bit and I'm going to make up for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fireworks went off again and Liz opened her mouth, more than ready for whatever was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a solid thirty minutes, the servant was spoiled rotten by her master, hand fed meats, sweets, and more by the man as she simply relaxed, heart thumping and her mind racing for the entirety of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd finally gotten what she'd wanted, some attention from Gudao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was relishing every moment of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way her master gently fed her each bite to the way he gave her stomach a tentative, gentle rub whenever it looked like she was in pain, Liz loved every moment of being spoiled, even if her soft, lap filling gut was being bloated out by the amount of food making its way down there, the malleable flesh stretched tight thanks to the heavy meal put into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove all, however, the Lancer enjoyed the simple conversations she had with the black haired man, even if her mouth was full for a large chunk of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked about the movies she'd seen while she'd spent the week binging, discussing their good points, plot points, and quality, with Liz bemoaning the lack of any idols that matched her 'talents' in the musicals, or just simply talking about nothing of substance like they used to, the pair enjoying each other's company like they used to in the days when Chaldea was far more empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe they keep shoving those boobmonsters in everyone's faces as the heroines,\" Liz sighed as she savored a spoonful of thick, chocolate pudding \"I mean, don't they know that modest chests get more fan appeal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... Folks have different tastes,\" Gudao answered diplomatically, toeing the line on chest size \"I mean, both sides have their own benefits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wasn't having any of it though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! All those big sacks of fat are good for is back pain!\" the idol said in a voice that wasn't quite a shout, not an ounce of irony or self-awareness apparent \"They get in the way of everything and you can't wear anything cute with them! MINE are much better! A modest chest is a great chest! Don't you agree?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" The girl said with a sigh, one cheek puffed out in irritation a bit \"You were just sitting there and looking at the screen no matter what I did!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Sorry about that, I was just... thinking.\" the magus apologized, his mind fighting a war over whether to enjoy the soft pressure that was grinding against his hips or about whether he should ignore it while praying his lap's occupant didn't notice a certain, hard, something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it was worth it,\" the girl sighed, an extra wiggle thrown in before she leaned against the chest of her master, \"because I'll be the only thing you're gonna be thinking about!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't have it in him to tell the girl that she HAD been the one he was thinking of, instead saying 'Sure' and pressing play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Gudao, watching a movie with a women in his lap, regardless of size, was a new and not unwelcome experience for the man, one that he savored for every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subtle pressure on his chest where the lancer rested upon him was comforting and the sweet scent of the girl tickled his nose, the proximity of her pink hair making it far more noticeable than normal, although he did have to adjust where his head was lest one of Liz's horns poke him in the eye, especially now that the flesh of her well-padded rear pushed her up a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt every time she laughed, sighed, or gasped and whenever the idol wiggled he could feel it through her thick bottom, the malleable meat covering his lap like a thick, warm blanket that conformed to his lower body barring the part where her scaled tail flowed between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the added 'distractions', the magus was able to enjoy a relatively normal movie watching experience with his servant, the pair enjoying the movie to its fullest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed at the witty lines, the solid jokes, and the snarky comments between the characters, Liz's ringing out the loudest as she experienced them all for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air grew tense at the poison challenge or the fight with the master swordsman and Liz seemed near to tears when the lover in disguise nearly died, the ultimate culmination of the hero and the princess riding off into the distance nearly bringing the girl to tears of another sort, Gudao's arms now wrapped around her wide waist and hands resting atop her stuffed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wasn't new for the magus, though, was the comforting feeling of a person he trusted being near, the two companions who'd fought to save the world enjoying the presence of each other and the act of being together more than the actual watching of the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moment that felt like it could last forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it had to eventually come to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Liz said with a smile as the credits rolled, her weight now fully pressed into Gudao's chest \"You really weren't kidding when you said you'd picked out a good one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its a pretty good one\" the man smiled back as he pulled Liz in tighter \"I've probably seen it a hundred times and I'm still not tired of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lancer answered with a simple grunt of acknowledgement before snuggling deeper into her master's lap, an easy silence falling over the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe credits rolled as they sat and, eventually, ended, the DVD switching back to the menu with the servant and her master still resting on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't anything being said for nothing needed to be said, each person content to feel the warmth of the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, an interruption for the pleasing silence came with yawn from the magus, the man trying, but failing, to fight back the fatigue that was building up within him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Liz,\" the man said with a hesitant finality, his arms slipping from the girls stomach to her hips \"but I think it's time for me to hit it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao had half expected a few protests from the idol but, much to his shock, she answered him with a quiet \"That's fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the man asked as the girl in his lap struggled to her feet, two attempts needed before she actually succeeded. \"Don't you want to do anything else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light flick to his forehead was the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, Master!\" the servant said, a small smile on her lips and the normal, frantic energy in her eyes far more subdued \"But even an idol like me knows that you have to let the fan's rest between shows.... Although there is one thing left that I want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao didn't even get a chance to ask what it was that the girl wanted for it happened in less than a second, Liz screwing her eyes up and her cheek turning a brilliant pink as she placed a kiss upon his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a terribly long thing, the entire affair lasting less than half a second, but it wasn't quick enough to pass unnoticed by the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-there!\" the dragon blooded girl stammered as she stood back up, arms crossed and her face flushed with embarrassment \"I-I've got what I wanted and I hope you appreciate it! I-its not every day I do something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao gave little more than a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz.....\"</span></div></div>",

Like what?\" Liz asked, her expression one of mild confusion \"I thought you were going to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus fidgeted a little more under the girl's gaze, the man feeling as if he was naked before a crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am b-but I was wondering if you would care to -er- join me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took less than a second for a happy, and slightly mischievous, smile to be back on the girl's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh? You want to spend another night with your favorite idol, do you?\" the pink haired girl asked, her voice so smug that it positively oozed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went without saying that the black haired boy was a tad taken aback by lancer's nonchalance about sharing a bed with him, whatever worries he had evaporating beneath a wave of underwhelming disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...that's what I was kinda hoping for,\" the man tried, more confused than ever \"A-are you really OK with that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, haughty sounded laugh was the answer he received back, the pink haired girl laugh into the back of one hand while her tail happily thrashed behind the her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you been paying attention master?\" Liz asked, still laughing \"After all you've done tonight, I'd be more than thrilled to give my number one fan a little alone time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... O-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me go and grab some things first!\" the girl interrupted, one of her long pink nails pressing against Gudao's lips \"I'm going to really give you a night to remember!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the servant spun on her heel and skipped down the hall, her overly larger rump and hips shaking and wobbling with each step.....until her enthusiasm eventually ran out and left her panting in the hall, all while her confused master watched and wondered why asking the girl to do such a thing had been so easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Elizabeth Bathory, the blood countess and servant of the lancer class, tonight was the night she found herself facing what could have been the most terrifying door of her life, the pure white metal entrance to her master's room proving to be more frightening then the dragons, ghosts, skeletons, and weird tentacle things she'd faced in her adventures with Chaldea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the door itself that was terrifying, oh no, but the simple fact that beyond said door lay the girl's master, the magus undoubtedly in the middle of undressing if he wasn't already in his underwear already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image brought a blush to the girls cheeks and caused her to hug her 'toy', an overly large, stuffed cartoon dragon, to her chest even tighter than she already was, the stitches of the black beast threatening to burst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this Liz!\" the lancer mutter to herself as she continued to fidget in the hall, staring at the door like a mouse would stare at a cat waiting to pounce upon it \"You've already done it once, you can do it again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah but you were drunk then...\" A voice much like her own, but far more sinister, whispered in her ear \"And you did weight enough to crush him beneath that fat ass of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But he likes you like this!' A second voice, her own but far cheerier, replied to the first, its enthusiasm nearly boundless 'You saw the magazines! And he hasn't said anything about you look ugly or anything all night!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's because he's too polite to do that.' the first fired back, its tone nothing less than condescending 'He's just keeping it all locked up in his head where you can't hear it!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But he let you sit on his lap!' returned the second voice, its cheer unbroken 'He even hugged you during the movie! He wants you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh?' Asked the dark side of Liz's inner voice, its aggression focusing on her again 'Why would he want you? Have you actually LOOKED at yourself?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second voice didn't respond and the first merely gloated in silence as the dragon blooded girl admitted that, yes, she had seen herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving her master behind, the servant had returned to her room for a quick shower and a change into some clothes she'd picked out (See: Annoyed Da Vinci into making) for an occasion such as tonight's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a babydoll, a thin veil of black silk and dark pink ruffles that would tightly cling to her petite chest, flow down her trim figure, and flare out on her hips and rear to give them emphasis, naught but some string at the center of the dress connecting the two halves and a pair of thin straps keeping it on her shoulders, nearly all of her front bare down to a matching, black lingerie the served to keep her somewhat close to 'decent'....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that's what it had been intended to do when she was far thinner and many pounds lighter, as it stood now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin black garment wasn't fighting to keep Liz's plush body covered so much as it was being teased by a far superior opponent, every inch of the cloth at its limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThin straps cut deeply into the ample meat of the girl's shoulders and her newly 'enhanced' bust filled the cups of the silk enough to make it look like she may pop free, even if said apple-sized breasts didn't appear to be that big on their own.  From there, the lancer's globular gut hung free, its sides barely flanked by the thin, dark fabric and partially covering the matching, and fairly skimpy, garments the girl wore to keep herself covered....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front at least, Liz's backside was basically bare, the hem of the babydoll only covering a fraction of her seat cushion sized buttocks and the back of her panties sucked so far in that it only caused one to wonder how she'd managed to get them on in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a very flattering appearance and it was only thanks the the late hours of the evening and lack of people in that halls that the large girl made it to her masters room, her face red as a beet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even then, she still didn't have the will to take the final step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Liz, you've come this far!\" the girl said in an attempt to psych herself up, her entire body trembling in the hall \"Y-you can't leave a fan waiting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the cycle would begin, the lancer trying to get her confidence up only to have a few lingering doubts quell enough of them to stop her but not enough to drive her away, the poor girl locked in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he likes big chicks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you THINK he likes big girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the magazine -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-May have been someone elses, you know that Dr. Unreliable (Romani) used to hang out in here when he was skipping work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in the middle of yet another argument with herself, lancer found that her master's door had opened to reveal the man, sans much of his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young man who'd just entered adulthood, Gudao had an athletic build that was fit and trim, his muscles not extraordinarily big but toned enough to be seen. A few scars marked his pale skin and his mop of short, black hair struck up at different angles, a few bangs hanging quite close to getting into his blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's heart skipped a beat and her face found a new shade of red to turn as the girl found herself quite close, and quiet scantily clad, to her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reply was nothing more than a wordless stammer as smoke nearly began to flow from her elfin ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao, for his part, was also blushing, although he seemed far more composed than his servant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been standing there?\" the man asked, eyes briefly trailing from the girl's face down to where her breasts moved every so slightly with her trembling \"I'm so sorry, I must've missed your knock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine!\" the pink haired girl nearly shouted, her eyes wide and doing their best to avoid looking at her master's state of undress \"I-I j-just got here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother lie but one that the man bought with a sigh, his posture loosening ever so slightly and a small smile making its presence known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, perfect!\" he said, standing to the side so that his servant could step in to the darkened room, \"I was afraid I'd screwed up again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry about it!\" the girl nearly yelled again, her trembling increasing so much that her watermelon sized gut shook with the rest of her. \"I-I'd probably forgive y-you even if you did!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stood there in an awkward silence, Liz unmoving and Gudao doing his best to not look and the lancer's exposed hips, thighs, and, well, everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood was uncomfortable in the extreme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm, uh, ready if you are.\" The boy tried again, his smile sporting a tad more forced cheer \"I-I've got candles and everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's nice!\" was the only response he got out of the idol, her grip on the stuffed dragon tighter than a vice \"A-a bit of mo-mood lighting would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pregnant pause followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever hopes Gudao had had for the romantic evening were quickly dying and even his easy smile had left him, an small frown taking its place as he stared at the still shaking girl before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gudao I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair stumbled over each other before pausing again, neither willing to start until, eventually, the magus went all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, I just want you to know that you don't have to sleep with me if you don't want to.\" the black haired boy said after taking a deep breath, his mood quite dour \"I... I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to do... You can head back to your room if you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaldea's sole master waited for a response but only got Liz's mouth opening and closing a few times, a small, sad smile forming as he moved to close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Liz, sorry for doing this.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door was just about shut when a panicked shout of 'H-hold it!' and a hand shoved in the gap stopped the boy, the man, quite obviously, taken back in surprise at the sudden outburst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't walk all this way just to m-miss my own event!\" the blood countess stammered, her hand forcing the door back and her words nearly tripping over themselves \"I-I just had to prepare is all! It's not l-like I'm in a fans bed e-every night!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA titter of nervous laughter followed that statement as Liz did her best to squeeze through the gap in the door, her ponderous gut catching on the edge and her rear positively smashed against frame as she forced herself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl struggled, huffed, and tried to suck in her pudge but her figure wasn't having any of it, the dragon blooded girl stuck until her master decided to slide the door open a little more just as the lancer decided to give herself another go at squeezing through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a scene fit for a sitcom, the sudden lack of resistance combined with Liz pushing forward leading to a, fairly soft, collision, Liz's face meeting Gudao's chest and her soft stomach crashing into the man's hips as they both were sent down in a tangle of limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room spun, shocked shouts range, and a solid 'thump' marked the eventual impact, Gudao laying flat on his back and a groaning lancer laying flat on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms began ringing in the magus's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owowowowow,\" the girl groaned, still laying down on her master \"why does this always happen to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao said nothing, his mind locked up and his body frozen as he did his best to ignore the warm, fleshy blanket that now covered him, Liz's cheek rubbing against his chest as she lay there and her voluminous stomach softly stroking the rest of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....Are you Ok master?\" the girl asked, pushing herself up just enough so that she only straddling the man instead of laying upon him \"I appreciate you being a cushion but I'm pretty sure that you.... you....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz drifted off into silence as a found that her master's eyes were nearly the size of dinner plates and locked squarely upon her chest, his face flush as the lancer class servant began to notice two very important things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing one was that the air was a bit cooler on her bust than it should have been and that the soft kiss of silk was strangely absent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing two was that there was something very stiff, and very warm, pressing against the bottom of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl felt her face heat up as she very slowly, and very quietly, looked down to find that the poor, innocent babydoll had finally given up, one of the thin straps on her shoulder snapping and the cloth at her chest breaking so her small, soft breasts were exposed to the world, pert, pink nipples standing at attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the girl began to tremble as she turned ever more brilliant shades of crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao's mouth opened but it was Liz's own voice that could be heard, a long, loud 'KYAAAAAA' ringing out as she tumbled off of the boy and fell flat on her back, hands doing their best to return some semblance of decency, or at least as much decency as one can half when they're nearly naked and laying on their back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only word that could accurately describe the inside of the idol's head was chaos, her thoughts a raging maelstrom of panic that could barely be deciphered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'H-he saw them, didn't he. H-he definitely saw them. There's no way he couldn't have possibly not seen them.' the, literally, fallen idol thought to herself as she lay trembling on her back 'H-he had to have seen them, there's n-no other way to e-explain t-that.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory of that unfathomably warm sensation pressing against her stomach caused the pink haired girl to continue finding deeper shades of red to turn, her meaty, ham-hock sized thighs rubbing against each other as she squirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Liz,\" Gudao tried as he sat up, eyes locked on his servant as she began to almost roll around on the ground,  \"Liz are you OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ruined....\" came a despairing moan from the lancer glass servant, her chest covered but much of her rear unhidden. \"M-my pride as an idol is ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only word the girl's master could manage as she sat up, the the pink haired woman hugging her meaty, jiggly thighs so she could remain decent and Gudao at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pride as an idol!\" the servant repeated, a sullen air hanging around her \"W-what will everyone else think if they find out I showed off my chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer master remained confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I'm not going to tell anyone...\" Gudao said, one eyebrow cocked \"I'm not the kind of guy that would tell after something like tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's mood brightened so quickly that one could've sworn it was all an act, her eyes wide and a beaming smile on her face despite the small dew at the corners of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really master?!\" the lancer asked, thick, black scaled tail wagging like an excited puppy \"Y-you won't tell anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" the man sighed, \"who sort of guy do you think I a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of flesh silenced the master as his servant pounced him in sheer joy, his head pressed between her breasts as she hugged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh master, I KNEW there was a reason I answered your summons!\" the girl nearly cheered with unabashed glee, her fickle mood settling on an overly positive one. \"Keep that up and I may just have to take you as my boyfriend once I let the world experience my voice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tried to say something but the girls tight grip only caused it to come out as a muffled mess of words, giving the servant plenty of time to continue talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have one BIG concert for my last show where I'd sing all my greatest hits to an adoring crowd!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao again tried to say something but Liz was too far lost in her own imagination to pay attention, her grip dangerously tight on the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'd give a last bow to my crying fans and we'd head out for a nice date with me in my best clothes and you in a dashing suit! W-we'd have a nice meal, go out to a park where we'd just relax with each other and then we'd head back to our apartment f-for things..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant's master resigned himself to listening to the rest of the fantasy, hoping that he didn't run out of air before it ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you'd light some candles and turn down the light's,\" the girl said, her eyes closed as she pictured the scene \"a-and lay me down on the bed where y-you'd massage me before we....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small light flicked on in the lancer's head, her eyes snapping open and her smile frozen in place as a great truth was revealed to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearly naked Gudao. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light candles and lowered light in his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that talk about sleeping with him that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth Bathory, the blood countess and a girl who could claim to have the blood of dragon's in her veins, finally understood what was supposed to happen that night in her master's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the first time, the lancer's face was drained of all color at this realization, her smile stiffening until it looked like fragile glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Liz?\" Gudao managed, the man just barely turning his head enough to speak \"Liz, is something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, why did you invite me here tonight?\" the girl asked in a terrifyingly cheerful tone the froze the blood in Gudao's veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Gudao asked, the arms holding him now a tad more frightening than comforting. \"I-I asked you earlier if you wanted to h-have sex with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words hadn't even left the man's mouth and he already felt that he'd given the wrong answer, his servant releasing him from her grip so that the pair could sit face to face, Liz's expression still locked in that terrifying smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry master but if I remember correctly, you asked me to 'Share a bed' with you,\" the idol said in a level tone that terrified the man, the girl no longer caring about how her chest was there for all to see \"which, if I'm not mistaken, meant that you wanted to sleep with me and do nothing else... RIGHT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anger in the last word was so fierce that Gudao, couldn't help but flinch at it, the man almost feeling like it was his turn to tremble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess it could sound that way.\" the man admitted, unable to meet the closed eyed gaze of his servant \"I'm sorry if I mislead you in anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girl's blue eyes flicked open in judgement, the murderous aura that had formed dying down a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that master?\" she asked, the forced cheer in her tone a little less strong \"I'm afraid I missed that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about misleading you...\" the man apologized, his tone genuine \"I didn't mean too but if we do 'it' then I want you to be doing it because you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the greatest of apologies but it was a heartfelt one nonetheless, Gudao hoping that he'd be forgiven, or at least lessen the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz's eye closed itself again and her smile fell into a small frown as she considered the apology, some over exaggerated 'hmmmms' slipping out as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it may not have looked like it, Liz was actually quite pleased to know that Gudao thought of her in 'that way', even if her whole discovery about the thing had brought more than a little embarrassment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The-there needs to be more romance!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside her head, the silence in the room was deafening, the uncharacteristic silence of the idol only serving to worsen Gudao's feelings of guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I'll let him reflect on his actions a bit more before a-accepting,' the girl continued to ponder, the frown briefly becoming a small, mischievous smile 'a-after all, he is willing to do such things even when I look like th-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth, will you please have sex with me!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shout was sudden, loud, and earned itself a response that matched it in those departments, Liz's thick tail shooting straight like a cat as she nearly screamed in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you IDIOT what are you doing!\" the girl stammered out, her face pink again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing what I said I'd do!\" the magus responded, an odd fire blazing in his blue eyes \"No tricks! No ambiguity! I said what I wanted to say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that much!\" the girl shouted back, her hands on her knees and her body leaning towards the kneeling man \"B-but you can't just go out there and a-ask me something like that! T-there's gotta be romance! K-kissing! You gotta -!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever else that Gudao 'gotta' do before asking such a sensitive question was lost as a sudden pressure closed Liz's lips, the dragon's posture putting herself just close enough to her master for him to go for a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as kisses went, it wasn't a terribly impressive one, the technique nonexistent and the passion one would normally expect in such a situation absent, the entire thing looking more like two kids sharing their first kiss under the swing-set rather than a pare of lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the lancer, though, it far excelled what even the hungriest of kisses could accomplish, the blush extending to the tips of her pointed ears and heart thumping thunderously loud in her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne second passed, followed by another and another, the pair locked in a chaste kiss for seemingly countless seconds until the need for air caused Gudao to break it, the room deathly silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" the man asked, hands curled into nervous fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not really fair to ask a girl something like that.....\" the servant slowly said, a small, slightly embarrassed smile on her face \"I-I mean, how can I say no to something like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide grin appeared on the man's face and the pink haired idol soon found herself wrapped up in a great hug, the rosy nipples of her modest chest rubbing against Gudao's own pecs as he locked the girl in another, and far deeper, kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was one that was answered back by Liz, the girl's eyes closing as her own arms wrapped around her master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, there was passion, the small gasps slipping from the pair as they locked lips, tasting the other like a thirsty man who'd just found water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hearts synced, their bodies melded together, and the embrace grew tight, the soft chest of the lancer nearly smashed flat and her soft, flabby stomach pushed out whatever gaps it found. Thoughts were fogged by want and soon enough Gudao's hands began to wander, one hand moving up to hold the back of the idol's head, fingers softly digging through silken, pink locks, while the other slid low to experience the monstrosity that was Liz's rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge enough to completely smother whomever ended up beneath them, the lancer's soft buttocks were large orbs of pal skin that flowed into equally thick thighs, the meager muscles hidden behind thick layers of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's hand couldn't even begin to cover even a third of one cheek, forcing the boy to simply caress the supple flesh or give it an exploratory push, his hand sinking deeply into the pliable meat, not even a fierce squeeze was enough to draw more than a surprised squeak form the idol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her master's hands explored her wide rump, Liz's own hands were simply resting on the man, each limb crossing the man's back and holding him in, the girl's increasingly lust fogged mind struggling to come to terms with the new heat that burned within her, the speed of her thrashing tail only increasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao's hand slipped to the curve of one of the lancer's door jammingly big hips as his partner in the kiss began to squeeze her thighs together, a strange wetness making its presence known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a sudden gasp that the kiss finally broke, the master and servant's breathing heated and their bodies flushed as they prepared for what was going to come, eye's locked and lips but a hair away from beginning another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz, are you sure you want to do this?\" Gudao asked, the man barely able to keep his instincts in check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause before the girl finally spoke, the blood countess struggling to get her thoughts in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-to be honest, no... I-I've never really been good at this kind of stuff,\" the servant admitted, her smile a tad and a weak laugh coming out \"B-but as long as you're gentle, it'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Gudao needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his servant's hand, the magus helped Liz stand before the pair shed their final pieces of clothing, the man discarding his briefs with haste while Liz shed her ruined babydoll, the top falling to the floor in a heap and lingerie joining it a few moments later after working it down her thick legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that last piece of cloth hit the ground, each person looked at their partner, drinking in the sight of their body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither was disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Liz, she was able to fully see her master's athletic frame, his muscles noticeable without being overly large and his fair skin marked by the occasional small scar or blemish, blue eyes taking it all in until they finally locked upon Gudao's manhood, the girl fighting to not look at the too much, and losing quite handily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus did not notice how much his member was being stared at for he was too busy enjoying Liz's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been a girl who cared deeply about her figure, LIz's skin was positively flawless, creamy skin absent of any scars or bruises despite her numerous battles and nary a mole in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer apple sized breasts stood rested perkily upon her chest with only the barest hint of sagging and her large, flowing stomach was bare for all to see, the watermelon sized orb of flesh free from stretchmarks and the barest hint of a belly fold making itself known, the lower 'lip' of her gut hiding her womanhood from view. Wide hips fit for the mother of a dozen children wiggled from side to side as the girl kept herself ready and each little movement caused the thick flesh of her thighs and overly large bottom to wobble and shake, tail barely visible behind the them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment more they looked upon each other, psyching themselves up for what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Liz's hand, Gudao slowly led the girl to his bed, settling her down upon her back as gently as he could, doing his best to ease whatever nervousness she still had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed creaked under the weight of the extra soft girl, her legs bowed slightly and her tail tucked between them to keep her secret spot hidden, modest chest rising and falling with each heated breath while her shockingly pink hair splayed out on the bed beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, carefully, Gudao moved onto the bed to position himself, slowly pulling away the thick, black scaled appendage to finally reveal the lightly glistening opening that lay beneath, Liz's small opening shaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight gave the man pause, his first, real sight of the thing giving him pause as the weight of the situation bore down upon him, much to the servant's embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-geez, d-don't just stare!\" the girl stammered, deeply embarrassed at such a spot being ogled \"J-just get to it and remember to be gentle....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" the man said one final time, positioning himself before his partner's womanhood in a way that left her meaty thighs clutched his sides \"Here goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz shook gently as her lips were parted, the cool air briefly kissing her there before a thick, burning heat filled her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, surprisingly, a lack of pain, although Gudao did feel that Liz's tunnel was clutching him tightly, the girl still nervous about the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant it was time for her master to help her, the man drawing a yelp from the girl as he leaned forward upon her, his hips pushing her legs back as he moved to lay upon the girl his hands entwined with hers as he started what he'd heard referred to as a 'mating press'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you have to be so close?\" the idol stuttered, her nose less than an inch from his \"B-because this is kind of embarrassing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus merely smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing those last few millimeters, Gudao began the lovemaking with another kiss, this one slow and sensual as he began to gently plunge into the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlick walls gripped his member as it went ever deeper into the girl and a muffled moan of pleasure tinted with surprise slipped from the lancer, her mouth being plundered by that of her master's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft belly fat squeezed against the flat stomach of the master and soft nipples trailed against his skin as he slowly moved as far as he could, his tip touching something within the shorter girl that informed him how he could go no further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the man's hips moved backwards, the tight, slick tunnel that once fought to slow his progress now hungrily fighting to keep him in, every inch of his sensitive shaft stroked and squeezed by the pink walls. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pace was slow, tender, and purposeful, each thrust easing the fears of the girl so that she loosened up bit by bit, their hands locked and tongues dancing until the pace could increase, a small moan or squeak of joy emanating from Liz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn and out, advancing and retreating, Gudao filled Liz with a head while she guided him within, her timidity slowly fading until the passion of their lips ceased to be a one-sided battle, the pink haired idol giving as good as she got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHushed, hungry moans filled the air alongside the nearly silent sound of skin rubbing against skin, the idol's pudgy gut slick from exertions and rubbing against the far more solid center of her master, small jiggles coursing through it to mark each impact while her thighs did the same, toes curling as the meeting of their secret places caused a similar sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Liz, it was a toe curling sensation, the gentle impacts and presence of the burning rod within her causing the idol to experience a more fulfilling fullness than an meal she'd partaken in, no matter the size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure shocked her nerves and her heart beat fast with feelings once kept hidden, only the seal of the pairs lips keeping them from being uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Gudao, the feeling was different but got the same response, the walls kissing him in a manner that was softer than silk, hungrily inviting him into their depths and caressing him in a way the sent pleasurable shivers up his spine, a pressure building up within the man as the night continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the pair, Liz was the one who reached bliss first, her body giving a small shudder and her eyes briefly opening as her nerves danced with esctasy, a small spasming of her walls informing Gudao that he'd brought her to the peak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also signalling that he could go harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow, tender pace increased with the man's confidence as his pounding became a rhythmic slapping of flesh meeting flesh, the need for air forcing the kiss to end so that he could suck in more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft kiss of his partner's thighs around his wast soon build in strength as Liz pressed them against the magus, her body hungry to feel more of the man against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-too much,\" the smaller woman gasped as the frantic pace began to overload her, tail tangling itself in the sheets behind her as it flailed about on its own \"c-can't think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer master only took the comment as a sign to keep going, the man loving the sight of soft, bouncing breasts an wobbling meat that his every push caused, a squeak of joy muffled behind a bit lip marking that Liz had again hit her limit, although she wasn't going to be alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the lancer's love tunnel, Gudao's member twitched as its sensitive shaft suffered under the pleasurable assault, each movement a warning of what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Liz,\" the man panted as he felt a welling dam within him threatening to break, \"I-I think I'm gonna cum.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls around the boy began to quake and spasm once more as Liz neared another peak, the duo's body's syncing up as the passionate dance drew to a close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's fine,\" the girl slurred in her love drunk state, her eyes meeting those of her love \"j-just let it out master, just let it out!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time came, the dam broke, and Liz's secret place clamped down upon her master's rod as a sea of white broke loose, the primal instincts of the servant causing her meaty legs to wrap around the man's lower back to hold him in while she milked him for all his worth, an agonizingly loud scream of ecstasy ripping from the dragon blooded girls throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick spurt, a twitch, and a shudder marked the closing of the carnal play, the slapping of flesh on flesh and frantic gasping soon replaced by tired pants as all strength abandoned the pair, Gudao, gently, falling in bed next to Elizabeth Bathory, his servant and lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite some time for the pair to catch their breaths and the brilliant afterglow of the act they'd engaged them silenced them for more than a few minutes, the sheets turned into a rumpled, mess and their bodies intertwined as they enjoyed the comforting warmth of each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ticking of the clock filled the otherwise silent room and the last, dying wisps of smoke from the candles welcomed the encroaching darkness around the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words were said for none were needed, the magus relaxing on his back while the pink haired lancer nestled beside him, her head laying upon his arm and her soft stomach pressing against him, a small, but no less warm, smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slow gentleness, Gudao put out the last burning candle that lay upon his bed-stand, his partner managing to pull up the blankets with the last of her strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Liz.\" the magus said with a tired smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night master,\" the girl yawned, her blue eyes closing as she nuzzled against him \"I love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Liz.\"<br>\r\n.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For Elizabeth Bathory, the now significantly heavier servant, morning came in a wave of comforting warmth, the soft girl greeting the breaking of dawn with a less than enthusiastic moan before snuggling deeper into the covers... Something that wasn't all that easy to accomplish considering her plush figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as Chalea hadn't planned on hosting servants or people of Liz's 'magnitude', they'd filled each of the rooms for masters and servants with a solitary, twin sized bed, a grossly inadequate piece of furniture considering that the lancer herself could take up seventy percent of its width simply by sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick, black scaled tail hung over the side of the bed and the idol's great bottom was only partially covered by the sheets, a full two thirds of it left bare as the cloth hung pathetically off of her extra wide hips. One pink nailed foot and part of her chunky calf lay without anything to cover it while the upper part of her softer back had only the tangled locks of her hot pink hair to cover it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse than the lack of proper blankets, or perhaps even better depending on how one looked at it, was the limited space that the bed offered, the two occupants of the bed pressed tightly against each other in the hopes of remaining somewhat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao was laying flat upon his back while Liz had adopted a sleeping position on her side, the man's arm draped over his servant's body while she pressed against him, her stomach overflowing where it pressed against his stomach and one of her own hands resting on her master's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the duo had taken the position naturally, it was one they probably would've had to take regardless of their feelings as each was but a roll way from exiting the bed in a forceful manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Liz wouldn't have changed even the most minor of discomforts if it meant she lost anything of the prior evening, a slow blush building as she recalled the sound of flesh on flesh and the fullness she'd longed for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed along with the ticking of the clock until, with a deep inhale and a sleepy groan, Gudao too joined his servant in the land of the waking, the arm he had draped over his servant pulling her tight as he woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Master.\" Liz greeted in a cheerful, but slightly quiet, voice, answering the slight hug with one of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Liz,\" the master greeted back, hiding a yawn as he did so, \"you sleep well last night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl made a small, happy noise and was rewarded with a ruffling of her hair, Gudao laying back in the bed to enjoy a few more moments of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words were said and the duo simply cuddled each other in the early morning 'light', the closed off rooms lights set purposefully dim so that their mornings didn't start with harsh, artificial bulbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little the shackles of slumber were thrown off and small, innocuous conversation occurred between the pair, much of it centering about what they were planning to do during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a small breakfast together and and one of those 'video games' I've heard so much about?\" Liz suggested, lazily dragging her nail along the man's chest \"Scarface and that drunk assassin seemed to enjoy them while we waited.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" the magus mused, giving a little shrug \"I'll need to see if Da Vinci and the rest want me for a minor rayshift or want to talk more about what happened last time, we can do breakfast at least and maybe do something else later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz let out a small, annoyed groan and pouted on the man's chest, one cheek puffing out as she lay there, earning her head another pat as her master rose from the bed and gave the girl another look at his naked form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that'll have to do,\" the girl said with a blush, trying too hard not to stare at the man's naked body \"S-so, I guess I'll see you in the cafeteria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus gave the girl a confused look, the day's clothes hanging over his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? We can go there together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the thought master but I need to get some more clothes than a busted top for that.\" the girl said, waving the man off a bit as she finally rose from the bed to gather the scattered articles of clothing \"Besides, I appreciate the thought but I don't think we'd both fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGudao's cheeks brightened a bit as he gave an unconscious look towards the bathroom attached to his room, no doubt imaging the small, glass standing shower that lay within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodbyes were exchange, a kiss was given (Liz having to stand on her tip toes to reach her master's cheek), and the servant left her master's room wrapped up in her master's bed sheet, the remains of her babydoll hanging on one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for the most harrowing of challenges, making it back to her room unseen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As could be expected of someone who proudly referred to them-self as  \"Chaldea's Number One Idol\", Liz was someone well versed in the ways of stealth, her 'hobby' more inclined to drawing attention than avoiding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she was a lancer, not some weak little assassin class servant that hid in the shadows and waited for their moment to stab someone in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that's what she used to believe at least, right now the plump girl was dearly wishing that she had some sort of invisibility as the too towel she was wearing wasn't exactly cutting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically speaking, the length of white cloth was covering all the 'important' parts of her body, the lower hem of the towel falling only to mid thigh and the top hanging just high enough to cover her nipples, although the top half of her areola could still be seen along with a thin strip of flesh running down her left side and thigh where the towel's edges failed to touch....Not to mention how the fabric failed to cover even half of her tremendous, wobbling bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow large enough to keep the spots within hidden, the size of the idol's own assets was keeping her 'back door' hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just keep moving Liz, just a few more hallways!' the girl thought to herself, cheeks pink and doing the best to ignore the sensation of her soft thighs rubbing against each other 'No one's going to be up at this time! Just keep moving, just keep moving!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 'move' she did, each step of the larger 'lizard's' gait causing her more than shoulder width hips to sway in a way that more resembled a strut than a walk, the slower pace less to do with her weight and more to do with that shelf of a backside she now sported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'H-he may like it but this may take some getting used too,' the girl sighed to herself, blue eyes briefly dipping down the modest chest she now sported 'at-least something good came from this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, the lancer had never been particularly ashamed of her formerly flat chest, or anything about herself for that matter, but she was more than happy to have a small boost to her bust, although she still couldn't fathom how OK she was with what had come with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is what they say about people doing crazy things for love,\" the lancer mumbled, shaking her head at the insanity of the whole situation \"although I really didn't figure master was this kinda guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lancer rounded another corner, clothes still draped over her one free arm and tail still sticking out like a counterweight, pale cloth draped over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few more steps and she'd be in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Liz, those last few steps were far too late to avoid detection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft flesh met soft flesh and twin shouts of shock filled the hallway as Liz collided with another figure, the lancer just barely keeping herself from falling to the floor while the other figure failed to do so, tumbling to the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch where you're going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu! Don't you know when to make way for your empress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever anger the lancer felt at the sudden impact cooled in an instant as she realized who she'd just run into, her heart sinking as she found herself looking at familiar golden locks, bright green eyes, and a chest that a man could be smothered in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the floor and pouting quite fiercely, the saber class servant was wearing her familiar red dress, although the article of clothing wasn't quiet handling her improved 'figure' all that well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest of her dress was strained to its maximum limit, chest-flesh positively overflowing to such a degree that more of her breasts were out of the cloth than in it. The middle of the dress wasn't faring much better either, the red and white cloth stretched out and the 'corset' portion removed so that her soft flesh wasn't constricted by any of the bindings, the hole in her backless shirt showing off a bit of back flab and the deep crevasse that was the upper part of her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the saber's face? A puffy cheeked pout that soon turned into a sunny smile as soon as she realized who she was looking at, the complete opposite of what Liz's expression was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Liz! I was not expecting to see you up so early, although this is a welcome encounter!\" the green eyed empress nearly shouted, rising to her feet with such force that her chest bounced \"Although I'm loathe to admit it, your empress requires your assistance today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" Liz said, her tone less than enthusiastic \"but I really have t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero ignored the lancer, the girl continuing to speak regardless of what her rival said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was unable to locate our Praetor last evening in the medical bay, a good thing I may add, and soon found myself held there by ne're-do-wells seeking to keep me from him!\" the empress blabbed, her voice sorrowful and words seemingly unending \"The poked and prodded my grand form all evening, which was appreciated but unhelpful, keeping me from him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sucks.\" the idol tried again, her retort sharp as she attempted to scoot a few more feet down the hall \"But I really gotta g-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saber's arm launched out and grabbed the Blood Countess by the shoulder, pulling the towel clad girl in until they were side to side, although Nero's overly large chest was brushing against her friend's own meager bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'll need someone with ears and eyes almost as good as mine to find him today!\" Nero continued, heedless of Liz's struggling to break free \"Today you will help me.... help me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of surprise appeared on the empress's face as she finally took in the state of her friend's dress, or lack thereof to be more specific, the saber's green eyes going wide as she looked at the much softer, and far less decent looking, lancer for what seemed like the very first time.  </span></div></div>",

Honestly Elizabeth, if you wanted to dress in the ways of the Romans, I could've lent you one of my togas!\" the saber said, although it was directed more at herself than to the lancer \"And why is your hair so messy? You aren't giving up on our rivalry already just because of a few pounds are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you ever heard about glass houses?\" the idol sighed, groping a handful of Nero's potbelly \"You really aren't the one who should be talking about these kinds of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress didn't even dignify the groping with a notice, the girl merely puffing up her substantial chest in pride before she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu! My figure is the figure of Rome, it will always be perfect! Besides, 'I' am not the one who is walking about Chaldea in naught but their towel and under....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway fell deathly quiet as Nero noticed that clothes the lancer was carrying didn't just include evening wear, a pair of black, lacy garments standing out amongst them like a sore, pink thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lancer blushed but remained silent, the saber's jaw dropping and eyes going wide as she worked out the mental math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.... You did it didn't you?\" the empress asked, the woman slowly rounding on Liz \"That's why I couldn't find you and Praetor last evening! You were sharing a be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of it?\" The tubby idol said with a small snarl, tail thrashing angrily as she pulled away \"I-I love him and he l-loves me! If you don't like it than you can just g-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happy squeal robbed the lancer of whatever anger she had as two head sized orbs pressed against her, the soft breast flesh almost touching Liz's chin thanks to the force of the hug while Nero spun and twirled the both of them in the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's wrong with you?!\" the lancer shouted as her saber friend continued to laugh and smile like a madwoman, the sight causing a staff member who'd happened upon the sight to immediately turn around and head back the way he'd came. \"Are you insane?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" was the cheered response as the spinning slowly came to a stop, the overly busty woman gripping her flatter compatriot by the shoulders as she spoke \"For only an unparalleled genius such as myself could enact a plan such such as this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion only continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell kind of plan are you going on about?\" the lancer shouted, a silent 'And what's it got to do with me and master sharing a bed?' added for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress merely smiled smugly, her eyes gleaming with delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fool proof plan to keep you around once our and I become Praetor and Emperor!\" the girl boldly declared, the overly loud tone ringing throughout the halls \"I would've been most displeased to have my most worthy rival vanish once the ceremony was complete!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz.... Liz had no real response to such an insane statement, her mouth open and one eye twitching slightly in an attempt to comprehend the madness that was the red saber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu! It's appropriate for you to be in awe of my intellect's staggering magnitude!\" Nero gloated, completely misunderstanding what her friend was thinking \"If you are in love with Praetor then you cannot help but stay once we're together!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...but...What makes you think he'd marry you and not me?\" Liz said with a sigh, already feeling the beginnings of a headache \"And besides, shouldn't it be emperor and empress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Praetor be an empress?\" Nero asked, head cocking to the side a bit \"He's a boy! Boy's can't be empresses! Besides, I'm already emperor, you can't have two of those.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever twisted logic existed in that statement, it made Liz's head hurt a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But in regards to your first question, you can simply be his concubine!\" the empress continued, her smile utterly innocent despite what she was saying \"That way he can marry me and we can still have you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I'll be a concubine!\" Liz fired back, more than a little angry \"If anything, you can be the concubine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can work on the titles later.\" Nero said with a smile, waving one hand nonchalantly \"I was never all that fond of Rome's marriage laws anyways, far too restrictive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not being a concubine.\" Liz repeated, crossing her arms on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also not hearing a no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement was sharp, simple, and knocked Liz on her proverbial back-foot, Liz's fire dying out a little bit while Nero gave a smug smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- J-..Fine, \" the pink haired woman conceded, a small smile forming \"I'm not ENTIRELY opposed to the idea of forming a small group with you, it's quite rare for folks to truly appreciate my singing like you and master do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu! And I do not often find someone who rivals me in the arts!\" the blond girl answered back, eyes still sparkling \"A joining of our talents would put the world in awe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands were extended and a handshake made, the odd pair coming to an odder conclusion in the halls of Chaldea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of Elizabeth Bathory's room was, unsurprisingly, girly, the walls a soft pink along with the blankets on the idols bed. Overstuffed, heart shaped pillows rested at the head of the bed along with a veritable medley of stuffed animals, the half open closet in the room showing off entire racks of cute clothes that would need to be refitted soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit more cute than Nero's room but not lacking when it came to the ego stroking, the walls covered in self made posters of Liz while framed pictures of her in cute poses covered the drawers, although more than a few had Gudao in the same shot with Liz, the man more often than not looking as if he'd just been ambushed by the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Elizabeth's little piece of paradise inside of the magus organization, a quiet place she could relax in after a hard day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this morning it had a new arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you able to get so many pictures of yourself with Praetor?\" Nero asked as she flipped through a small album on the bed, the saber absentmindedly swinging her legs in the air as she lay on her overly large chest \"He never seems willing to stay with me to get one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you keep trying to him in a painting.\" the lancer said, toweling off her mid-back reaching hair \"No one sits for those now-a-day, just get a picture taken by one of those cameras.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing their mutual understanding, the servants had returned to lancer's room so she could shower and prepare for the day, ahead..... Although the saber class servant had to stay behind while her friend freshened up, much to the former's displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer but I don't think both of us will fit,\" the pink haired girl had said, shooing away an eager looking Nero \"not all of us were able to get that pool you call a bath.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empress had been displeased but relented, allowing Liz to go into the shower and rediscover her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the standing shower and with warm water cascading down her, the Blood Countess took a moment to explore her figure, feeling and squeezing the growing bits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with her apple sized breasts, Liz had gently pinched and jiggled the soft flesh, marveling in the foreign movements and noting that the new meat seemed far more sensitive than she remember. Small squeezes drew excited breaths and the slow shakes caused her rosy buds to rise, begging to be pinched by someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl managed to stop herself before she began doing something other than washing and instead turned her attention towards her gut, the soft, doughy orb now the size of an overstuffed pillow, last nights spoiling, Liz noticed, adding a bit more meat to the paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer firm, the lancer's stomach now hung low enough to keep her sex hidden, her belly button now a bit more cavernous and each movement causing little shakes and ripples throughout the orb of fat, small droplets of water flying from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like with her chest, the servant gave her gut an experimental shake, the quivering belly sending odd little jolts of pleasure through the rest of the servant and the heat on her cheeks now from more than just the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing in a more southerly direction, Liz began to fully feel her biggest asset, her wide hips and meaty rear far larger than anything that could be considered normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide enough to take up two spots on the couch and thick enough to raise the girl up when she sat, the idol's lower body was a trophy earned for her gluttony, the sheer scope of her underwear devouring seat making even the simple act of maneuvering in the shower difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesigned for people of more normal proportions, Chalea's showers were standing, glass cubes that were just big enough for a single person to stand and move in, although their arms would need to be kept tight lest they start slamming their arms and wrists against the glass 'coffin.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Liz it simply meant that her overly large rear and hips were squashed in on all sides, the pliable flesh pressing against the back and sides of the shower so hard that each movement brought a sharp squeak, the sound causing the red tint of embarrassment to reach the pointed tips of Liz's ears. </span></div></div>",

Although it is a difficult thing for us to do, we will need to deny the masses our lovely voices,\" the blonde hair girl continued for her lancer class friend, a few crumbs of heavily jam covered toast besmirching her cheeks while her positively massive bust touched the master's elbow \"but we feel that it'll be a welcome change of pace compared to our usual, mass performances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magus simply continued to nod, a slightly dopey smile on his face as he enjoyed the moment and ignored the future, although another occupant of the table was less than enthusiastic at the idea of Gudao being left alone with the two servants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that person's name, was Mashu Kyrielight, more commonly called Shielder when out on a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been the magus's very first servant, and he her 'senpai' (a term Liz had come to understand as meaning a 'teacher or superior of sort), Mashu had become understandably attached to the young man, something that occasionally displayed itself as a slight possessive streak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who else will be joining Senpai at this performance?' the lilac haired girl asked in a cool tone, the one eye not hidden behind her bangs giving the lancer and saber a stern stare through her glasses \"Surely it isn't going to be just the three of you is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward pause from the pink haired idol and her green eyed partner in crime made it all too obvious that, yes, it was going to be just the three of them, although Gudao didn't waste the opportunity to offer his 'kohai', a word that Liz had later learned to mean 'junior', an invitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls wouldn't mind an extra member in the audiance, would you?\" the black haired magus asked, his cheerful gaze swiftly going to the girls at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" Liz said with a bit of hesitation, arms crossed over her soft chest, \"I-if you want than I guess ONE more member wouldn't hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roman emperor, in comparison, was far less hesitant, the overly busty woman's hands going to her hips as she puffed up her chest, head-sized breasts straining against her white cloth as the girl gave her own 'imperial proclamation.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would find no objections from me! Mashu would be a fine addition to the group!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saber class servant and her master both smiled, the former letting out a rather haughty laugh, while bespectacled girl and dragon blooded idol both let out a sigh, although probably not for the same reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you master but is now really the time for such things?\" the purple eyed girl asked, her mood now turning curious, \"I really think that an investigation would be more prudent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An investigation?\" the master asked in confusion, quickly swallowing the remains of the bacon strip he'd been chewing \"An investigation into what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn stark comparison to the rather confident manner in which she'd discussed the concert, Mashu's attitude became rather meek, the girl squirming at being put on the spot as three sets of eyes turned on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it should be rather obvious,senpai.\" the shielder class servant said, her eyes briefly going to Nero and Elizabeth before falling down to the table. \"I hate to do this but...uh....It involves Ms. Elizabeth and Ms. Nero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I haven't done anything!\" the lancer class servant protested through another mouthful of waffle, \"And don't call me 'Ms. Elizabeth' it makes me feel old!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, neither I nor my rival have done anything to warrant such a thing!\" the empress followed up, her retort accompanied by a pout \"Well... I cannot say that Elizabeth hasn't done something of interest lately but I most certainly have not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon tailed girl gave her red-clad companion a glare that said, in no uncertain terms 'don't say a thing about me and master' but it was largely ignored as the short haired girl spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me but I may have been a little unclear.\" Mashu said, doing a little bow at the table \"What I meant to say was that it involves your...uh....figures.. a-along with the figures of some others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally shy girl's face took on the reddish tint of a blush while the other three at the table took a quick look about the room, noting that Liz and Nero weren't the only women with softer forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most obvious examples were Jing Ke and Drake, the pair's large beer guts hanging free from their clothes and busts wobbling with each hearty chuckle, and the lovely French Princess Marie, was daintily poking at a mountain of food with her normal gang of Motzart, Sanson, and Chevalier, the last of which was showing a small, poochy belly in the place of her normally flat stomach, but they were far from the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple employees of Chaldea were showing softer features, larger rears, thicker thighs, and burgeoning bellies, the uniforms straining to keep their owners decent as buttons on their chests threatened to pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis even carried over to yet more servants, although none had as drastic a change as Marie, Liz, Nero, Jing Ke, and Drake, the table of Artorias now showing dresses that were starting to hug rather pronounced guts and the two lancers threatening to pop their already rather tight tops at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair.... I've only been back for about a day now,\" Gudao replied, his gaze lingering on the rider class servant Boudica's rear for a quite a few seconds, the magus hoping that the ample cushioning and wider hips would snap the skirt at any moment. \"Although I have been rather curious about the...er...changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks like its only effecting the girls....\" Liz noted, pouting slightly and nudging Gudao's hip with her own, extra large rump when she notice his stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why your chest's bigger!\" Nero exclaimed rather suddenly, pointing at Mashu after suddenly rising \"I thought I was imagining things!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush on Mashu's face deepened to such a degree that one could've mistaken her for a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-be that as it may,\" the girl stammered, unwilling to look up \"I-I still think that we should look into why this is happening, its strange enough that its happening to the employees but for it to h-happen to servants is something that should be impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief silence fell over the table as each member thought over the implications of such a thing happening, the thought turned over and over till Liz spoke.....and utterly destroyed the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that we should just wait till Da Vinci or one of that casters comes up with something,\" the self-proclaimed idol said in a flippant tone, turning so that she could face her master \"and until that happens, I think that Gudao should be a proper gentlemen and spoil me a little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to tell if it was Nero, Mashu, or Gudao himself that said the word first but, regardless, the trio said it at nearly the same time, a happily smiling Liz taking the man's hand and spearing a huge slab of pancake on the fork before opening her mouth with a little 'aaaaaahhh'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Elizabeth! What are yo-\" was all poor Mashu could get out before she was rudely interrupted by Nero, the saber class servant shouting \"But you got him last night! I should be first this time!\" before leaning in with her own mouth open, her new position lodging her master bicep squarely between her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndecision struck the man as she saw two waiting girls, his eyes turning towards Mashu for support only to find that the girl was, rather timidly, looking at him with hopeful eyes, rather hypocritically expecting a bite despite her earlier talk about investigations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was faced with the ultimate nightmare, three fine choices but only one good answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a gulp....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gudao was in a tight spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, he was getting quite close to Liz, the girl's wide hips currently wiggling in a loudly creaking eat, and wanted to continue spoiling that idol of his, even if said 'idol' was starting to weigh more than most idol groups. Conversely, NOT feeding the pink haired girl was practically an invitation for hours of angry pouting and complaints, something the master never looked forward to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, spoiling the lizard would, obviously, displease the roman saber before him, the girls green eyes currently sparkling with anticipation and her chest put forward to show off the more than ample cleavage she now sported. To dash those hopes and watch the excitement drain for those emeralds would wound Gudao far more than he would ever want, along with invite a tantrum that would rival Liz's in scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, last but not least, there was Mashu, the bespectacled, lilac haired girl fidgeting nervously in her seat while her mouth alternated between being pressed shut in anxiety and half open in expectation, soft lips parted in welcome for the syrupy sweetness that came with those pancakes. Her displeasure would be far less vocal than the other girls but just potent, pouts, sharp words, and cold shoulders turned in her master's direction for such a snub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasing one girl meant displeasing two, something that their master deeply, deeply dreaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an impossible choice..... Or at least it seemed like one until the magus realized that there was always a fourth option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he gladly took, following a small gulp to steady his nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash, the syrup soaked piece of pancake was thrust into the waiting mouth of the lancer, the little 'aaaaah' turning into a series of nearly orgasmic sounding moans, an overly elaborate exaggeration that drew some curious gazes from the others in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, Gudao hoped they were exaggerated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there wasn't time to focus on what was or wasn't an act, Nero was already starting to pout and Mashu's shoulders were starting to slump in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift turn of the wrist, the black haired magus sliced another generous piece of pancake from his stack, thick droplets of syrup staining the plate before he swiftly inserted the piece past the busty saber's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn but an instant the girl's frown turned itself around into a satisfied, self-assured smirk, a cheerful glow once more surrounding the woman as Gudao cut yet another chunk and offered it to the waiting, but slightly confused, kohai of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other two, the purple eye'd girl offered up a bit of resistance to accepting the bite, the eye not covered by her lilac bangs alternating between Liz, Nero, and her master in quick order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want a bite?\" the girl's master asked, inching the culinary delight closer, \"It's good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls lips remained shut, although Liz and Nero's certainly didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Eggplant! Live a little!\" the dragon-blooded baroness urged with a warm smile, although her eyes were locked on the pancake piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! A little relaxation and pampering is good for the soul!\" Nero added, her chest pushing forward a bit and, unseen to the rest, fingers intertwining with Gudao's \"Surely you don't want to dismiss Praetor's urge to satisfy us all?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMashu looked like she was going to say something but the mere opening of her lips was all Chaldea's magus needed to stop the demi-servant with a mouth full of hotcake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet taste and fluffy texture surprised the girl, along with the rather rapid insertion, but what was going to be an argument soon became a bashful acceptance, a small blush tinting her cheeks as she chewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, a small pattern emerged where the girls would each be fed a chunk of pancake, as 'bite' didn't really do their size justice, or a strip of bacon as fast as their master could manage, the man sneaking in small bites for himself or running off to get more plates as a slow conversation began to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So -munch- what were you saying earlier about our figures and investigating?\" the pink haired idol eventually asked Mashu, one cheek puffed out from the pancake packed in there \"I mean, it's weird but I've come to terms with that, it gives me a new field of idol-hood to explore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it stopped being 'weird' quite a few pounds ago.\" Mashu replied, swallowing her food and patting the small food baby she was starting to show through her black Chaldea uniform. \"Heroic Spirits aren't supposed to gain any weight at all, let alone the amount yo- some have put on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero and Liz quirked a brow in unison, the former's greatly expanded chest once more covering the bicep of her master's free arm completely and belly pressing against the tables edge while the latter's large hips and shelf-like overflowed the sides of her seat, squishing against Gudao despite the ample space that would, on a normal day, be between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMashu let out a sigh, accepting another bite a of the jelly slathered toast her master had gotten, and continued her task of getting through to the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A regular human wouldn't be able to put on the amount of weight some of the servant's gained in a year, let alone the time its taken.\" The girl said while the lancer and saber enjoyed their own bit of spoiling. \"On top of this, it seems to only be affecting the women of Chaldea regardless of their status as human or servant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Nero exchanged a glance but simply shrugged as Mashu took her own turn, the duo seemingly uncaring about the proclamation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I find this all to be a welcome change of pace!\" the golden haired empress declared, her voice taking on the tone of someone making a royal proclamation. \"It's been too long since I could <br>\r\nfeast to my heart's delight and relax in splendor of all our hard work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horned baroness couldn't help herself from muttering \"More like your stomach's delight.\" but, if she heard it, Nero paid it no mind, her grip on Gudao growing tighter as she kicked into one of her (self-proclaimed) inspirational speeches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu! In fact, this whole event is a blessing! One that allows us to truly enjoy ourselves without worrying about such trivial things as 'weight' and 'shape'! It allows us to enjoy our favorite things while also enhancing our attributes so that they are better able to be enjoyed by all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speech ended with a strong note of finality, one that would brook no further discussion on the matter as Nero turned once more to Gudao with a smug, and expectant smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what he must do, Gudao gave the red clad emperor a little ego stroking  while Liz voiced her opinion on the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda in agreement with Empress over there, although I don't think I'd necessarily call this a blessing.\" The idol said, bumping her hip against Gudao in a hope of getting some attention as well. \"I mean, I didn't like it all that much at first but I've come to terms with it. I mean, it's not like its really had any effect other than upping my charm points.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe use of 'charm point' to describe Liz's door jamming hips, the cushion sized cheeks of her rear, or her over-stuffed pillow of a gut, was probably grossly inappropriate but the girl stood by her own affirmation as Mashu frowned in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it IS having an affect on us!\" Mashu said in a tone so stern the she nearly shouted, her bust bouncing a bit more than it should have from the action. \"I-I mean, how can you expect to fight when you weigh all that much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz let out a dismissive snort as she received some attention of her own from Gudao in the form of some pats on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a servant, I can always fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMashu seemed less than certain, asking the idol \"Are you willing to put that to the test?\" </span></div></div>",

Not that the issue was solved one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt, a white t-shirt with purple, horizontal (of course), stripes, was built for a girl many sizes smaller than the one it currently was being used by, the fabric threatening to shred itself at an moment. Thick, soft arm fat oozed through the tight arm holes of the cloth, the bottom of the openings having torn so that some semblance of movement could be maintained and the hem was stuck just above the belly button of the servant's pillow sized gut, flawless, it's flawless, pale skin kissed by the cool air and jiggling with every movement.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Liz's apple sized breasts were amply covered by the stretched top, the neckline showing hints of cleavage, although they were far more covered than the lancer's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to her shirt, the bicycle shorts that the countess had once chosen to cover her rear were losing handily, her wide hips, thick thighs, and positively tremendous rear just barely kept 'decent', although that term would be used loosely at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black, stretchy fabric came up to just below her wide waist, the elasticity of the cloth stretched to the point of snapping around hips that could, and sometimes did, jam doors. This allowed a healthy chunk of the flesh of Liz's rear to also be visible, the top of her big, wobbling bottom proving to anyone that looked that she was, A) not trying to smuggle watermelons in her pants and B) that she was going commando for now, although the fatty, fish-like, black scaled tail she had could be used to cover the 'crack'. The solid appendage was already poking out from beneath her stretched tight shirt and above her spats to maintain some sort of decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the tears in the spats alongside her thick, ham-hock like thighs, along with some splits along the rear, already showed that there was nothing beneath but her bottom coverings but silken skin, the meat above her knees shoved into the pants so tightly that they weren't too unlike a sausage bursting its casing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could at least take some small comfort in the fact that the cute little white and black shoes she'd picked, along with the dark purple socks, still fit her comfortably, although a small part of her wondered when they too would be stretched tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the face she'd put on and her declaration of being the 'Biggest, cutest idol in the world!', Liz was still finding that she was less accepting of her body than she'd liked to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least I'm getting the eye's of my little puppy on me,' she thought as she stretched, pale blue eyes noting that her master's own blue peepers were gazing at her barely covered bottom. \"although I still need to see that weirdo Da Vinci about new clothes if I want to avoid ending up naked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as poorly covered as she was, the lancer was still far more modestly dressed than her saber compatriot, the golden haired Emperor's lack of coverage drawing more than enough attention away from Liz....along with anything else that may be going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Liz,\" the chipper, and slightly bombastic, voice of the saber class servant came, its speaker giving the idol a swat on the rear that caused ripples to run along the soft flesh \"where is your confidence? No rival of mine would dare let herself stop just because of a few jealous gazes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to hide her body, Nero's tendency to show off skin had not lessened one bit ever since the ripening of her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEschewing any sort of top but for a red sports bra, the hefty, supple flesh of Nero's head sized breasts was squeezed so tightly that one almost though she was wearing a push-up bra, the delicate fabric serving more to keep the rosy skin of her nipples covered than give any actual form of coverage. Even now the orbs had  great valley of cleavage little more than inches away from her chin, each swaying motion of her chest threatening to spring free at but a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips and the overstuffed pillows she called a rear were kept clad in a pair of lose fitting shorts, loose being relative' that covered her assets while also accentuating them, hugging her waist and the curve of her bottom so that they could be seen but not so far as to threaten splitting, unlike her pink haired rival's bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero's stomach though was free for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill tight from this mornings feast, the bowling ball sized orb that made up the emperor's gut bounced freely in the light, the thing giving it's green eyed owner an almost pregnant appearance, not that she was ashamed of such a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, the roman's bloated form was only causing her to try and draw on even more attention than normal, her 'stretches' involving a lot more sharp movements that caused her chest to jiggle and a few more 'rubs' along the side of her stomach than normal, earning her Gudao's gaze just as much as Liz's lower half did. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call them jealous,\" the lancer said with a sigh, giving her back a last stretch that caused her shirt to rise even more \"but if you think a few looks are going to stop me than you're wrong. I was just hoping for a more private act than this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is as private as it gets,\" Mashu chimed in, the girl wearing a plain white shirt that huged her surprisingly large chest, the size of grape-fruits and spats that hugged a respectable, but soft, looking rear \"I'm afraid that I don't have the authority to restrict access to the gym.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you probably didn't even try, did you?' came the unbidden thought to Liz's mind, her eyes noting that Mashu's stomach, which had never been toned in the first place, now pooched out a bit more than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore such niggling thoughts could continue, however, Gudao took the opportunity to speak, the man giving one long stretch as he told the girls that \"Everything will be fine, we're just going to be running around and working out like everyone else. isn't that right Mashu?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lilac haired girl nodded simply before turning to the bloated pair before her, Liz already frowning at the sound of 'running around.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, we're going to test the physical abilities of all four of us to show how we've been effected by the strange event that's caused a spike in female obesity\", the demi-servant said in a manner of fact tone, her finger pointed up while her other hand rested on her hips. \"and we will begin by doing....\"</span></div></div>",

You do know we're servants right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umu!\" Nero followed up, a small pout of disappointment on her lips \"A simple act of calisthenics is nothing before us! Aren't there any grander tasks we could accomplish?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are but master believes we should take it slow.\" Mashu said, giving the black haired man a glance, \"The plan is to work our way through a series of increasingly strenuous activities to ascertain the effects of your increased weights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither the saber nor lancer seemed particularly enthusiastic about the challenge, Nero in particular being incensed that she was being underestimated, but the pair soon stepped side by side with the shielder class servant and Gudao before them, everyone ready to begin the workout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the exercise was quite simple, each person knocking out forty jumping jacks in quick succession before moving on to whatever else Mashu had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the only human of the group, the exercise left Gudao's pulse a bit quicker and his breathers a little strong but, otherwise, fairly normal, the man movements quick, fluid, and only a little tiring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe indigo haired demi-servant, likewise, had little difficulty completing the task, her breath a little bit harder than the magus's and her movements a little more...bouncy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally kept hidden behind a form obscuring hoodie and blouse, Mashu's chest was on full display thanks to the white workout shirt she wore, the fabric hugging her melons quite more than normal so that everyone watching could see them bounce with each hop, her normally stoic expression locked in one of newfound determination this day, some fire within her blazing so hot that the girl managed to beat out even her master through speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the two lighter members, the jumping jacks were routine, and uninteresting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Nero and Liz, however....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for one carnal act that had been shared but the night before, Liz had yet to do any strenuous movements or workouts with her new figure, leading to quite a few surprising sensations <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her bottom heavy nature prevented any drastic shifts in her center of gravity, the pink haired girl wasn't quite used to all the new bounces and jiggles that came with each swift movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being crammed into a pair of bike shorts, the massive rear that Liz was sporting still bounced wildly with each landing and push of the legs, the straining fabrics fighting as much as they could to keep it together while the idol's meaty thighs wobbled every time they were moved, their meeting marked by an audible clap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that poor striped shirt, struggling to keep the lancer's stomach partially covered, finally gave up and focused on keeping her breasts covered, the white and purple fabric sliding upwards on a slightly firm, and still food stuffed, stomach until the entirety of the pale orb was revealed, its movements only slightly less erratic than Liz's unbra'd chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her arms weren't exempt from excess movement, the so-called 'bingo wings' swaying so much that she would sometimes feel the skin pressing against her cheeks when her arms touched above her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still a tad humiliating, although less than Liz would normally expect, the dragon blooded countess could take some comfort in knowing that she wasn't the only royal suffering from this today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roman emperors lower half, while not as large as her rival's, bounced like a wave inside the loose red shorts she wore, thighs slapping whenever they touched, while her gut, bare for all to see, bounced two and fro as if it were filled with jello. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing compared to the blonde's bust, however, for it was something in a class entirely of its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of the vastly outclassed sports bra, Nero's tremendous boobs, each larger than her head, bobbed up and down with such force that only a miracle kept her from smacking herself in the face with those gigantic funbags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh enough to obscure her vision and low enough to slap against the top of her stuffed stomach, the emperor's cannons moved too and fro with what seemed to be a mind of their own, the meaty sacks of chest flesh threatening to pop free at any moment.... Although a careful eye could tell there was more to it than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Liz, Mashu, and Gudao simply tried to get through the workout, the saber class servant turned the exercise into something else entirely, exaggerating her movements in little ways to turn the heads on to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was thrust out a little more than should be necessary so that it could be better seen and her jumps involved a little arch of the back that pushed her chest out in a similar fashion, the stance making her look more than a little silly, which may have been the attention seeking girl's plan in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she was getting more of Gudao's gaze than Liz, along with a pout from his bespectacled kouhai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive, ten, fifteen, twenty times the girls bounced up and down, their bodies going up and down with a rhythmic motion coming from their bloated bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the end....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Dalton Harrison. To the average onlooker and bystander, you were just a normal athletic young man. However, you were anything but a normal person. To elaborate, you were always fascinated with monster movies, whether it was the classic Universal Monsters like Bela Lugosi's interpretation of Dracula of Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster, to even famous giant monsters like King Kong or Godzilla. However, such a fascination originated from your realization that you were the modern-day descendant of Vlad Tepes, better known by the moniker of \"Vlad The Impaler\", the real life inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you didn't discover such a revelation all by your lonesome, for such information was revealed to you by your beloved Servant, Lancer, better known throughout history as \"Elizabeth Bathory\", who was best known for bathing in the blood of an enormous bodycount of 600 women in order to retain her beauty and youth, which eventually led to the creation of the female vampire Carmilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, when she was inadvertently summoned by you while watching a late-night movie marathon of the Hammer Studios Dracula films, both you and Elizabeth were the equivalent of a reluctant bickering couple, always having you serve her since she was raised as a member of nobility. However, slowly but surely over time, the relationship between you and Elizabeth grew closer, bonding while watching classic monster films such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man. Although it's been 5 months since the Holy Grail War had come to a close, Elizabeth continued to stay with you out of developing this deep romantic affection towards you, despite having a petite physique and lack of womanly endowment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Holy Grail War having reached it's conclusion, life continued on as normal. However, now that she was living with you, Elizabeth had recently took up work as a Cosplay model, despite her fish-like Dragon Tail and purple Dragon horns. Currently, Elizabeth was in the shower, thoroughly washing her body since it was early in the morning, while you were out in the Living Room reviewing the Ray Harryhausen film, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms. Eventually, you noticed that Elizabeth was done with her shower, exiting out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel, looking around the room as if she was searching for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, out of curiosity, you temporarily stopped your review, looking back at the horned Servant and asked, \"Is something wrong, Elizabeth?\" \"Hone-ey! Where's the hair dryer? I can't find it!\" Elizabeth whined, obviously a little annoyed to not find the hair dryer where it usually would be. So, in response to your lover's complaining, you told her where the hair dryer was currently located in the house as you apologized, \"Sorry about that, Elizabeth. The hair dryer's in the bedroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Aww, How could I stay mad at you?\" Elizabeth replied, where she approached you and promptly kissed you on the lips before proceeding to walk into the bedroom. Fortunately, she was able to find the hair dryer resting on top of the clothes drawer. However, Elizabeth then happened to notice your personal Laptop, displaying a mischievous smirk on her youthful face. \"Hmm... I wonder what my beloved Dalton has on that laptop of his?\" Elizabeth thought to herself, as she then proceeded toward the bed where the laptop laid upon, opened it up, and saw that there were...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon looking at the images displayed onscreen, Elizabeth was simply at a loss for words from what she has witnessed upon the Internet browser. And what she bared witness to were numerous drawings of morbidly obese and rotund women on a website called DeviantArt. \"...W-What in the world?!\" Elizabeth thought to herself, her Servant mind unsure if she should be appalled or intrigued from such depictions of women with blubbery girth and bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite such portrayals of women with increased weight and bulk, the petite Dragon girl couldn't help but become allured and intrigued at the same time. So, with her curiosity piqued, Elizabeth continued to scroll through the website, looking over more and more drawings of corpulent women. One drawing portrayed an obese brunette struggling to pull a small T-shirt over her spare tire of a belly, while another drawing displayed a catgirl who happened to be so immensely fat that she was rendered immobile under her own weight and blubbery girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Elizabeth had gone through a total of 27 drawings depicting women ranging from Plus-sized to immensely corpulent and immobile, which inadvertently made you concerned since she was taking much longer than expected to find a simple hair dryer, so you decided to enter the bedroom to check up on her, only to see Elizabeth staring at the laptop screen. Of course, you spoke toward Elizabeth and asked, \"Um, Elizabeth? What are you doing with my laptop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the petite Dragon girl was able to hear you and became aware of your presence, where she then turned her head to gaze toward you. However, it was there that a seductive yet playful grin appeared on the purple horned girl's youthful face, as if she had just discovered a dirty little secret, where she then spoke toward you with a mischievous tone and said, \"*giggle* So, you're into women who have a lot of meat on their bones, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you obviously knew what she was talking about, as you felt your heart skip a beat and being in a cold sweat. So, in a mere but futile attempt to feign your disinterest in obese women, you spoke back to Elizabeth and answered, \"I, uh... I have no clue what you're talking about, Elizabeth.\" \"*giggle* Nice try, sweetie! But I think you're VERY aware of what I am talking about.\" Elizabeth replied, where she then turned the laptop around so you could see the monitor screen, which now displayed a drawing of a fatter version of Tooru from the comedic anime, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, which happened to be drawn by one of your favorite DeviantArt artists, Kawaiidebu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon having your eyes gazing at the colored drawing of the draconic female onscreen, your cheeks began to inadvertently blush a crimson hue, which obviously gave away your feelings about obese and corpulent women as clear as day and night. \"A-ha! I knew it! You're into fat women!\" Elizabeth exclaimed, being assertively proud of her supposed detective work, which made you snap back at her a little as you replied, \"Yes, yes, you found out! I'm into women who are fat as hell! But that doesn't mean I don't love you, Elizabeth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after hearing your response, Elizabeth stopped her ecstatic giggling, as the gears in her Servant mind began to turn, realizing that you still had feelings for the individual behind the infamous legend of Elizabeth Bathory, The Bloody Countess. Switching to a more serious and heartfelt tone, Elizabeth then spoke toward you, bearing a bashful look on her face and asked, \"So, um... Do you still...love me, Dalton?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Yeah, I still do, Elizabeth. I mean, you're sweet, funny, and always having a good time! It's just that I, um... I have these preferences when it comes to women, nothing more, nothing less.\" You answered, which then prompted an odd but interesting idea within the Dragon girl's mind: She should fatten herself up for your affection. \"...Well, what if I decided to gain weight for you? Would you object to that, dearie?\" Elizabeth asked, which caught your attention with ease, as you then spoke to her and answered, \"No, of course not! I wouldn't object to that, Elizabeth! I mean... If you're willing, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, in response to your answer, Elizabeth childishly skipped toward you, where she was mere inches away from you and replied, \"*giggle* ...Well, I guess it's official then, Operation: Fatty Bathory is a go!\" And with that confirmation, Elizabeth then exited out of the bedroom and into the Dining Room, her fish-like Dragon tail wagging from side to side with this sense of excitement in her movement. Of course, you soon followed her in suit, where you went into the Kitchen and grabbed something from the refrigerator, which came in the form of...</span></div></div>",

Upon seeing the large cuisine before her, Elizabeth couldn't help but swallow a gulp of hesitation at first, which only seemed to solidify her resolve, where she then spoke toward you and asked, \"Um, do I have to eat ALL of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, not all of it, Elizabeth. Just as much as your stomach can handle. Okay?\" You answered, which reassured the Dragon girl of her voluntary duty. Now realizing her objective, Elizabeth began to dig into the multi-tier chocolate cake, with a knife and fork in hand. Sh began to devour decent-sized chunks of the chocolate dessert, chewing and swallowing the cake pieces down her gullet, which slowly but surely filled up her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, 30 minutes later, Elizabeth's rate of consumption began to noticeably falter, due to her beginning to experience this uncomfortable fullness in her stomach, complete with a noticeable bulge protruding from her abdomen underneath her black and white dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being concerned for her well-being, you spoke toward the bloated Elizabeth and said, \"Okay, I think you might've had enough, Elizabeth.\" However, just as you were about to take the partially consumed cake and store it in the fridge, Elizabeth swiftly grabbed your wrist, looking at you with this persistent and determined look in her bright blue eyes, while also displaying this crimson blush on her cheeks. From there, she bluntly spoke toward you and said, \"Just *UURRP!* Just feed me, you sexy pervert! *UURRP!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust from her words alone, you could tell that Elizabeth wasn't done yet, so you decided to give the stuffed horned girl what she wanted, as you then cut out a big slice of the chocolate cake while you spoke toward her and replied, \"...Alright. Just tell me when to stop, okay?\" In response, Elizabeth gave you a firm nod in confirmation, where she then proceeded to open her mouth as wide as possible, inviting to be fed like a baby bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you gently crammed the slice of cake into Elizabeth's gaping maw, who greedily bit down and chewed on the cake before swallowing the slice down her gullet, which filled out her stomach a little more. Eventually, after several minutes of being fed by you, Elizabeth was now....</span></div></div>",
