            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a late day in May in a small suburban neighborhood. The sun was getting close to setting and the air was heavy with heat. Wiping beads of sweat off your forehead, you slowly made your way down the empty sidewalk along with your three best friends. You were all heading home after a days worth of hanging out at a nearby vacant lot. Every day after school, your little group got together until the sun set. Other than the distant sound of cicadas in the distance, the only thing to be heard was the sound of your rubber soles tapping against the hot tan sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for summer! We should just hang out like this all day long!\" Cody, the youngest of your group commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, As if you wouldn't sleep in\" Ryan, the oldest boy in the group jested.  .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd wake up if you knocked on my window or something....\" Cody sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now we're your alarm clock?\" Ryan continued to poke fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, how about the first person to wake up goes around and wakes up the rest of us? What do you think, Adam?\" Brandon, the third darker haired boy attempted to come up with a peaceful solution.  He was often the most mature and acted as a voice of reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me\" You replied out of nowhere. Brandon was always good at keeping the peace when Ryan and Cody.were going at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! It told you it was a good idea!\" Cody boasted pridefully with his arms crossed and head high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to wake you up LAST\" Ryan sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey!\" Cody whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you two ever just get along?\" Brandon groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan's the one who always starts it....\" Cody whispered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaah I'm starving\" Ryan groaned with hunger, clenching his belly dramatically. Ryan was the oldest of the four at 12, You and Brandon were 11, and Cody was the youngest at 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your appetite is ridiculous dude. I'm never letting you back in my house after you scarfed down those two entire bags of chips!\" Brandon spoke condescendingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, boy's gotta eat\" Ryan hummed happily with his eyes closed, probably remembering how much he enjoyed eating those chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to walk at the front of the pack, you couldn't help but smile at the usual antics of your friends. They were all so different, but for some reason, you all just had such a great bond. You honestly couldn't imagine how your life would be without them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody, who was still a little upset about Ryan's teasing suddenly noticed a trail of ants crossing a dirt covered area alongside the side-walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANTS!!\" The boy shouted gleefully as he stepped off the pathway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh here we go again...\" Brandon sighed. Cody always had a cruel obsession with crushing any bug that crossed his line of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're probably building up a lot of karma by doing that.\" Brandon added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody didn't seem to pay the other boy any mind as he raised his worn-out converse sneaker over the small line of ants, covering them in shadow. You couldn't help but watch Cody's happily sinister expression as he slowly lowered his foot onto the tiny fleeing insects. \"SQUUUISSHHH\" The blonde chuckled to himself as his rubber sole made contact with the dirt.  Any semblance of life was instantly crushed under the 10 year old's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffft, what do you expect? He's just compensating  because he's so short\" Ryan chuckled. Cody looked up at the taller boy with a deep glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I wish YOU were a bug\" Cody grinded his foot firmly into the soft dry dirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooOoO I'm terrified\" The taller boy rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you continued walking until you reached the Maple intersection. Each of you lived in different directions from this point on. Waving to each other, you all gave each other your usual farewells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n[That night]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to pull on a pair of blue pajamas, you began hopping on one leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh~ woah!\" You nearly fall over when you suddenly see an odd green light shoot through the sky outside your bedroom window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Wh-what was that?\" You press your face up against the window glass, squinting your eyes for whatever had created the entrancing luminescence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you noticed a faint green glow down by the outskirts of your yard. You turned your head from side to side to see if any of the other neighbors had seen it themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing more and more curious with each passing second, you decided that you should investigate. Slowly making your way down the stairs to avoid any unnecessary suspicion, you quietly tip-toed to the back door. Pulling the slide door open, you quickly started to tread across the back yard. The cool grass against your bare-feet tickled with each footstep. Scanning the grass as you continued on, your eyes suddenly noticed the familiar green glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit cautions, you picked up a nearby stick and inched yourself closer to the strange glowing object. It was about the size of a small rock.  The light that emitted from it seemed to almost pulsate as if it were alive. With stick in hand, you carefully began to poke it. To your surprise, the faint glowing began to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer sensing that there was any immediate danger, you slowly began to reach for the small stone. After a few light touches, you grasped your fingers around it, bringing it up to your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What IS this thing...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting your parents to find you standing alone in the dark, you quickly made your way back into your house, concealing the stone firmly in the palm of your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet the guys wouldn't even believe me if I told them..\" You whispered to yourself after closing your bedroom door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that you would show them your new discovery at........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell of your mom's breakfast filled the air, though you'd probably only get to take a bite because of how late you were running. Memory of the mysterious stone suddenly stirred in your mind, as you noticed it sitting on the wooden dresser where you had placed it the night before. Quickly stuffing it into your pocket, you began a mad dash down the stairs and into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gobbling down as much eggs and toast as you could, you ran out the front door. The loud slapping of your sneakers against the pavement echoed throughout the quiet waking neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing as you reached your destination, you looked up to see Cody, Ryan, and Brandon all standing at the bus stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me, your alarm didn't go off?\" Brandon rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, someone keeps unplugging it!\" You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaah yeeaah\" Brandon replied dryly as he put his backpack on the ground, unzipping it to pull out his DS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cody and Ryan were busy arguing about something they had watched on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was going so fast that you almost completely forgot to mention the stone you had found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You darted your hand back and forth within your pocket before realizing it wasn't there. Just as you were starting to worry that it might had fallen out, you reached into your other pocket and immediately felt it's rough texture against your fingers. Smiling with relief, you began to pull the small stone out when......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange wave of heat quickly traveled up your arm and passed through the rest of your body. Your vision started to blur and your mind became increasingly fuzzy. You attempted to call to your friends, but your voice only came out like a soft mumble. All of them were too busy focusing on other things to notice you wobbling in place.  The world around you started to spin as you felt your body collapse onto the open backpack in front of you. You had passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nThe sound of the school bus' engine roared louder as it made it's way to your stop. The breaks made a loud screech as it came to a halt in front of the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, just one more day... just one more day...\" Ryan groaned as he stepped onto the bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you didn't even study for the final right?\" Cody poked as he followed closely behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon turned around to place his DS into his backpack when he noticed you were no longer standing behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Where the heck did he go?\" He quickly assumed that you probably forgot your homework or something. Not giving it another thought, the oblivious boy zipped the backpack tightly closed and hopped onto the bus; the doors closing heavily behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>[dream sequence] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in gym class. The large room is divided by a single wall to keep guys on one side and girls on the other. The florescent lights above you almost seemed a bit brighter than usual, making the room devoid of shadow. You could slightly hear a small electrical buzzing sound coming from the bulbs above you; other than that, it was eerily silent for a gymnasium. It was very clear that you were all alone, but you didn't know why. Where was everyone else? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if answering your question, a mob of boys all around your age started to run right past you from behind. The sound of their excited chatter was accompanied by the slapping of rubber soles against the freshly waxed gymnasium floor. Everyone seemed to be lining up against the far wall to take their sneakers off. You knew right away that this meant we were going to play sockker. It's pretty much indoor soccer played with a foam balls while wearing socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a new rush of air as Brandon ran past you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Common dude!\" He called you over to join them with an excited smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting aside the strange surreal feeling you've been experiencing, you decide to join in; besides, it was one of your favorite gym games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall was pretty much lined with sneakers at this point. Brandon found a gap near the middle and added his sneakers to the line. As he ran off to play, you found that there was just enough space next to his sneakers for you to place your own. After sliding both of your sneakers off, you suddenly felt a familiar wave of warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"w-...what......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room begins to spin as you collapsed. The last thing you see is Brandon's sneaker's rushing towards you as you passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an instant later, you find yourself standing in a large dark cavern. An unusually potent odor surrounds you, causing you to cover your nose. Trying to take in your surroundings only confuses you more. All around you were large curved walls, none of which looked like they were made of stone. Behind you was total darkness that seemed to extend further into the cave like structure. What puzzled you the most was the floor. It almost had a spongy quality to it, and also felt a bit moist as well, as evidenced by the dampness of your socks. There was only one source of light high above.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh!\" w-where am I?!\" Sweat started to form on your forehead due to the bizarre heat that seemed to radiate within the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance you could hear the sound of loud thumping and boys laughing. You squint your eyes to the blinding light shining above you. As your eyes began to adjust to the brightness, you started to make out a familiar looking ceiling. The bright florescent lights and metallic ceiling were a dead give away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... I'm still in the gym??!\" The sound of your classmates and the brightness finally clicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...where am I right now?!\" You certainly don't remember a place like this in the gym. Did you fall into a strange hole or something? No, there's no way a hole this big could have just appeared without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to get a little worried, you try to climb up the sides of the curved wall, only to lose your grip and fall back to the soft floor. Even if you could get a good hold on the wall  there was no way you could climb up to the top. It would be like climbing up a small building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS ANYONE THERE?! HELP!\" You shouted up towards the light, hoping that someone would hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes had passed and you hadn't made any progress. You began to considered following the dark path into the cave behind you, but were afraid you'd miss an opportunity to be rescued from wherever you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud whistle pierced  the air. You covered your ears in discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... that whistle means the period is over.... They still don't know I'm trapped! WAIT! GUYS! BRANDON!! ANYONE HELP!!\" You begin to panic in fear of being left alone in this dark place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud thumping grew louder as you felt the floor under you vibrate. A shadow blocked out the light above you. IT WAS BRANDON. Your excitement quickly shifted to nervousness as you realized that something was terribly wrong. Brandon looked HUGE from your perspective. Almost as if you were watching him on a movie theater screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you, the familiar sound of socked-feet being stuffed into sneakers echoed throughout the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it hit you. The cavern, the perspective, the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. that's impossible I...I can't be...\" You had only just noticed the Adidas symbol across the large wall in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in Brandon's sneaker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, you could see Brandon's smiling face, eager to get his sneakers back on as he raised his socked foot over the opening of the worn-out sneaker. The sole of his sock looked damp with sweat and a little dirty from running around the gym. It had completely cohered to shape of his sole; His toes outlined perfectly through the dingy fabric.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B...BRANDON!! NO!!!\" Your plea seemed to go unheard as the foot continued it's descent, blocking out the light completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed in horror as you ran towards the cave behind you. Your best friend's toes pressed down onto the sponge surface, exactly where you were been standing a moment ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO NO NO! BRANDON I'M IN HERE! PLEASE DON'T DO THIS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of the danger his best friend was in, Brandon slid his sweaty, heated foot into the cool confined space. What reason did he have to check his sneakers before putting them on? Even if there were a bug trapped inside, it's not l like it was any concern to him. He didn't even notice as the balls of his feet passed over his tiny friend. Stuffing his heel in with a soft 'thump', he along with the rest of the boys were ready to get on with their day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled desperately against the moist grey fabric, all of your screams were muffled by the damp sock that now soaked your clothes with sweat. Little did you realize that your movements were only irritating your giant friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRANDON PLEASE!! HELP ME!! I'M IN YOUR SNEAKER BRA-....\" You paused as you felt the sneaker rise up into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt an odd itching against the balls of his right foot. Not realizing it was his best friend's struggling form, he didn't feel obligated to take his sneaker off to check and see. Instead, he raised his sneaker into the air and stamped down a few times until the annoying movements were replaced by a small 'crunch'. Finally satisfied, Brandon walked out of the gym, not even noticing that your sneakers were still up against gymnasium wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAGGHHH!!!!\" You woke up in a cold sweat, breathing as if you'd just run a marathon. Realizing that it was just a nightmare, you heart was flooded with relief. It was only until you noticed that you were in total darkness that fear began to creep up your spine. Wherever you were was shaking back and forth, causing you to tumble  across an unknown surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just another dream... this is just another dream\" You chanted to yourself over and over again. Any minute now you'd wake up in your warm bed to the smell of breakfast. Without any warning, the movements stopped abruptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a dream It's just a dream\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud zipping sound pierced your ears as light entered the darkness from above. Your heart seized as you looked up at the familiar face of your best friend. You screamed as his massive hand reached down towards your location. </span></div></div>",

You found yourself sliding down into unknown darkness as what looked like a tree sized pen topped over right next to you. It was starting to become clear that this 'nightmare' might actually be real.  Somehow it seems as though you've been shrunk down to the size of a crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you remembered everything. That moment at the bus-stop when you grasped the stone in your pocket. That dizzy light-headed feeling right before you passed-out. Somehow you shrunk and landed inside your best friend's backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally retrieving whatever it was he had been searching for, Brandon's hand pulled back out. You cried out desperately for his attention only to be answered by the sound of his zipper sealing you back into the darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOO!!! BRANDON!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in his desk during homeroom, Brandon could have sworn he heard a small squeak as he zipped his backpack closed. Deciding his ears were playing tricks on him, he turned his attention to the front of the class where the teacher was starting his lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get out of here....\" You thought to yourself in a frantic state of hyper sensitivity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached into your pocket for the rock, but found that it was no longer there. It must have fallen out of your pocket while you were tumbling around. It's likely that it was the reason that you ended up like this, so maybe there was a chance it could bring you back to normal. You wriggled your way through notebooks and folders in search for the small stone. There were moments when you found yourself totally awestruck by the incredible size of everyday objects like an eraser or pencil sharpener. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour search continued for what seemed like the rest of the period until the loud bell rang, signaling that you should hold on to something. Just as you assumed, the backpack began to shake violently as it's owner picked it up and began to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all the turbulence, a massive shed sized object toppled over right next to you. Had you been standing an inch away, you'd easily had been crushed. Getting over your near-death experience, you suddenly realize that the object seemed kind of familiar. Your suspicion turned to shock when you finally recognized it. It was the stone. Somehow it didn't shrink along with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could decide what to do, the backpack began to open once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon walked casually into the boy's locker room with the backpack over his shoulder. After giving a few high-fives as he walked through small room, he came to a stop in front of his locker. As usual, the room smelled of sweat. Both Ryan and Cody were already there, getting changed into their gym shorts. The four friends were able to pick their lockers as a group so that they could be right next to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, have you seen Adam around?\" Brandon asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, he was at the bus stop though right?\" Ryan responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I didn't see him get on, I think he ran back home to get something\" Brandon replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he just decided to play hookie for the day\" Cody added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without telling us?\" Brandon unzipped his back pack to retrieve his gym shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how Adam is, always being so quiet and secretive\" Cody responded smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there's nothing wrong with not being a loud mouth like YOU shrimp\" Ryan sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Cody pushed the taller boy only to be pushed back, making him fall over. The boy's butt landed with a heavy thud onto Brandon's backpack, causing it to fall onto it's side in the process. A few of the backpack's items scattered across the locker room floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!\" Brandon yelled as started picking up a few of his things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He pushed me!\" Cody shouted as he lifted himself off the flattened backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pushed first dude\" Ryan replied coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Look what you did to my sandwich!\" Brandon pulled out his wrapped up sandwich, now the width of a pancake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you! It wasn't my....\" Cody stopped as he noticed the strange looking rock next to the opening of Brandon's backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... what's this...\" He asked curiously has he reached and picked up the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh.. I don't know, it's not mine\" Brandon replied as he continued picking up his stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody gripped it as hard as he could, causing a piece to chip off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a really old dirt clod or something...I love these things..Hey, watch this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody threw the rock into a nearby wall, causing it to instantly disintegrate into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gym teacher's going to be mad if he see's that mess you know.\" Brandon spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah...\" Cody started to spread the dust across the floor with his foot, as if to disperse it out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Cody noticed something else on the floor, but this one was a bit smaller, and MOVING. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUG!\" Cody shouted with a huge grin forming across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nJust as you were a moment from reaching the surface of the stone, something unexpected happened. You felt like you were being thrown from a speeding car as the backpack jolted suddenly. You along with various other school supplies erupted out of the back pack, onto the stone floor outside. After you came to a stop, you clutched your arm in pain. You weren't seriously hurt, but you had fallen on it pretty hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience only became more traumatic as you took in your new surroundings. Your three best friends now towered over you like titans. Yards away from you, their gigantic socked feet were the size of stadiums. You had to crane your head back all the way just to see the bottom of their chins. It was hard to even consider them your friends from this perspective, they were like gods now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart started to race as Brandon began to pick up a bunch of things that had fallen out of his backpack. You waved your arms in an attempt to get his attention, but it seemed as though you were too insignificant to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you spotted the stone a few yards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" You ran towards it knowing that this might be your last chance to make contact with it. You were unsure if it had the ability to bring you back, but it was your only hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY...WHAT'S THIS\" Your heart skipped a beat as an impossibly large hand came down and enveloped the stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no!..\" You could do nothing as watch as Cody brought the stone up to his face to inspect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Cody's destructive nature, you could only pray he that wouldn't......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMASH* The stone exploded against the locker room wall, causing dust to slowly descend onto the floor around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you felt like you had reached rock bottom, things just continued to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously craned your head up across the vertical landscape that was now Cody. To your complete and utter terror, he was staring directly at you, a familiar grin spread across his boyish face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The 10 year old licked his lips as his socked-foot hovered directly over you, posed to stomp the tiny insect at his feet. The experience was even more vivid than your nightmare. The boy's toes wriggled with anticipation as the shadow of his foot encompassed you entirely. You remembered all the times you had wrestled Cody to the ground and tickled this very foot in order to put him into submission. Now that relatively small foot was capable of crushing you in an instant. Cody had never been a threat to anyone or anything, anything but bugs....but now you were so small that there was hardly much of a difference, at least not to Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody seemed to take his time, almost as if he wanted to see you run. You couldn't though, your legs were locked in place out of total fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vast grey surface above you was clearly damp. Little specks of cotton slowly dropped from the vast sole as he wriggled his toes, causing the fabric to stretch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't resist it any longer, he wanted to crush the tiny bug so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye...\" Cody whispered with a smirk as his foot came down quickly. There was an audible smacking sound as the sock-clad foot made contact with the hard surface of the floor. Cody could also feel a tiny crunch, making him happily hum with satisfaction. His toes curled with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody lifted his head to find that the class had already left to the gymnasium. Not even checking to see the red blotch now smeared across his sole, Cody slid his sneakers on an ran after the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's full of peaks and valleys in seemingly every direction. The wall seems to never end and in the distance, there's others. From all around you hear your friends but, their voices are deep and powerful. They shake your body with every word. As you examine the landscape, you begin to look up and then, it becomes clear. You've inexplicably shrunken to a rather speck like size in front of your bickering friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the stench hit you. Cody wore only his flip flops, his massive feet were sweating in the hot sunlight above, keeping you in their shade. All around you were surrounded by the musky scent of it and the flip flop, hot sweat and rubber brought together. It was almost overpowering to your bug-like form, though truth be told, you were less than a bug. You were in the presence of titans, deities. What could you do in their presence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was soon answered. In the heated debate, Cody dropped his phone, it created earthquakes as it boomed against the ground. You have no time to run as he crouches down to get it, his foot angling upward and toes reaching over the edge. The powerful structures are enormous. They loom out and crush you into the ground and you stick like dirt. Your all powerful friends now had you as Cody stood and boarded the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir blasts against you, the world spins, and you are helpless throughout, forced to enjoy the ride.</span></div></div>",

Secretly, the three of you have been putting together a huge surprise party for Brandon weeks in advance. The three of you didn't have jobs yet, so the real present was going to be the party itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was for Ryan to lure Brandon away from his house to go searching for you and Cody. Meanwhile the two of you would sneak into Brandon's room and decorate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had a good twenty minutes to hang everything up and set out the food and drinks. The centerpiece would be a huge bowl full of Brandon's favorite dip that you had home-made yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you got together under an old oak tree in Ryan's yard and put your hands together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets make this Brandon's best birthday yet\" You shouted. The three of you cheered and broke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:00PM Ryan knocks on Brandon's door and invites him to go pick up you and Cody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:05PM After Brandon and Ryan were out of sight, you and Cody ran up to his house with bags of streamers, drinks, cake,  and a huge bowl of dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:07PM Ryan and Brandon make it to Cody's house to find that he isn't around. They decided to check your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:10PM Both you and Cody are half way through decorating the room. You set up a small table in the center to put the dip. Next to it you placed a small vanilla cake.  You also twisted off the caps of a few bottles of sprite for later. Above the table you hung a paper chandelier. All around the parameter of the room you dangled colorful paper-linked-chains. As sort of a joke, you covered a whole bunch of random stuff in the room with pink bows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:15PM After realizing neither you or Cody were at your house, they began to head back to Brandon's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:20PM Everything was set. Both you and Cody were breathing heavily, but you had pulled it off. The room looked great. All you had to do now was wait for Ryan and Brandon to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I need to go to the bathroom real bad!\" Cody danced in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! What if you miss it! I told you not to drink that soda before the party!\" You spoke down on your friend condescendingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know! I'll be back before he gets here!\" With that the younger boy ran out into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed with annoyance as you noticed that the paper chandelier was somewhat off-balance. Standing on one of the chairs, you reached over and began to adjust the hanging decoration......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you felt an indescribable heat flood across your body from where you had pocketed the small rock from last night. It was like a pulse of heat that made your entire body shutter. Almost immediately you felt yourself get light-headed. Your sense of balance began to dissolve as you started to tip over onto the table below you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of getting closer to the dip, it was almost as if it were getting further away. No, it wasn't that it was getting further away, it's as if it was getting BIGGER. It only lasted an instant before the feeling of free-falling came back, but now it felt as if you were falling from the top of a building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wwhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed in total terror as the bowl below you seemed to grow to the size of a stadium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small 'splat' you hit the surface of the vast gooey dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries of fear were muffled by the thick substance that now covered your entire body. You frantically tried to keep yourself surfaced within the chunky white dip. <br>\r\nThat was when the scent hit you. The aroma was overwhelming. Sure from a normal perspective it probably smelled delicious, but when you're the size of a crumb, it's simply too much for your senses to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWESOME, YOU GUYS EVEN BROUGHT MY FAVORITE DIP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped your struggles the moment the booming voice hit your ears. You turned you self to find that you were now covered in shadow. Up above was your three best friends standing in front of the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-GUYS!!!!! DOWN HERE!!!\" You attempted to wave while keeping yourself surfaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three boys were looking directly into the bowl, but their expressions didn't seem to have any hint of urgency or shock; Instead, their eyes looked a bit glazed and distant. The horrifying realization hits you the moment you hear Brandon's stomach growl from beyond the rim of the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....n..No..NO HEY HEY!! GUYS I'M DOWN HERE!! DON'T EAT THE DIP!! LOOK GUYS!!\" You must have perfectly blended in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour veins run cold with fear as your friends all reach across the table for a moment, only to return with chips in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOooooO!!!!!!!!\" You scream as the hungry boys began their meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'm ready!.............Adam?\" Cody ran into the room excitedly, only to find that you were no longer there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ADAM? Dude, where are you? They'll be here any se-....\" The younger boy was suddenly interrupted by the sound of the front door opening. He had no choice but to re-focus his attention on Brandon's  surprise arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly hiding behind Brandon's bed, Cody held his breath as the sound of footsteps in the hallway got closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft creak the door opened widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISE!!!!!\" Both Cody and Ryan popped the streamers they had been concealing in their pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!' After the initial sock, Brandon grinned from ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday dude!\" Cody waved from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I feel so stupid, I should have known you guys were going to do something like this\" Brandon couldn't contain his excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where's Adam?\" All three boys paused for a moment and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...I'm not really sure ...\" Cody mumbled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't he helping you set up?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was! but...he kinda just disappeared...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... huh... knowing Adam, I bet he's going to try to surprise me again\" Brandon grinned as he looked around the decorated room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NICE! You even made my favorite dip!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Adam knew you'd like it. We're all kinda starving though..\" the younger laughed awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys slowly surrounded the bowl of dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we wait for Adam?\" Brandon asked hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he'd understand. He really wanted you to enjoy this anyways.\" Ryan replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very likely that the boys would have made virtually ANY excuse to dig into the yummy looking dip sitting before them. The insides of all three boy's mouths began to sub-consciously salivate as they began to reach for the bowl of chips. </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for you, you had landed more or less in the middle of the pool of chunky white dip. Struggling with all your might, you began forcing your way through the goopy substance. The chunks of onion seemed like they were about the size of basketballs, meaning that you were probably only around a quarter of an inch in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rim of the bowl was pretty high up, but the wall itself wasn't very steep; With any luck you'd be able to scale it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you, the sound of massive chips being plunged into the thick creamy dip seemed almost constant. Being completely focused on making it to the outer wall, you were unable to see which chip belonged to who as they rained down into the bowl, one after the other. The boys were gobbling it up so quickly that there wasn't a single moment when a chip wasn't scooping up dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, the horrifying sound of crunching pervaded the air. The occasional \"MMmmm~\" could be heard as the boys savored the delicious flavor of the white colored dip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the moment you had fallen in, your entire body was absolutely coated with the cream. Every few paddles forward, you would find your self wiping the dip from your eyes, just so you could see where you were going. You quickly found that creating distance within the bowl was a great challenge. The substance was so thick that you'd probably have a better chance trying to swim in a pool of pudding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a minute had past and you were already exhausted. The only thing that didn't seem to weaken were your friend's appetites. You couldn't help but feel your hopes dwindling as the level of the dip quickly dropped lower and lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUUUUYS!! STOP EATING!!!! GUUYS STOOOOOOOP!!!\" You paused a moment to wave frantically towards the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crunch* \"Mmm~ are you *chew* sure we shouldn't *chew* leave some for Adam? *gulp* I'm worried we might end up downing it all before he gets here \"  Brandon asked as he reached for another chip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*gulp* \"Nah, he made this dip himself, you know how humble he can get sometimes\" Cody licked his lips of the creamy dip as he grabbed another chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above you could hear your friends talking about you, all the while you were screaming for their attention. At this point you were pretty much gasping for air due to utter exhaustion. All of the progress you attempted to make was sabotaged each time a layer of dip was pulled from the bowl, causing the dip around you to be pulled back to refill the empty space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart seized as the shadow of a chip came down right next to you. Panicking, you used your last bit of strength to escape. However, you  underestimated the sheer size of the chip. Below you, you could feel a force lifting you up along with the thick layer of dip surrounding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononnonono!!!\" You cried as the world around you plummeted. The sound of crunching and gulping were now louder than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes started to water in fear as you found yourself now in front of......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

STOOOOOOP!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10 year old had to have already consumed dozens of chips by now, but the look in his eyes still indicated that he was still rather hungry. You could tell from his focused expression that he was in consume mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you were clearly afraid, you couldn't help but feel a slight twinge of anger towards the giant. Had he not gone to the bathroom, he would have noticed when you shrunk. Now he was putting your very life in jeopardy while eating the food you had made for him and the rest of your friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK CODY!!! LOOK DOWN!!! CODY!!\" You screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody WAS looking down, but not at you, he was already eyeing the next chip that he was going to take after he was finished with the one he was holding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware that he was only a few actions away from devouring you, Cody slowly began opening his mouth for the next yummy bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wet lips opened wide as gooey translucent ropes of saliva draped across the inside of his mouth. The massive dark abyss above his throat opened widely as his tongue glistened with a thick coating of enzymes. All across the wet cavern were globby remains of recent chips, yet to be swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh~\" Cody vocalized as he slowly pushed the chip forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COOOOODDDDYYY!!!\" The shadow of the Cody's mouth enveloped you as you entered. Drips of the boy's saliva quickly coated the tasty wedge-shaped snack as the white dip slowly poured onto his eagerly awaiting tongue. The delicious taste of newly delivered dip registered to his tasting muscle, causing him to close his eyes as he savored the flavor. Pushing the rest of the chip in with one finger, Cody's mouth closed with a muffled *CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing away happily, Cody quickly reached for the next chip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHH!!!\" You cry in fear as you're violently tumbled and thrown across the vast wet maw. You're almost instantly soaked by his saliva as you're added to the collective mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we should really save the rest for Adam, Brandon spoke, having had his fill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaah alright......\" Ryan starting to feel a bit guilty himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody could only nod, as his mouth was still full; not for very long though....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE CODY GET ME OUT OF HERE!! GET ME OU <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GUUUUULP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head back slightly, Cody gulped, causing his throat to bob. To the boy's around the table, it was hardly noticeable, but for you it was the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we go better find Adam\" Cody smiled as he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, all three boys walked away from the bowl, only a few chip's worth of dip remained. They had decimated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam better make some of that dip for MY party\" Ryan muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Adam sure makes a good snack!\" Cody chirped as his stomach began to digest. <br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried in the hot darkness of Cody's stomach. Hitting agasint the goo coated walls seemed to prove pointless. It didn't take long for the acids to begin to fill the organ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out uncomfortable, but it slowly became more and more excruciating as your skin started to burn. You lifted your hand into the air and screamed to be let out with every fiber of your being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were totally unheard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cody continued walking and talking with his friends. Occasionally laughing as they joked about where you could have gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one knew as you were turned to a nutritious soup in Cody's growing body. It was quite tragic that your entire life had led up to this, digested by one of your closest friends along with the meal you prepared for him. </span></div></div>",

He didn't even bother to look at the chip he was about to shove into his mouth, already thinking about how many more he would eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were petrified. Ryan always ate everything in sight, so you could imagine what quick and cruel fate awaited you if he did eat you, all the more reason to continue to yell and scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RYAN!!! STOOOOOOP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan opened his mouth (a gigantic cavern to you), revealing the dark pathway to your doom, surrounded by teeth with bits of previous chip victims caught in between them. He shoved the chip inside, and darkness quickly surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH* Ryan happily chewed up the chip he had just eaten whole.

If he wants some, he'll get here before I eat it all.\" Ryan laughs and takes another chip, covering most of it in dip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel angry after hearing what Ryan said in booming surround sound. You went through the trouble of making the snack for everyone, and Ryan isn't even going to save you any. Not like it really matters at this point, though, since you are the snack and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ryan ate the next chip, he pushed the chewed-up one occupying his mouth to the back of his throat, taking you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no no no NO NO NO NO NO NO NO RYAN DON'T--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GUUUUUULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan swallowed and sighed satisfyingly. The lump of food traveled down his throat and into his stomach, as he took a bite of his next chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on Ryan, I think we should look for Adam.\" Brandon suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, fine, whatever!\" Ryan frustratingly got up, swinging his big bare feet off the couch and onto the floor, \"I'm still gonna eat most of Adam's chips even if we do find him,\" Ryan said, finishing the one in his hand, \"I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried hysterically in the gurgling darkness of Ryan's belly, starting to be burned alive in the stomach acid that had obliterated chips soon before you. As the acid began to take your final moments, you screamed with everything you had, as your clothes melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ryan, Cody, and Brandon all looked around for you, joking about how you were probably hiding off somewhere as a second surprise. They thought it fitting to you that you would have a second plan to surprise all of them. You were always looking to quietly one-up everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Adam, we get it. Just come out, clearly we can't find you!\" Ryan shouted, followed by a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stepped back, \"Dang, that smells awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan chuckled at his friend's disgust, and unleashed an even longer burp in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...how about that one?\" Ryan smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I don't think Adam's here.\" Brandon said, starting to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thing you heard, as you let out your last breath, falling into the acid lake. That was it. Your whole life, gone in an instant as you digested a nutritious soup for one of your best friends. His growing body would soon make good use of you, and your friends would never figure out that you were eaten along with the snack that you had prepared.</span></div></div>",

It was sprite, you had fallen into a 20oz bottle of sprite!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that there was nothing to grab onto, you instantly began to worry that you would drown.

You're already hiding right?\" Cody smiled as he caught on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly hiding behind Brandon's bed, Cody held his breath as the sound of footsteps in the hallway got closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft creak the door opened widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISE!!!!!\" Both Cody and Ryan popped the streamers they had been concealing in their pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!' After the initial sock, Brandon grinned from ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday dude!\" Cody waved from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I feel so stupid, I should have known you guys were going to do something like this\" Brandon couldn't contain his excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where's Adam?\" All three boys paused for a moment and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...I'm not really sure ...\" Cody mumbled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't he helping you set up?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was! but...I kinda thought he was hiding....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... huh... knowing Adam, I bet he's going to try to surprise me again\" Brandon grinned as he looked around the decorated room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the four bottles of sprite, Brandon began to lick his dry lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh man, i'm so thirsty after doing all that walking around\" he spoke as he reached for one of the bottles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, go for it dude, relax, it's your party after all!\" Cody laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded as he brought the bottle up to his lips and began to chug as if he hadn't had water in days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as your friends celebrated the surprise. Despite your situation, you couldn't help but feel a bit guilty for missing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeating on the plastic wall in front of you, you screamed for your friends to notice you. The boys were too busy enjoying each other's company to notice  a small speck floating in a bottle of sprite on the nearby table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUYS!! HELP!!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!! GUUUUYS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the giants laughed amongst themselves until Brandon's eyes focused on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES YESS!!! BRANDON HERE!!\" Your heart sang as he walked over and reached towards the bottle, gripping it firmly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled widely as Brandon brought you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to make one crazy story huh g.........h-hey, Brandon....w-wait what are you..\" You felt your chest constrict with fear when you realized that Brandon had stopped raising the bottle. The opening was now pressed up against his lips. You looked up with horror at the circular opening as his lips puckered around the hole. The water around you started to shift as the bottle began to tilt horizontally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-BRANDON! STOP!! NO!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could instantly feel the pull of the current as what seemed like gallons upon gallons of sprite poured through Brandon's massive thirsty lips. You began to frantically swim in the opposite direction, practically crying with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the splashing of the fluid, all you could hear were Brandon's loud gulps as the level of sprite within the bottle dropped almost an inch every two seconds. From your perspective, it almost seemed impossible for a person to swallow this much fluid in just a few gulps. Then the reality of the situation hit you. Of course it's not impossible, there were only 20 ounces in this bottle, not gallons. A regular sized person would have no problem gulping down a few ounces like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard you tried to swim you couldn't fight it. Brandon's thirst was simply too great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-PLEASE!! BRANDON!!!! NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOO!!!\" You cried as the bottle went vertical. Down below you could see his lips puckering as the sides of the bottle started to collapse under both the air pressure and the giant boy's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a shots worth of sprite remained. You desperately beat against the walls of the neck of the bottle with your tiny fists towards your friends on the outside. Your last speck of hope was snuffed out when you realized they were chanting \"CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG\" ......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pulled the empty bottle from his lips and swallowed hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHhhhhhhh~\" The 11 year old smiled as he licked his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NICE DUDE!!!\" Ryan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah, I told you I was thirsty!\" Brandon grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a light 'plop' you had fallen headfirst into the creamy white frosting of the now MASSIVE vanilla cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all around you, the sweet smell, the taste, the texture. You struggled desperately to pull yourself out. Your socked feet were the only thing visible on the outside, dangling frantically. Finally getting a wriggling movement down, you eventually pulled yourself to the surface. You gasped for air as you surveyed your surroundings. All around you was a vast field of white. Had this only been a dream, it probably would have been kinda nice. Your entire body was covered with frosting, just trying to get it out of your eyes was a challenge. Judging from the vastness around you, it's likely that you had shrunk to a quarter of an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou subconsciously licked your lips of the frosting; It was actually really tasty. You couldn't help but lick some more from your hand, which was thoroughly covered. Unfortunately, it seems that you had landed somewhere near the middle of the cake. There didn't really seem like any other option other than roughing it across the endless looking white surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of your footsteps caused your feet to sink in up to your shin, making in an incredibly arduous journey. In a way, you sort of felt like an escomo traveling across the antarctic. The only thing that kept the fantasy from being too believable was the inescapable scent of vanilla and the obvious background of Brandon's room. It didn't take long before your socks to be pulled off your feet and left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had only made it two inches when Cody came back from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CODY!!!! CODY DOWN HERE!!!!!\" You yelled loudly while waving your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed totally unaware of your attempts to get his attention as he scanned the room for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud booming noise of the front door opening made you cover your ears in pain. You could only watch as Cody ran behind Brandon's bed. A few moments later Ryan and Brandon walked in. You quickly covered your ears for the inevitable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUUUUPRIIIIIIISEEE\" The two boys shouted at the top of their lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that maybe your best option would be to stay on the surface of the cake. It would probably be the best way to get their attention when they  eventually decide to come over and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NICE CAKE!!!!\" Brandon walked over and inspected the delicious looking dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we know how much you like vanilla\" Ryan added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it...\" Brandon slid finger around the base of the cake and brought it up to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm~\" He hummed as he sucked the frosting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey hey!\" Wait until after your wish!. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh  no....\" You had totally forgotten about the candles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam was supposed to put the candles in\" Cody lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he anyways?\" Brandon asked suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me, he kinda just disappeared.\" Cody answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, he's probably planned a special surprise of his own\" Ryan added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably...\" Brandon reaffirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody began to puncture the cake's surface with candles.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed to Cody as the candles came down all around you. A part of you feared that he would accidentally get a direct hit on you, plunging you deep into the surface of the cake. <br>\r\nAfter the 15th candle, you let out a sigh of relief. Ryan began setting the candles ablaze, making you cover your eyes due to the heat they radiated. It was so humiliating, even birthday candles were a danger to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAAPPPY BIIIRTHDAYY TOOOO YOUUU\"~<br>\r\n\"HAAAPPPY BIIIRTHDAYY TOOOO YOUUU\"~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAAPPPY BIIIRTHDAYY DEAR BRANDON\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAPPYY BIIIIIIITHHHDAAAAY TOOOOOOOO\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh oh...If I don't find something to grab onto....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOUUUUU~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hide behind a candle, but it was too late. A hurricane like gust of air sent you flying across the surface of the cake, eventually causing you to plummet into the thick frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. time to eat!\" The three boys began to salivate as Brandon cut the first two slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping your head out of the frosting, you began wiping your eyes. Blown away by your best friends breath, how embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you had cleared your eyes, you quickly noticed that something was different. The surface of the cake seemed to have shrunk!... Were you growing back? Your hopes were dashed when you noticed that the cake had simply been cut into pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...that means...\" You lifted your head up to find that you were now in the shadow of Ryan, staring down at the slice of cake under you with hungry intent. A horrifyingly large fork was lifted in the air above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n--NOOOOOOOO!!! RYAANNNN!! STOOOOP!!\" You cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan didn't notice the tiny speck on his cake as he plunged his fork into the tasty looking dessert. Lifting the spongy white substance to his mouth, he quickly consumed it, bringing his fork back for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface of the cake was just as thick and difficult to move in as before. The difference was that you no longer had the luxury to just go at your own pace. Up above you was a hungry kid who was likely very intent on devouring every last bit of the cake you were now standing on. Knowing Ryan's appetite, you knew the danger was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~ Great cake Cody!\" Ryan hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! I told you I could bake a cake!\" Cody smiled as he gobbled down his own slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda wish Adam were here though..\" *gulp* Brandon replied almost sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, I'm sure he's right under our noses\" Ryan muttered as he lifted the last portion of his cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RYANNN NOOO STOOOOP!!!\" You were so close to the edge of the cake, it would have only taken a few more steps for you to hop off. Now you found yourself lifted high in the air. Ryan's massive god-like face smiling before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Ryan opened wide for the next and final mouthful. The inside of his mouth glistening, almost as if it were a horrifying welcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOM\" Ryan brought his lips around the handle of the fork and pulled back slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavoring the sweet vanilla flavor on his tongue, he didn't even think to imagine that a once full-sized human was now desperately struggling for survival within his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing was unnecessary for the light and creamy consistency of the cake. He instead tilted his head back and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGULP <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried in horror as you felt your self being sent down the 12 year old's throat. A small bulge could be seen descending the boy's neck from the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~ Can I have Adam's slice?\" Ryan greedily reached over for the fourth piece of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take very long for you to hit is stomach where you were soaked in Ryan's acidy fluids. Your screams simply couldn't reach your friends as you were piled on by the remnants of the slice that had originally been for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the boys had begun searching for you, you had already been digested into a creamy soup. </span></div></div>",

As they continued to come, I could hear their bare footsteps getting closer. I had to hide. But I was too late. As they came in I just stood still not knowing on what to do. When I opened my eyes I say them to aknowledging my presence at all, as if I didn't exist. What was happening? I wanted to find out so I went closer to Cody his back was turned so I came up to ass. I never really noticed but my friends have really fat asses. Anyway I tapped his ass wit my finger but no response at all. Then all of a sudden Cody turned and his ass smacked my face hard. What the heck?! I shouldn't have hurt the much. Then Cody turned back again smacking my face with his ass the second time. Now I had really bad bruises on my face. But the the worst happened the guys started to play a game. For who could fart the best. I tried to run but Cody went first and he farted a huge fart right in my face. I was so disorientated that I staggered into the circle where all the guys met but instead of coming face to face with their front sides, I came into contact with their asses. Their fat butts were turned around to start the game. Then it happened. They all farted and I almost died it smelled horrible like rotten eggs and shit. Then Ryan lost his balance and fell on his butt. Right on my face. HOW COULD HE NOT FEEL ME! When he got up, instead of leaving me on the ground, his butt somehow managed to clench on to my face and keep it in his ass. So when he stood I was left dangling there as he continepued farting. It went on like this for 30 minutes! By the end I was suffering like their was no tomorrow. My lungs were almost finished off, the pungent smell almost made me black out. But it seemed I couldn't after that Ryan went back home and sat on his bed. My face was so far up in his ass. But as he sat down his hairy fat muscular ass seemed to swallow my whole body. Now even if you could see me I was now invisible to the outside world and trapped in his ass. I could see the shit and the smell of farts made me almost black out and throw up. I heard a deep rumbling and then heard Ryan say \"Uh Oh, got to take a shit, and a big one!\" He then ran into the bathroom, I felt his ass jiggle on every step. When he got there he sat down on the toilet. Do I slip out or stag in his ass</span></div></div>",

The I heard the door creak. Ryan dad was coming to shit! He had the biggest ass I had ever seen, when he said down, his gigantic ass could not even fit on the toilet seat<br>\r\n\"Oh man again???\" He said ass he squeezed his ass inside. It was so big and squeezed inside that it reached my face. He shat on me. But his butt was so close to my face that it managed to grab it and pull in out of the toilet as he was getting up. Now I was on the floor as he was pulling up his pants. Finally free of their asses! But my celebration was cut short when I smelled something cheesy. If was the mans size 22 feet. HUGE! They were so stinky I almost threw up. Then he stepped on my face and somehow still didn't feel me. His meAt toes were long enough to grab my face. I wad gagging as the smell hit my nostrils. Then his toes clenched around my neck and he started walking with me under his dirty sole. He went into his bedroom.he went on his bed. He started looking at porn and was getting hard. He let go if my neck and ripped his pants off. He kicked me into his  12 inch dick. Almost half my size! The dick started to beast me. Until I was black and blue. He then looked down right in my direction.</span></div></div>",

You were afraid that it was going to rain, which would have kinda made it a sucky holiday. Lady luck seemed to be on your side though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly walked down to the sidewalk, making your way towards the vacant lot where the four of you usually hung out. You couldn't help but smile as you stared up at the huge expansive sky over-head. Everything just seemed so perfect. Not even a cloud. In the distance you could hear the ice-cream truck making it's rounds as the smell of someone's barbecue prevailed the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making it to the lot, you noticed your three friends playing catch. The lot had been abandon for as long as any of you could remember. The aren't any sprinklers, so the grass only pops up in small patches across the large expanse of dirt. In a way, you kinda considered it your home away from home. People would probably assume that the four of you owned the property based on how much time you spent here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran up to your friends, excited to show them what you had discovered the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!' you greeted them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adam\" Brandon walked over and preformed a special handshake with you. Though none of you ever said it out loud, it was kinda assumed that you and Brandon were best friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys up to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just playing catch, you joining?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. sure but I kinda wanted to show you guys something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, common guys, I didn't come down here so we could waste the day away talking\" Ryan joined the conversation rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know, but I found this really cool-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see, Let me see!\" Cody ran over excitedly, not even aware of what 'it' actually was yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Cody, little kid much?\" Ryan jested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody's expression changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you always making fun of me?\" He clearly sounded annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I'll give you one guess\" Ryan spoke as he brought his hand down on Cody's head, ruffling his hair a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting Ryan's hand aside, Cody verbally growled in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks for proving my point. Very mature\" Ryan was clearly enjoying every moment of making the younger boy angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, eventually I'm gunna get taller! We'll see how easy it is for you to do that then.\" Cody seemed intent on holding his ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahhh, I don't think you're going to get a growth spurt. This is probably as tall as you'll get little guy. He reached again for the 10 year old's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP THAT!!!\" Cody pushed against he 12 year old's chest with his palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah woah, what's with the hostili-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT ENOUGH GUYS...\" Brandon ended the squabble quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody continued to glare at Ryan for a few moments before stomping off to backfield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are we going to play or not?\" Ryan rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waait! I want to show you something\" You didn't want to miss the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ryan and Brandon stood next to you as you reached into your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be good....\" Ryan groaned. Brandon knocked him lightly in the side with his elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check THIS out\" You opened your palm, releasing an indescribably bright light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W--WHAAHHH!!\" All three of you shouted in unison as the light seemed to consume you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His friends were gone. ........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T....they ditched me......\" For a moment, the boy's eyes began to water, but he roughly rubbed the moisture away with his sleeve in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J- JEEEEERKS!!!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he thought about chasing them, but he instead decided that he'd rather be alone then spend another moment around Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you or Brandon ever spoke up when Ryan was making fun of him. Probably because you two thought it was funny. The 10 year old bit his bottom lip in frustration as all these thoughts circulated around his mind. He began to tread across the vast lonely lot, alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was then that he noticed a nearby anthill. A grin formed across his boyish face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the brightness faded, the three of you stood there stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-..what was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your palm to find that the small meteorite had been turned to dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you turned around, standing back-to-back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you was a vast Savannah-type jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL\" Ryan yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Adam...what's going on!?\" Brandon shouted nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I don't know!!

A GIANT ANT?!?!\" Ryan was clearly freaking out at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... It's.. it's gotta be... a.. a bear or ..something\" You tired to hide the fact that it truly did look like a car-sized ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, three of you felt a rush of air behind you. You turned to see another ant had just raced by a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEY ARE ANTS. WHY...Wait....these aren't trees...are they...\" Brandon's voice started to get eerily quite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. no way..\" Ryan must have realized it too. The foliage that towered over us looked like giant blades of grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did we shrink?\" You spoke as your heart beat frantically in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look.. we ...we just need to stick together alright?\" Brandon tried to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we just wait it out, maybe we......\" His miniature speech is suddenly interrupted by a rhythmic vibration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D..do you feel that?\" The vibration begins getting more intense; In the distance you could hear a loud crunching noise that accompanied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stopped in front of the ant hill. He started down on it for a few moments watching the ants mindlessly enter and exit their hole. All he could think about was they way Ryan ruffled his hair and called him small. Fueled by anger and amusement, he brought his foot back and quickly swung it towards the small hill of dirt, causing it to explode. He watched as all the tiny ants began to scatter away in all directions. They knew that they were in danger, and Cody liked that. He was always too small to hold any kind of power over other humans, but with ants he was like a god. He slowly raised his foot over a party of ants trying to escape and brought it down with a quick crunch. He loved that feeling, that feeling of complete dominance and control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, the three friends heard a massive explosion, causing them to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!\" Ryan asked spontaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW SHOULD WE KNOW?!\" Brandon scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-guys... .. I think... we should run..\" You spoke fearfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?....!!!\" Ryan and Brandon's eyes went wide when they saw an army of ants running towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRUUUUNN!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends ran across the dirt covered terrain as if their lives depended on it. You would occasionally turn around, only to find that the ants were getting closer and closer. At this size, they were easily three times faster than you. Knowing that they were moments away from catching up the three of you screamed and covering your heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\nOpening your eyes nervously, you found that the ants were completely ignoring you. The just kept running right on past you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? Why are they not eating us?\" Ryan spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I don't think I want to question it..\" Brandon sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went silent as the vibrations started again. The grass above them quivered as the shaking only grew more and more violent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab on to each other\" Brandon yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you followed orders and linked each other's arms, getting as low to the ground as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was had to have only been three or four yards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the vibrations stopped, the sun suddenly disappeared......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening your eyes, you and your friends looked up nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of your jaws dropped. Towering high above the grass were two impossibly massive legs attached to a familiar pair of white shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-.....c..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above the shorts was a blue tee-shirt, followed by a god-like grinning face; but not just any face. It was Cody....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cody looked down at all the ants running across the field of dirt below him. He decided it wouldn't be any fun to just stomp them out while they clustered together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited a few more moments for them them to disperse before lifting his right foot in the air,  bringing it down hard on a single fleeing ant. This was followed by another stomp in a different location...followed by another..and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the boy's foot-falls snuffed out a life, while at the same time fulfilling his desire to be big and powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you watched in horror as Cody lifted his foot into the air; It was practically the size of a large building. The once shorter boy started to stomp into the grass not far away from you. You could tell by the look of intent on his face that his stomping had a purpose. You all knew EXACTLY what he was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need go get out of here!\" Brandon yelled as he pulled at both your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you ran for your lives. You never thought it was tasteful when Cody intentionally stepped on bugs, but now that you were the same size as an ant, your life was at risk. Each time you'd turn around, you would catch a glimpse of the bottom of Cody's sole, covered with the mangled corpses of ants. The scene made your stomach turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you felt that your group was starting to make distance, Cody began stomping in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding that he had taken care of most of the bugs that were in front of him, Cody turned around and noticed a few dozen ants running in a different direction. He licked his lips as he began to take care of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SQUISH\" Cody shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-guys! He's getting closer\" Ryan panted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SQUIIISSHHH!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to keep going! We just need ....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive stomp not far from you caused an earthquake strong enough to send you all to your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly a yard away was Cody's sneaker, pressed firmly into the dirt where you had just been running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Cody's eyes were now directly fixed onto your position. With no other ants in the vicinity, it seemed like you were the next target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-CODY!!!!!\" Brandon screamed, waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"Could Cody really notice us at this size?\") You thought to yourself. It was really your only hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ryan followed suit and began to yell up the giant boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody stopped for a moment when he noticed a group of three odd looking bugs between his feet. They weren't very dark like the regular ants, and they weren't running away either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nagging voice in the back of his head urged him to investigate the insects closer. Just as he was about to swat down and look at them up close, he suddenly remembered the reason he was so angry to begin with. Just thinking about those guys made him wanted to crush something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he looked down at the weird looking bugs, the more they reminded him of his 'friends'. The more he stared the more annoyed he became...until..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as if the world around them went quiet and time slowed as Cody's foot began to lift off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C........CODY...NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\" The three of you screamed as the gargantuan sneaker was slowly raised overhead; It's dark shadow swallowing the ant-sized boys. They now had a close look at the vastness of Cody's sole. It was almost disorienting to imagine that his foot size was the smallest of all four boys,...emphasis on WAS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of pure survival instinct, the three of you started to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody smiled as he finally got a reaction from the tiny insects. They were much slower than normal ants though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above the looming surface came closer and closer, the detail of Cody's treads becoming more and more visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE CODY !!! STOOOOOOP!!!\" Cody couldn't hear you. No one would ever hear you ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of rubber became apparent as the sole was now directly over your head. You knew that just beyond the rubber was Cody's socked foot. His toes likely twitching with anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COOOODDDDYYY-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young tween firmly pressed his foot down. None of the 'bugs' were able to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally feeling satisfied, Cody decided he'd had enough with ants today. Walking off, he didn't even notice the odd red colored blotches on the dirt where he had stepped. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
