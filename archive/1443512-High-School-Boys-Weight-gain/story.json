He looked for a place he could put his change when he was done but couldn't so he had to spend it all.  He ended up getting five hotdogs, 3 bowls of nachos drenched in cheese, and two two-pound hershey chocolate bars.<br>\r\n     He didn't want to ruin his body, but then he thought \"oh well, i probably worked this all off running my 100 meter dash.\" Then he started chowing down.  In less then 10 minutes, he was finished and the meet was over so he went home.  When he got back to his house his mom had dinner ready, which was actually just food from Mcdonald's. \"How's my runner?\" she asked as she handed him two big macs, two large fries, and two large sodas.<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is all mine?\" Warren asked.<br>\r\n\"Yep, now that your running, your gonna need a lot more food.\" his mom replied.  Warren agreed and so sat down to eat. again.  He quickly ate it, and then went upstairs.  He got undressed to take a shower, but then he noticed his bulging gut.  It was completely bloated from all of the food he ate that, which was enough to live off of for at least a week, he thought.</span></div></div>",

At the end of the week he got up as usual and walked to the bathroom to take a shower.  This time, however, he couldn't help but notice he felt a bit softer all around, and had a little bit of a stomach poking out.

Warren stripped down to his white boxer briefs, and bent down to find his shorts.  As he did this, 3 fat rolls piled up on his newly expanded waistline, while a jiggly butt stuck into the air.<br>\r\n       \"Your appeteite gettin to ya?\" said Jon while changing next to him.  Jon had always been skinny as well but his stomach was looking softer than normal.<br>\r\n       \"Looks like I'm not alone,\" Warren replied as he stood back up, revealing the beginnings of love handles barely pooching over his boxer briefs waistband.  Fat had gathered round his navel, sinking his belly button into his stomach.  Just then he pulled two snickers bars out of his gym bag, and ate them, while rubbing his new stomach. \"It's ok,\" thought Warren, \"I'll probably burn these off during practice.\"  His under armour shirt was a struggle to get on, and when he finally did, it showed every inch of chub on his body.  \"Oh well,\" he thought, \"It's probably just puberty.\"<br>\r\n        Coach yelled at them to go outside for their two lap warm up, and so everybody left the locker room.  During the warmup Warren's newly formed thicker thighs rubbed together, and his growing gut and small bubble butt bounced up and down, and by the end of the warmup, he was exhausted.<br>\r\n        \"Haha\" Coach yelled, \"Already packin' it on for wrestling season?  Keep it up!\"<br>\r\n   Warren wondered what this meant.  Did coach want him to get fatter?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He has a big spread of food on his desk. Warren stood there with his belly growling. He has a large subway sandwiitch, a plate of sweet potatos, meatloaf, turkey, dressing and ham. Warren was hungery, he hadnt eaten anything since breakfast. \" Now son thats good you packing on the weight but dont pack on too much...w- what ya looking at?\" The coach ask. \" Oh nothing sir, weeell...are you gonna eat that?\" Warren pointing at the plate full of food. \" Nah my wife made that you can have here sit take the load off eat.\" warren licked his plump lips, scoots a chair close to his desk and began to scarf the food down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done warren leaned back in the chair to catch his breath. the catch had been talking the whole time. he hadnt heard a word he said. \"You want the rest of this sandwitch?\" But he heard that. \"Yeah\" He straightens up and ingulf it into his mouth. They both get up, warren still holding the sandwitch in his mouth. the coach rubs and pats warrens soft jiggling belly. \" Alright get back out there.\" Warren mumbles ok and proceeds out the door.</span></div></div>",

Warren was clever at getting the better of his opponents and worked hard to learn the maneuvers.  He was exhauted after practice and still had to walk home.  He grabbed his bag and headed down the hall almost coliding with Carmen who lived down the street.<br>\r\n\"warren.\" she called, \"You trying to mow me down?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Carmen,\"  Warren stopped.  \"I was in a hurry.  I didn't see you.\"<br>\r\n\"That's no way to talk to a girl, Warren.  No girl wants to hear that she's not noticed.\"<br>\r\nThat comment stopped Warren cold.  Carmen was one of the hottest girls in class.  They had been friends since kindergarten but in High School, Carmen moved in a different world from Warren.  She ran with the A-list jocks and hot girls while Warren was just one more B-list jock.  Still they exchanged greetings from time to time.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Carmen.\"  he stammared.  \"I was focused on getting home.  I don't know why I didn't see you because you look great.\"<br>\r\nCarmen was good at putting boys off their stride.  Warren was fun to play around with but not really her type.  She looked at him.<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted.\"    Warren was looking different.  Damp from the shower with his hair slicked back his face was cute.  He did have some muscles these days and even more interesting a nice bulge over his belt.  <br>\r\n\"Want to</span></div></div>",

Now get going and feed it well.\u201d He says as he patted the swollen belly. Warren nodded again as he couldn\u2019t speak with a donut in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after practice and him getting a little exhausted. He went of to lunch. He then thought about the entire lesson. The coach didn\u2019t talked to anyone their when he talked to Warren. Maybe he missed it all when practicing.

On his rather thin frame, his potbelly protrudes out like a small basketball. It was soft and jiggly and he didnt tell anybody but it kinda hurts him when people poke at it. his lovehandles had gotten meatier and they oozed out the side of his suit. his belly made his back arch a little giving notice to his now big soft bubble butt. It was huge and his thighs are like big soft tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Warren is now the last one in the room,He's putting his clothes in his locker when his friend Jon walks in. \"Hey girl.

Warren just laughs. \" Hey man you think you got this? I saw ur opponent and hes big.\" Jon says. \" Dude look at me. all I gotta do is use my weight Ill be fine.\" warren says as he eats a snickers bar. They both walk out there.

Myers grabs his warrens left shoulder and with his other hand grabs under his crotch cupping some of his juicy soft booty meat.

He turned around to see his rear, his butt jiggling as he twisted around.  he had always had a nice round ass even when he was really skinny, but he could tell it had grown, perhaps more than his stomach.  His legs looked a little thicker too.  He hadnt realized he was putting on any weight at all, and it came as a shock to him.  Vince really didnt care, though-he needed to be bigger for hockey, and his dad seemed to approve of it too.<br>\r\nVince stepped on the scale, and watched as the needle rolled far past 130, and then snapped back to land on 147.  \"Woah!\" he thought.  He gained 17lbs of all fat probably in two months.  He'd never even put on that much weight in an entire year!  Maybe that was why all of his clothes had been hugging him pretty tight recently.  Putting them back on, it was pretty obvious to him now that he had put on a few.  \"I wonder if anyone else has noticed.\" vince said to himself.  They had to have, he thought, and he wondered why none of the guys on the hockey team had said anything.<br>\r\nVince ran back downstairs, his softened body jiggling a little with him.  \"Hey dad, is there any dessert? im starving.\" he said  \"yeah son, theres a carton of ice cream in the freezer, i'll go get you a spoon.\" his dad replied with a grin on his face.  The two talked as vince shoveled more and more ice cream in his mouth, completely oblivious to how much he was eating.  His dad tried to keep the conversation going on as long as possible so that vince would keep eating.  As vince neared the bottom of the carton, his dad grabbed a jar of homemade cookies and started nibbling on one.  Vince finished the carton \"man that was good.\"  without getting up, he tossed the carton into the trash and grabbed the jar of cookies.  his dad's face lit up, and they continued their conversation until vince finished his cookies. \"night, son.\" his dad said, proiud of how vince just ate, \"night dad,\" vince replied, lifting up his shirt and patting his stomach.  Rubbing his belly, vince went up to bed.</span></div></div>",

He then started to eat, making sure each bite he took was overflowing in his mouth.  with the help of his dad, he was quickly becoming a glutton.  vince dismissed this gluttony as a sacrifice for hockey, but he was beginning to enjoy it.  Getting food anytime he wanted it, and his dad giving him any junkfood he could ask for was a lifestyle he could live with.

He stripped down and tugged on some under armour boxer briefs, which were even tighter than normal.  Standing, he heard his stomach growl.  Lunch was only 1 and a half hours ago, but he wasnt able to go very long without having something in his mouth recently.  Vince reached into his backpack and pulled out a king size snickers bar.  he quickly unwrapped it and shoved it in his mouth, hoping none of his teammates would notice.

There were always other sports he could go for, but Vince had to admit to himself he didn't really feel motivated towards it. If anything, he just felt like doing exactly what he was at that very moment, chilling on the couch with some chips and a stupid reality show on TV. During the commercial break his Dad came in, holding up two dress shirts, one dark and the other light. \"Which one do you think I should wear tonight?\" he asked his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the occasion?\" Vince asked, surprised to see his dad dressing up, and more importantly making a big deal of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you didn't I? We're having dinner at my Boss's tonight. You should go get changed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince groaned, suddenly remembering his Dad telling him about the dinner. \"Can't I just stay behind and order take-out? It's going to be a bunch of adults and be sooo boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad frowned, \"Well, I can't make you go, but you know Buddy, it would mean a lot to me if you did. You know I've been working towards that new promotion for months now, and having you with me tonight to do the whole 'happy modern family thing' would really help seal the deal.\" His dad smiled, trying to be persuasive. \"And it won't be just a bunch of old farts like me, I know my boss has a kid about your age. Plus, I promise to let you have some booze if you try not to get drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince felt guilty now. He knew how badly his dad wanted the new job -it was all he ever talked about. And the promise of getting to drink was appealing. \"Go with the dark shirt. It won't show the stains if you accidentally spill something on it,\" he finally said, getting up to go change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks my man. Way to think like a bachelor,\" his dad said with a smile and a wink. \"I left you a new pair of dress pants upstairs,\" he added, pulling off the shirt he was already wearing to change right there in the living room. Vince paused for a moment on the stairs, checking out his dad's own growing gut. Although his dad had always been on the heavy side, his original paunch had definitely grown into quite a spare tire. 'Guess it must run in the family,' he mused, patting his own belly as he headed upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad's Boss lived on the newer side of town, in one of those houses that was just a fancy nameplate away from qualifying as a McMansion. It looked like the dinner party was already underway, with a few other cars parked out front. Vince's Dad introduced him to a few of his coworkers before they found his Boss. \"So glad you could make it!' he mused, giving them both a big handshake. A big guy, he was a bit ruddy faced and intoxicated when they arrived \"Your father tells me you're a hockey player, Vince. I played a bit myself back in the day. You any good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough, Sir,\" Vince answered politely, pretty sure the drunken man wasn't really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough, I like that,\" he laughed, patting Vince on the back heartily. \"Lemme introduce you to my kid so you'll have someone to hang out with tonight. Terry!\" He called across the room, and Vince saw someone make their way over to them. It turned out that Terry was...</span></div></div>",

He was so wide Vince had originally mistook him to be much older. He was carrying a plate loaded down with or-d'oeuvres and popping them into his mouth like they were M&amp;M's. \"Yeah, Dad?\" he asked, swallowing down a chicken skewer in two bites. Judging from the pile of wooden sticks on his plate, he must have already gone through half a dozen of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Vince,\" Vince's Dad's Boss said as he pushed Vince forward. \"I was thinking you two could hang out together tonight since we're going to be busy tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry looked Vince up and down, deciding whether or not to accept this offering. Vince tried to ignore the fact that Terry's eyes lingered longest on his small gut. \"Sure,\" he finally said with an approving nod. \"You like Madden? I got my Xbox set up in the next room.\" Vince nodded, grateful for there to be something for them to do besides make awkward conversation. He was beginning to suspect an ulterior motive to his dad bringing him along tonight. He was probably supposed to befriend this guy, thus helping his dad score big points with the boss. Maybe that was why he'd been encouraging Vince to eat more as well, so that he wouldn't look so damn skinny next to this mass of lard. The times just about lined up, his dad first mentioned the promotion he was going for about a month before he'd first suggested that Vince should bulk up for hockey. But, that couldn't be right, could it? Fattening up your kid just for a new job at a higher pay grade? It sounded absurd even in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to think about it, Vince focused instead on having a good time with Terry. And surprisingly enough, it seemed like they got along really well. Vince was good at sports games, but Terry was better, but just enough that they were a good challenge for one another. After the first few rounds they started talking, and before he knew it Vince felt like they were old friends. They were the same age and went to the same school, but Terry was smart and had skipped a grade, so they'd never shared a class or hung out before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vince and his dad finally left that evening, he and Terry had already agreed to check out the new action movie that was opening next week. As they drove away, Vince undid the button on his new dress pants and exhaled, letting his gut hang out. \"Those too tight on you Buddy? I thought I'd gotten the right size,\" his dad asked, eying his son's growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, they fit fine, I just ate too much tonight,\" Vince explained, rubbing his distended stomach contently. If there was one thing that was bad about hanging out with Terry, it was that it was really easy to get caught up in his pace of consumption. Vince had already started to feel full after the first hour together, but it was hard to turn away from the food with Terry there egging him on, so he'd just kept eating. It helped too that everything they'd served tonight was really good. It was no wonder Terry was as big as he is, if Vince could eat like that everyday he'd weigh twice as much as he did right now. \"Hey Dad,\" He called over, starting to ask...</span></div></div>",

Terry is a good kid and fun to be with.  I've never spent time with anyone that eats like that though.  With that and the fact that there was some pretty tasty chow over at your boss's place.  It made me think that when the good is good and some good friends, I could see myself getting fat.\"<br>\r\n\"Look son.\"  Dad told him. \"I'm not the best influence here but you're a pretty good hockey player.  No reason to give that up.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I see it that way too. Might be fun getting as big as Terry but the chicks like a jock, not a tub of lard.  It was just a thought.\"<br>\r\nDad shook his head.  \"Kids he thought to himself.  They have a hard time knowing what is important.  Being a jock with some serious abs was fine in school and when you are dating but things change when you get into the workforce,  Dad had found that his boss was taking him much more seriously now that he had packed on 25 pounds when hung softly over his belt.  He still hadn't locked in that promotion even with all the sucking up.  Maybe if he grew his belly bigger and more like the boss's he would be taken more seriously.<br>\r\nFalling asleep that night, Vince thought again about being really fat like Terry.  <br>\r\nHe finally decided that Dad was right.  Getting fat might be fun but being a hockey jock was better.<br>\r\nNext day at school</span></div></div>",

He was feeling especially hungry. He looked at all of the food that was layed out and spooned huge helpings of everything onto his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family was not surprised, as Alex always ate a lot because he used up so much energy on the sporting fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, everyone was paying no mind to Alex. Dad was telling a story about his day at the office while Mom was trying to talk her daughter out of wanting some expensive toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was eating the food, and it would be horrible if it went to waste, so Alex helped himself to seconds with even bigger helpings of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everyone was watching the TV in the other room, leaving Alex with the leftovers. Halfway through his fourth helping of chicken and mashed potatoes and vegetables, Alex felt too full to keep eating. But he shovelled in a few more bites anyway so not much food would be left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex found himself burping and hiccuping. His fullness made him groan and he clutched his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going upstairs,\" Alex announced. \"Homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family didn't pay much attention, as they were focused on watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sweetie,\" Mom said dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex got back up to his room, he didn't feel as bad. His belly was still full, but it didn't hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the bathroom and took off his shirt. He was surprised to see his tummy sticking out. It made him feel bigger and told him his weight problem must be progressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped on the scale and was shocked. It said he weighed 144 pounds, four pounds more than what he weighed before he ate. That was four more pounds to the ten pounds he had already gained. He reckoned this rise in weight was because of all the food he was carrying in his tummy. When he digested it all that night, he would be back to where he was the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he remembered the Geography assignment. He put his shirt back on and hurried to his room. Once he got to thinking, he understand just how to complete it. He recognized all of the land forms and mountain ranges in the textbook and was able to research and answer questions about them with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, he had completed his work. All five pages of Geography questions were answered. And it had been only a half hour. It was only 9:00. He figured he was so focused because of all the food he ate. It actually made him feel good, and may have sparked his brain. It was a lot better than being hungry, anyway. And less tiring than playing sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was feeling very good about himself. He imagined turning in his work early while his friends struggled to pass their classes. He went back to the bathroom to take a shower. When he emerged, he still found himself burping off his dinner. He poked out his belly of digesting food and looked at it in the mirror. He laughed at himself and found it funny he was letting himself go and that the stress was going with it. He dried himself off and got into his boxers and t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Alex had grown very tired. He had been laying in bed watching TV, when his mom poked her head into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some sleep, Alex,\" she said, \"Chara's wedding is at noon tomorrow, and I don't want you oversleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't\" Alex yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

He polished it off in no time at all and then started on a second. Before long he had wolfed down three bagels and was still feeling uncomfortably hungry. Rubbing his stomach absentmindedly, He went over to the pantry where he discovered some cookies and packaged cupcakes. He seized these hungrily and set to work devouring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe leaned back on the hind legs of his chair as he munched on a large creme filled cupcake, the chair creaking slightly as he did so. Alex belched slightly and munched away, on the cakes and cookies. A few moments later he reached into the box of cookies for yet another tasty snack, but his hand met nothing but the inside of the box. Alex frowned and looked inside only to find it was empty. Alex felt his stomach plummet and hurriedly looked over at the cupcake box. It too was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlex groaned. This was surely not going to help his wardrobe problem any. He looked down apprehensively at his belly and found that his fears had been confirmed. The waistband of his boxers has slipped beneath the widest part of his torso so that the front section of his waistband and a good inch or so of his lap was obscured by a large roll of soft, fleshy fat. His t-shirt was clinging tightly to every curve of his body, and was straining to cover all of his stomach. Several inches of it had already slipped free of the shirt\u2019s clutches and was hanging out for the world to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlex put a tentative hand on his stomach and patted it gently. It wiggled like jell-o beneath his fingers. He looked desperately around the kitchen at a loss for what do, wishing he could take back all the food he\u2019d just eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then, his mother entered the room, dressed in her pajamas. \u201cMorning Alex.\u201d She said sleepily, starting on a cup of coffee. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you dressed?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlex felt his cheeks glow red. \u201cWell, um, those clothes you put out didn\u2019t really fit, Mom.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

He had also begun to realize there were benefits to being so heavy, such as when he played football, it would be much harder for his opponents to bring him down. In fact, he decided not only would he join the football team in the next few months, but he would keep eating to improve his chance of making the team. Considering it was June, he could look forward to a summer of gorging on food with little else to do. Alex then went downstairs to the kitchen and made a pound of pasta with meatballs and proceeded to eat the entire pound. Sitting on the stool, the wood groaned as he ate, a occasional spot of sauce falling onto his belly. Swelling under the onslaught, Alex belly stuck out further and further. Finished with his meal, Alex let out a large belch. Getting up from the stool, he clutched his belly, but enjoyed the pain from being so full. Walking over to the fridge, Alex got out a bottle of Mountain Dew. \"Cant have a meal without washing it down\" he said out loud. Chugging it straight out of the bottle, he drank about half before his sister walked in. \"Alex, what are you doing?\" she asked. Puttting it down cheeks turning a bright shade of red he said \"I did not want to dirty a 'urrrrrrpppppp\" glass\". Patting his tummy, Alex let out another belch \"urrppppppppp\" that was a great meal. His sister, a look of disgust on her face said to him \"your such a pig Alex, and next time wear a shirt, no one wants to see your fat belly and hear you burp off your lunch. \"Shut up sis, just because your on an avocado and toast diet, does not mean that the rest of us have to\" his speech was punctured by another loud burp \"urrrrrrrppppp\" before he continued \"eat rabbit food. Leaving his sister with a frown on her face, Alex waddled out of the kitchen and went upstairs to get dressed for a pool party. Still burping off his lunch, Alex got out a pair of swimming trunks and he found that they could nearly close. </span></div></div>",

Taking off his shirt as he got ready to sit in a chair by the pool he felt a little afraid, no one from school had seen him with his new belly. As his shirt came off, Alex's belly hung out, and it was bigger then ever considering the pizza and soda he had just scarfed down. Grunting form sheer fullness, Alex laid down in the chair and looked at the pool with people in it. Suddenly his hair was pitched forward as two of his friends tried to throw him into the pool, but failed as they had not anticipated how heavy Alex had gotten. Instead, Alex fell onto the ground next to the pool with his friend James saying \"you need to lose a few pounds Alex, I had no idea you had gotten that heavy, but considering the size of your gut, I should have gotten a third person so they we could have your ass up into the pool. Alex pushed off the ground and stood up, his belly fat shaking both from his mothers and in anger at being dumped onto the ground.

Alex found an empty room and quickly dried himself off and began to change. His boxers were tighter then he recalled and then he found that his jeans could nearly button. With a almighty effort he closed the jeans and got his shirt on although it was skin tight. After leaving the room Alex went to the kitchen feeling hungry again from all the exertion. Alex noticed a large plate of cookies and brownies on the counter and just then his friend Jake walked in from the pool area. \"Hey Alex, I was getting hungry out there too! All of the swimming is exhausting.\" \"It sure is\" said Alex and both boys proceeded to make a plate of food. Jake was thin with abs but he kind of liked the look of a plump chubby Alex, and decided to challenge Alex to eat the entire plate and take six shots, having been aroused by seeing Alex's gut before and listening to him belch. \"Alex I bet you can't take six shots quickly and then eat this entire plate of desserts\" Alex said \"okay bet, and if I win, you have to get me two slices of pizza from the outside deck\" Jake could hardly believe his good luck, Alex was so stupid he thought and he was going to get to see a really stuffed Alex and her more of his sexy burps. Alex quickly took the shots, finishing the sixth one with a massive \"urrrrrrp\" that shook the room.Alex then began to shovel in the food as fast as possible, pausing only to rub his gut. Jake watched as Alex had the last brownie and said \"I win so get me that urpppppp pizza\" As Jake left Alex was feeling might proud of himself, but his pants were so tight and his belly was aching from the onslaught of food. Alex walked into the living room and sat down just as Jake came in and there was a massive bang as his button shot of his pants and smacked Jake in the leg.

Jenny went red. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's true!\" <br>\r\n\"Ok, Jen.\" <br>\r\nOllie looked at Jenny, who seemed hurt. \"Hey, Jen, why don't you come with me to that one party later this week?\" <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, at Dustin's house. He always throws good parties.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh, ok.\" <br>\r\nOllie waited impatiently all week for the party at Dustin's. He walked by Jenny's house the night of the party to walk her there. She came out dressed casually, as usual. Ollie had worn one of his button-up shirts over a t-shirt. <br>\r\n\"You look so cute,\" Jenny told him. He went red. \"Did you lose that burger weight?\" <br>\r\n\"Actually, no,\" Ollie admitted, grinning. He pulled up his shirt. Jenny stared, longingly. \"See?\" His belly was a bit rounded as opposed to its original flatness. <br>\r\nJenny smiled, mischievous. \"You should show everyone at the party how much you can fit in there.\" <br>\r\n\"Really?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" <br>\r\nAt the party, there was a lot of yummy food. Ollie was conservative about it, not wanting to stuff himself. Jenny encouraged him, though. Especially when she \"entered\" him into a challenge without his consent. \"Hey guys, Ollie's gonna eat all this if you don't get some now!\" <br>\r\n\"No I'm not,\" Ollie frowned. <br>\r\n\"Aww, come on,\" Jenny whined. <br>\r\n\"I can't eat EVERYTHING...\" <br>\r\n\"But you're the bottomless pit!\" <br>\r\n\"No, I--\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, OL-LIE, OL-LIE,\" she got everyone chanting. <br>\r\nEmbarrassed to be put on the spot, Ollie agreed to eat four whole apple pies. He was fine during the first pie, but towards the end of it he was starting to grow. By the third pie, his shirt was stretched over his gut, and when he finished the fourth, he took a deep breath and his button-up shirt popped open. Everyone was cheering and laughing with him about it. <br>\r\nOllie stepped on the scale the next morning and it said he weighed 170. \"Whoa!\" he recoiled, shocked. \"How the heck...\" <br>\r\nHe looked at himself in the mirror. His belly wasn't just small anymore, it was bigger, and when he touched it, it was soft and fat and felt kind of fun to play with. <br>\r\nA week later, after doing nothing but eating, going to school, and sitting around playing video games, Ollie's weight was up to 183. Thirteen pounds in one week! Now, when he raised his arms, his t-shirt came up and showed off his bellybutton, and he could eat an entire pizza easily. </span></div></div>",
