Burning debris and littered wires and shattered rocks...<br>\r\n\"Mama? Where are you?\"<br>\r\nYou take your first steps into this new world. You look around once more...And notice something incredibly horrifying. Some of the debris around you...They look like charcoaled bodies. And even worse...They look alike your body.<br>\r\n\"Brother? Sister? What's going on here? Mama! Where are you!?\"<br>\r\nYou call is left unanswered. You try and nuzzle one of the bodies...nothing.<br>\r\n\"Why are you all sleeping? Are you all...dead? Is mama dead too? Mama!\"<br>\r\nYou run around, calling for your parent, until you see a large suspension bridge. And on that suspension bridge...<br>\r\n\"...Mama...No...I...I'm all alone...\"<br>\r\nYou can feel it. Something wet coming out of your eyes, dripping down your muzzle. All you could do was run. Run away from everything you've just seen.<br>\r\n\"My brothers are dead...My sisters are dead...Mama is dead...Why?\"<br>\r\nYou run and run as far away from everything as you can. This is all you can do...for now.<br>\r\n\"Why are they all dead? Who did all this? Why is this happening to me!?\"<br>\r\nYou roar at the sky, hoping that everything will dissolve like a bad dream...Nothing. It starts raining now.

It wasn't really hate, the man took him for fishing trips, played rugby, did everything a son could ask for... but later as his power company really took off, and he started living in the fast lane, he wanted his son, him, living the life with him. That takes priority over David having a normal life apparently, it's like he became part of the company and started going on extravagant meetings with sweaty American businessmen to grand hotels, the food in particular hitting below the belt, David inherited the New Zealand appetite, a hungering desire for fish and chips... and that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the recent poor health of his father, and the recent poor practices of the company, David had been \"offered\" the chance to go to the U.S as a charity worker, a few smiling photos of a rebuilt house after that giant thing, the authorities were being quite hush-hush about just what had levelled the city, he had to jump a few checkpoints to get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to give up and call for the personal assistant that he swore he would never call (not after the bathroom incident), something about knee high barred into him, sending them both off a small muddy bank and nearly into a river. coughing and trying to wipe the gunk out his eyes, he grabbed onto what looked like a... wait what!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself up into a seated position, he stared into the eyes of what could only be described as a mini dinosaur, promptly looking away as it stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look into the eyes, its aggressive\"<br>\r\n\"Don't look into the eyes, its aggressive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt which point he dropped the damn thing as it yet out the most piercing yelp, right in his eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

David looked back at it as he stood up. \"Man, what are you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing started nibbling on his pants. David tried to shove it away from him and started walking up the bank. Suddenly, he felt something pulling his pants, which turned out to be the mini-dinosaur again. \"Ugh, if I give you some food, will you leave me alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing stopped nibbling on his pants and looked up at him. David just sighed as he went off to look for a restaurant, or some place with food. It took a little while, and lasted longer due to the creature nibbling on his pants again, but he finally found an abandoned restaurant and entered. The two headed towards the kitchen and David quickly took out a piece of meat and dropped it on the floor. \"There, eat that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing looked at the meat and quickly began eating it up. It looked at David again, making some kind of whining noise. \"You're still hungry? Alright, fine. Just give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid searched the kitchen and fed the thing whatever food he found. It wasn't long until it looked satisfied. David slumped onto the floor, very disgruntled at not just getting lost, but also getting stuck with this dino-thing. He knows that he's supposed to be here for charity work, but it's for people! Not Jurassic rejects like this thing! \"Ugh...I'm sure I'm gonna be stuck with you for a while...Well, I guess I have to call you something...But, what exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid closed his eyes and began to think. However, his train of thoughts were suddenly interrupted when the creature hopped up onto his lap and started settling in. David wasn't used to animals, but they were comfortable to spend company with. He just didn't expect to spend time with one so scaly. He cracked a little smile as he began rubbing the creature's back. He could feel very tiny bumps underneath the thing's scaly back. Was it gonna grow back spines in the future? Oh well. \"You know what, I'm just gonna call you Spiny. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpiny just yawned at him as it closed its eyes, lulling into a deep sleep. David felt tired from what he did to get into Manhattan. It was definitely a memorable experience, but right now, he just wanted to get some shut eye. He felt sleepy himself, closing his eyes as one hand was draped over Spiny's back...</span></div></div>",

You jumped over a piece of concrete and saw the docks, although you didn't know what docks were. All you knew was that there was water, where you must survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved quickly down a pier, relaxing as you breathed in the saltwater air. You were comforted, the shock of your family dead passing away, even as you thought of it. It didn't matter much anyway. As of now, you were genderless. You would need to become female to lay eggs of your own later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped into water, swimming away from the docks until you felt comfortable to stop. You then filled your lungs and dived, swimming down some 30 feet before stopping. You then swam forward, the land shrinking away until it disappeared. You slowly sank downward, hunger gnawing at you as you searched for fish. However, although your instincts said there were normally fish here, you found that you were the only one in the water. You could smell the fish(don't ask how), but they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they were frightened away by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt movement several feet beneath you, like something was following you. You spun around in the water, backing off as something rose upwards, as you saw the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of you was something huge, bigger than yourself, with a gray coloring that was almost indistinguishable from the water. It had fins on it's back and side, gills that opened and closed, eyes as black as the night, and a wide open mouth filled with serrated teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA word for this thing occured to you. A word from your instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed off as the shark swam towards you, it's mouth ready to tear you apart...</span></div></div>",

Evading the wet weather outside you dash into a nearby store and just stand in the door way, eyes trodding down and moping at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Glurgle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an emptiness in your stomach, fortunately it was big enough to distract you from that other emptiness of your life. You sniff around the discarded building, lots of boxes and jars adorn the shelves, each colorful looking but coated with a layer of dust and such. Suddenly a much more savoury smell enters your nostrils: MEAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking slowly to the source, your mouth waters as you see a large aisle of several packs of raw meat, almost as if it was set there to just be eaten by you. Greedily licking your chops you dig into one of the red, succulent pieces of muscle. Your teeth contact with something hard and stretchy, like a cover or something. You aggressively shred off the coating and chop down on the meal in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've eaten quite a bit, but while munching on the last bit of raw protein you figure you're not exactly alone. A small klink is heard like something being hit across the ground. With your fantastic sense of smell and hearing, you can pin-point the location of the mystery figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping out into the corner aisle you look onto </span></div></div>",

You're not entirely sure just where Bub is taking you, but he sure seems to know the way. You quietly follow him until the two of you reach a small building. You see various meat products through the window.<br>\r\n\"This is the meat vendor's store. I always come hear to beg for food when I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\nYou look inside and see all the tasty meat sitting in the shelves.<br>\r\n\"How do we get in?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Through the door, but I can't open it. It's over there.\"<br>\r\nBub points to the closed door at the side of the store. You look at the round thing sticking out of it and you grab it. You try pushing and pulling it, but it's no use.<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\nYou try ramming the door, which breaks off it's hinges and lands on the floor, glass shattering everywhere.<br>\r\n\"Wow. You're really strong!\" Bub says, looking up at you.<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\"<br>\r\nThe two of you begin eating the food inside. Bub gets full pretty quickly, but you still have room for more. You eat the steak on a table, the sausages hanging in front of the window, and the ribs sitting in a corner shelf. You plop down with a full belly, feeling a little sleepy from your meal.<br>\r\n\"Whoa...You sure eat a lot.\" Bub says, walking next to you.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" You say, looking at your distended belly.<br>\r\nYou yawn widely as you try to get comfortable on the floor.<br>\r\n\"It looks like the rain won't be stopping for while. I'm feeling tired myself.\"Bub says, huddling next to you.<br>\r\nBefore you know it, you're deep asleep, thinking about your new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Little G! Wake up!\"<br>\r\nYou open you eyes and stand up, looking around. You're still in the store...But something seems off.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Down here!\"<br>\r\nYou look down and see Bub, a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Bub, what is it?\" you ask. There's something off about him too.<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, it's just that, ah...\"<br>\r\nYou examine the store again, and finally notice what was off. When you two came in here, the shelves were a few inches bigger than you. But now, you can easily see right over them! You look down at Bub again and see him the size of your foot.<br>\r\n\"Bub, how did you get smaller? And how did the store shrink too?\"<br>\r\n\"It's not me, It's you! You grew bigger!\"<br>\r\nThat does make more sense when you look at it that way. But how did that even happen? You're taller by at least 1 feet!<br>\r\n\"Hey Little G...If the food here runs out, you're not gonna try to eat me, are you?\" Bub asks, taking a step back.<br>\r\n\"No! I would never do that! You've helped me out and keep me company, so why would I eat you?\" you say, leaning over to him.<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh good...And the rain's finally stopped too.\"<br>\r\nYou look out and see that he's right.<br>\r\n\"You never know when humans might decide to start coming back here again. We should probably get going now.\" Bub says.<br>\r\nThe two of you exit the store, you having to lean a bit to avoid the door frame.<br>\r\n\"Where should we go now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I remember a few more places we could look at.\" Bub says, walking towards a direction.</span></div></div>",

We're looking at mankind's displacement as the planet's superior race here.\" The camera moves back to Niko and Audrey.<br>\r\n\"We cannot let any of these lizards escape. So if the military is watching this, you must bomb the area as soon as possible.\" A loud thudding sound is heard in the background.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter what happens to us. What matters is to destroy this nest as soon as you can.\" More thudding sounds are heard in the background.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the emergency news everyone. This is Audrey Timmonds, signing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Little G?\"<br>\r\nYou don't hear him. You don't want to hear him at the moment. You stare at the blank screen for a long while before you feel your friend rubbing up against your leg.<br>\r\n\"Little G? I'm sorry I brought you here.\"<br>\r\n\"No...It's...You didn't know that...W-we'd find something like this here...\" You can already feel something dripping down your muzzle.<br>\r\nYou walk over to a corner, lying down and getting to a comfortable position.<br>\r\n\"The humans killed everyone...\" you say, still crying.<br>\r\nYou watch as Bub walks closer to you and licks off the tears staining your cheek.<br>\r\n\"It's okay. You'll always have me, and I'll never leave your side.\"<br>\r\n\"...Th-thank you, B-bub...\" You say, crying even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must've fallen asleep at one point, because you feel groggy as you open your eyes and see Bub beside you, eyes closed. As you get up, you wake him up as well. When he opens his eyes and sees you, his jaw drops.<br>\r\n\"Ah...Ah...\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What?\" you say.<br>\r\nAs you stand up, your head touches the ceiling. You look around you and find everything smaller than when you first came in here.<br>\r\n\"No way...I grew again!?\" you say, looking at the ceiling.<br>\r\n\"L-little G! Maybe we should get outta here before you outgrow the door!\"<br>\r\nYou agree as the two of you exit, having to lean down to fit through the door. In front of you is the cracked floor again. You're already getting a bad feeling from it.<br>\r\n\"Um...Maybe there's another way around it.\" Bub says, looking for one.<br>\r\nAfter failing to find one, you reluctantly go first. Several cracking sounds could be heard as you slowly make your way to the other side. When you reach it, Bub runs over to you. Then, that was when your heart stopped for just a second. In the very middle, the floor collapsed, with Bub right on top of it.<br>\r\n\"Gaaah!\" Bub screams, the floor giving way.<br>\r\n\"Bub!\"<br>\r\nYou rush to his side, jumping and grabbing him in your small arms. The two of you fall through the 3rd floor, hitting the 2nd, which gave way almost immediately. The two of you hit the 1st floor with a loud thud. Your body protected the dog from most of the damage, but now it's aching from all over.<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...Bub...\" you say, letting him go.<br>\r\n\"Little G! Are you okay? I'm so sorry!\" he says, nudging your head.<br>\r\n\"D-don't worry...You've seen the things my mom did, right? I'm much tougher than this...\"<br>\r\nYou try to stand up, leaning on a wall for support. When you can stand on your own again, Bub nervously looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can stand on your own? We should just get outta here before the whole place goes down!\"<br>\r\n\"H-hey now, we came here for shelter, right? We might still find something here...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...\"<br>\r\n\"Look, if things get too dangerous, we'll leave as fast as we can. alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...alright then. Let's go Little G!\"</span></div></div>",

There are egg shells surrounding you all, with a large hole at the very center.<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" you ask, looking around.<br>\r\n\"This used to be the place where all those humans played their games. Believe it or not, but I've been here a few times myself!\" Bub said, strutting in front of you.<br>\r\nYou look around a bit more until you find your own broken egg shell, underneath a few broken columns.<br>\r\n\"Hey! I think this is where I was born!\" you say, rushing over to it.<br>\r\n\"Really? Looks a bit small for now.\" Bub says, looking at it.<br>\r\n\"Wow, I really am growing a lot, huh? I wonder if I can still fit in this...\"<br>\r\nYou carefully step inside the egg and try to fit your body inside. After a few attempts, your foot and tail bursts out of it, creating new holes in the shells.<br>\r\n\"Definitely not.\" Bub says, inspecting the other shells as you step out of yours.<br>\r\n\"It smells like fish and smoke around here.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Do you like fish?\" Bub asks.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do. But I haven't tasted it yet, though.\"<br>\r\n\"How could you like something you've never tasted yet?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Maybe it's just something I'm born with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of looking at your siblings' egg shells, the two of you decide to inspect the large hole at the center.<br>\r\n\"What do you think is in there?\" Bub says.<br>\r\n\"I dunno, but I can smell more fish down there!\"<br>\r\nThe two of you discuss what to do next. After a few minutes of going over the pros and cons of this, you both decide to explore the tunnel after all. Bub jumps up into your arms, and you hold him close.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n\"Ready.\"<br>\r\nYou jump down the hole, plummeting into darkness...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ever seen the American 1998 Godzilla movie? Well...Remember the egg that hatches at the end of the film? Ever wondered what happens to that last Godzilla child? I think it's about time we see the world from its point of view of the world. Taking place right from where the film ended, we get to be in its shoes. Look for shelter and avoid contact with humans. Find food in dumpsters or scattered boxes, or even eat a stray animal right off the street. Survive long enough and grow bigger. You must take up your parent's legacy...Even if it means accepting help from a few humans who seem to understand you more than you realize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can decide what path Little Godzilla (or Little G if you want) will take in his quest for survival in Manhattan. You can even put in absolutely no human encounters if you want, and he must grow whenever he sleeps by just a few feet. If he does have to encounter humans, please try not to get him killed. If he's accepting help from anyone, make sure to add a name so Little G can remember them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-He can talk to animals<br>\r\n-No killing off characters<br>\r\n-Minimize cursing<br>\r\n-No mature content<br>\r\n-Little G must be growing only when asleep, every time he sleeps, and it should be realistic and not instantaneous<br>\r\n-Helpful humans may or may not stay with him or allow him into their homes<br>\r\n-Remember that he's actually rather intelligent, even though he's newly hatched<br>\r\n-Vore is acceptable only when needed, and only with stray animals, no humans<br>\r\n-Try your best to make him as gender neutral as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd remember, have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: For anyone who saw the cartoon series, which is supposedly a direct sequel to the American movie remake, let's just say that the events here happen on a completely alternate timeline/reality, so as not to confuse people who watch the show.</td>",
