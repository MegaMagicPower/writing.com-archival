As the two looked through, the sassy blond Sarah, and Matt's sister Jane played ball out front and called to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't you knuckleheads bored of looking yet? There's nothing but dusty lamps and old knick knacks in there.\" Sarah said. Sarah wasn't particularly as close to the boys, but she was close friends with Jane so tended to spend time with them by association.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they'll find some sort of Genie.\" Jane joked to herself, her short dark hair shining in the sun as she wiped the sweat off her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Brandon scavenged through item after item, all fascinating treasures to them. But, they too tired out and got bored with everything each the same after awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beat. Let's go back inside, I'm sure my mom has made us lunch by now.\" Matt told Brandon, tired from digging and his hands quite dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll met you up in a little bit.\" Brandon said. They bumped fist and went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Brandon thought he'd go through one more container. It was a dusty case with a silver plating and multi-colored band decorating the handle. He struggled to get it open, but after prying it with a wrench a series of dark coins and colorful gems rained out. He'd be rich! Just fantasying about all the things he could buy with the jewels, Brandon started picking up them up one by one, when a stray artifact had fallen into the corner. Peaking underneath a table to get it, it was different than the others. Ruby red, it was a ring that slipped right around his finger. It glowed a ghastly red haze, and Brandon suspected without a doubt it was magic of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat! I wonder what this thing can do.\" Suddenly with those words, it grew hot and pulsed a steaming red as if on a stove, yet it didn't hurt the boy at all. Instead he heard a cryptic voice inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If another familiar ye wish to seek, give it a wish and a knock and into you they shall peak!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Familiar? Like a friend or relative?\" Brandon thought. This must be able to summon forth creatures or help he guessed, of some kind. He thought of all the cool fictional characters that maybe he could try out, but familiar should be someone he was close to right? Without delay, he announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"I wish Matt's Sister Jane was right here now!\" </div></span></div></div>",

It had glowed a hot red for a moment, but than faded back to it's dull Ruby colored shade. He shook it a bit, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, what a ripoff. Still, I guess it's a neat ring.\" Brandon lamented, as a rustling sound was heard upfront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun in here?\" A voice echoed. It was Sarah, her blond hair, white camisole and pink skirt standing out in the grimy darkness of the Garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finishing up.\" Brandon told her. He dusted himself off and started to make his way out, basking in the sun again as Jane waved aswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Jane continued to pass their ball back and forth and bantered with him. \"So, did you find anything interesting? A magic genie, or hole to the mole people perhaps?\" Jane joked, giving her girlish chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother's best friend only shrugged. \"Nah, nothing too great. There were some mint coins but they're probably worth dirt. But atleast I got this cool ring though,\" Sarah caught the ball and the two girls stopped and looked over. Indeed there was a gleaming red Jewel on top a lavish ring on Brandon's finger. They both Oooo'd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's supposedly magic or something, since it was speaking earlier. But it just as well could be a cheap toy or something, that lights up and makes noises. I don't know.\" He shook it slightly and it glowed a pale red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Sarah poked it rather curiously. \"That could be, but I've never heard of a glowing ring like this, and plus this thing looks ancient. They wouldn't have the technology for that whenever this thingy was made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shucks, It being magic certainly sounds interesting. What does it do exactly?\" Jane asked, poking Brandon on the forehead while raising her other pointer against her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, while it supposedly summons 'Familiars' I think, or seeks them or gives them a peak? I don't know, the voice was pretty vague.\" Brandon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Familiars, you mean like a witch?\" Sarah posited. \"Yeah, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon scratched his head, while Jane shook his hand staring curiously with the ring. \"Goody! That sounds just cool enough to be fascinating! Let's give it a try.\" She said, grasping it with her hand.</span></div></div>",

We don't know if this ring really works, but even if it does that sounds pretty dangerous. Most witches are generally evil, and even if not by intention, they tend to be malevolent just be nature.\" Brandon tried to inform her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmhm, do you know how many times Sabrina screwed everything up just by trying to make things better for her with magic? It's a risky business.\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane wasn't listening to any of that. She plucked the ring off and held it towards the sun. She didn't know about any magic shops or generic Witch sitcoms, but she'd read plenty of storybooks and seen too many movies and cartoons to not be excited about the prospects of meeting a witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the ring would summon her a familiar? Or maybe it would turn HER into a witch and give her familiar, along with magic. She remembered she loved Disney, there were loads of witches there. Holding it up closely, she began to rub her fingers against it, knocking it against her elbows while she rubbed, and as per her fantasy, a mist emitted out. The ring had been activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, wait don't! NO-\" Sarah rushed to Jane's safety and clasped her hands around the ring. It immediately exploded in a gushing stream and colorful vapor. Just seconds prior, Jane had fantasized and wished about meeting...  </span></div></div>",

Jane had been pushed back in the midst of the trauma and now Sarah had been paying the price. \"Guys! Mmmmp..Helmmp Mmm!\" She struggled, with the liquid quickly finding itself coating her arms and legs, expanding outwards and completely coating her body. Before she could muster another word, it had covered her mouth and head and blinded her vision completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and her friend Brandon could only look look in horror as the goo coated her, but luckily only for so long. The mist grew thicker and eventually covered all sight of their sassy and responsible Sarah, who was only trying to prevent Jane from making a bad choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to bode well for her however. Sarah could hardly regret it, her mind was in a haze as she felt like she was floating, almost in the air or in water, being scrubbed by a thousand tiny bubbles. She'd lost track of her limbs and senses were amiss, and when they finally began to return they came back stronger and more keen to her than she'd ever known. The mist finally faded, and Sarah felt dry and conscious once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's face lit up like the forth of July while Brandon jumped behind her, confused and terrified at what was in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, you're...you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what happened?\" Sarah asked, confused and unable to see anything different with her appearance, now resembling a slightly-shrunken Ursula. On one of her human fingers was the Ruby red ring, slowly fading out of it's bright red color and ceasing to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Jane finished, oblivious to all the horror of what had happened, except through her blissful mind thrilled to see the ring worked.</span></div></div>",

I don't know, that sounds a little..\" Sarah twaddled her thumbs, a little nervous at the idea. It could be rather dangerous to bring forth a live superpowered being into this world, assuming the ring worked as they were suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see a problem with it. As long as we bring in a super HERO, and not a villain into the picture. Why not pretend a bit?\" Brandon took off his ring and handed it to Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeah see, Brandon's cool like that. He knows it won't do any harm, plus who hasn't wanted to see a real life Superhero?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane positively bustled with excitement. She slipped the ring giddily onto her finger and raised it up, shimmering the sunlight across it's red jeweled surface. She could hardly wait to bring forth her favorite comic superheros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who should we even summon?\" Brandon asked.

Let's summon Batgirl!\" She said, thrilled at the prospect of meeting her favorite superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Batgirl eh? Sounds sort of like an odd choice, but I guess we can try it.\" Brandon agreed. A cloud moved over the sun slightly, and the wind bristled by but otherwise it was mostly silent in their sturdy neighborhood. Matt hadn't come back yet, and he was sure his mom was busy inside anyway. They'd be bored the next few hours if nothing else, so he figured they may as well give it a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, do you know how to use it? I think you just have to think real hard of the character you love and shake the ring up abit, or something. I don't really know if it works, but that's how I figure it would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded her head and posed sensationally. With a deep breath, she thought hard about batgirl. Her looks and voice, her physical abilities and brave charisma, all the bat-gadgets and skills she honed. With her unshakable determination, as strong as Batgirls herself, to bring forth this wish she shook the ring a bit, and mustered all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Batgirl was here right now!\" Jane shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that instant, the ring glowed red hot and vibrated. Jane wasn't hurt, but she did feel a cool tingling sensation running up her hand, and than arm. The ring let out a brightly colored gassy mist of vapor and started spraying a gooey liquid all over her, which started spreading up and down her body. Her two friend both panicked, but before they could even reach her the steam had obscured her completely. </span></div></div>",

She felt the sensation on her hand and arms, creeping and tightening against her waist and thighs. Finally it coated her head and feet, and although she couldn't see anything, she felt like something was being poured or wrapped onto her. It made her rather light headed, although she retained her conscious awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to her senses, slowly but surely the colored vapor released from the ring faded. Her vision returned and she could feel her poise and awareness returning. The clouded sky came back into view, and soon her neighborhood was visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything settled and cleared, her two friends, Sarah and Brandon simply stood in shock. Sarah was covering her mouth pointing, and Brandon just scratched his head, not sure what to make of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is Batgirl here? Where is she.\" Jane looked around frantically. \"Don't see her\" She held up her arm, covered in tight sewn leather. \"Ring must be dumb prop.\" She declared in disappointment. She put a gloved hand on her hip and another in her mouth, biting the leather slightly across her masked face, which extended into a hood with two pointy bat ears per any proper Batgirls costume. Her body was was encased in the same shiny, yet sowed up leather black fabric that made up the rest of her new costume, that being a form-fitting bodysuit that seemed more agile on a ninja or crime fighter than it did a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. So hot.\" She said, pulling off the mask and revealing her sweaty face underneath. It was drastically different, taking up slight oriental features and sharper looks. Her messy black hair was shorter, and even darker than before. Her bodily physique was slimmer, and seemingly more fit. A utility belt latched around her lower waist with a handful of bat-gadgets with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? See something?\" Jane said, breathy yet precise. She seemed a bit more stern, like some bit of life or youth had just been taken out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sucked. Let's go.\" But when she smiled briskly like Jane did, the same old dazzling Jane shone through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the red ring on her finger, and thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

There's no way she would've neglected to mention this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes to Touhou, the strange thing about the characters is that, because the art neglects things like how old the characters look and proportions, each character could have any sort of appearance, and each one differs from artist to artist. Brandon was curious as to see what the \"canon\" or \"human\" version of Yukari Yakumo would look like. \"I'm gonna need a mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah immediately went through the piles of stuff in the garage. \"Hold on, I think that my old room had a full-body mirror. Ah, here we go.\" She pulls out said mirror, and places it in front of Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gives himself a once-over. His new body, like he would've assumed based on the character, looks like either an incredibly youthful and sexy 30-year-old or an incredibly sexy and mature looking 20-year-old. He (<i>'She,'</i> he corrected mentally. <i>'There's no way I can think of this body as male.'</i>) had red eyes, long blonde hair with two red ribbons tied on the end of either side of it. She had a long purple dress with a generous amount of cleavage and purple heels that she could tell from the crisscross design were going to be <i>horrible</i> to get off. But there were two things that popped out more than anything else on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the breasts. As is normal for every fanservice-y anime girl, there was absolutely no way that any pair of breasts would be as large and as perky without either serious surgery or magic. But he didn't even feel any back pain in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, the frills. Oh dear lord the frills. They were on EVERYTHING he was wearing, from the mob cap to dress to even the socks (stockings? They'd be weird version of either one).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I want to change out of this as soon as possible. I can't live with all of these frills on everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah said \"I think that there's some old clothes in my mom's room. But anyway, how are you feeling? Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pursed his lips. \"I feel... smarter. Way smarter. I want to simultaneously play the greatest prank in history and figure out cold fusion. And I feel <b>strong</b>. Like I could do anything if I put my mind to it, but I'm also too lazy to actually do anything important. All of which are things that Yukari does. But I also can feel that those are sort of... minor compared to my \"real\" personality? I don't know. Yukari's a very powerful character in Touhou, so she may just naturally be more observant and have more insight into things than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let out a breath, seeming a lot less tense than before. \"Okay, so at least it isn't too major. So we know that, at least for us, our personalities will be at least mostly intact. Now we just have to observe Jane for a bit to see if she's under the same kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if saying her name summoned her, Jane opened the door. \"Hey, are you guys done in here yet? Dinner's almost ready, and...\"</span></div></div>",

But the idea of Jessica Rabbit just appearing before them out in their parking garage was almost too funny to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring glowed a scarlet red and shook slightly. \"It's working! Do it again!\" Jane suggested, shaking it slightly and pressing it against her other palm as if shaking a soda can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Jessica Rabbit was here already!\" He repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane continued shaking as hard as she could and gave herself a laudable swing to her cut in a typical egregious fashion, making \"Boom\" and other sound effects with her voice as she did. Finally the ring started vibrating and glowed red hot. It didn't burn Jane at all, but a thick liquid began to spray out, quickly covering Jane's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agggggh what's happening?!?\" Jane shouted. Steam poured out of it immediately spraying Jane in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Brandon panicked and rushed to remove the ring, but it wouldn't pull off and was rather hot for them, forcing them back with slight aversion to the burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could do nothing but watch as the liquid continued to pour, shifting a gooey red, purple and whitish-cream color as it poured onto Jane's body. It was quickly eloping her like a large blob of melted fondue, and practically down to her knees when she vanished from sight. The thick steam basked her, and grew thick enough to obscure her two friends vision. Jane herself felt somewhat lightheaded, but strangely enough her vision and control were starting to return, and the warm vapor of the steam cooled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it started to fade, Sarah and Brandon could only stare in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G..guys? Am I okay, Darlings?\" A sensual and smooth voice cooed, as a much older women came out of the clearing mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane? Is that you?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is Darling. That was sure some scare huh, I ain't seen nothing like it.\" The new 'Jane' said. Replacing her young adorkable appearance, was now one identical to that of  a slightly Modified Jessica Rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt Jane now seemed older, although as \"Jessica\" the character seemed younger. Her hair was a ginger shade, sporting Jessica's fabulous curvy bangs in front of her hair, although it was still significantly short in the back, even if more wavy. Her frumpy blouse was fused with a rubbery red fabric that meshed into a long dress, the trademark one Jessica Rabbit wore. She had one short purple opera glove, and an arm-length one that Jessica wore. Her face was made up with full red lips, blue eyeshadow, and makeup that basically gave her the face of the saucy cartoon character, but on Jane's head, or slightly altered head. Two red heels decorated her feet, with her legs extended out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane had become a miniature Jessica Rabbit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon and Sarah stood, eyes wide open and unable to believe what they had just seen. \"Jane\", as she either 'now' referred to herself as, or still did simply swung her hips sexily and posed herself towards them. \"What's wrong? That nasty O' ring didn't mess up my beautiful face, now did it? Ah shucks, just my luck. What a gobblestopper that doozy was\" She said, raising her arm atop her head and staring out dreamily as if posing for a camera, before snapping out of it as if realizing she was out of character. (For Jessica Rabbit that is)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, although still freaked out simply said. \"S..sure.\" She passed the ball to Jane, who caught it barely as always. Jane was naturally sporty, but ironically not too athletic owing to her stature. With her skinnier but dainty body and mannerisms, she caught it with even less grace than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked once more at the ring in her possession as they awkwardly resumed their game of catch.

How had such a mere ring been given the powerful to transform someone so drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon thought about taking the ring off her, but against his better judgement, and curiosity, he didn't. Sure maybe she might transform back, but whose to say he might not accidentally make it permanent? It was too risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could do was watch the new Jane, flutter her eyes and pose sexily while still oddly, playing the role of the old Jane. She caught and passed the ball as before. She skipped and fluttered as his friend always did. When she missed it one time, she made a familiar quip about it. It wasn't just like she was merely replaced by Jessica Rabbit, it was like Jessica Rabbit had 'replaced her' in a way, and was now trying to play and act out the role of Jane as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was mostly successful, the weirdly feminine and sometimes sexual way she sometimes did it certainly seemed at odd with Jane's normal charm. When she tripped in one instance, rather than over-reacting and dramatically joking like Jane always did, she cooed and lamented like a Hollywood star on a set, not in a silly friendly Janey fashion but in a sensual Jessica one.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that which reminded Brandon that Jessica was really just a \"Character\" of sorts, a fictional one and a cartoon at that. She wasn't a real actor or movie star or anything, how would anybody expect her to act playing a dorky young teen? She seemingly now Jessica Rabbit's had personality and mindset, but still had to act as herself, so her trying to stay as Jane seemed a bit conflicting. Also, she didn't see any of this just as terribly weird as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the three heard a call nearby.</span></div></div>",

My...shoelaces are untied.\" She said, before leaning down and noticing sparkly red pumps. \"Woops, I guess I don't have shoelaces. I can be so forgetful at times darling.\" Sarah was about to bank on that. It seemed like a failing at first, but hadn't she noticed now that her shoes were different? She remembered that her previous dressy flats didn't have laces, but maybe it was something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should go in now. It sure is a shame that the magic ring didn't work. Let's try this sweet little gem anytime.\" She said in Jessica Rabbits voice, swaying her hips as she walked inside, before falling to Jane's norm again and tripping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should be more careful sister.\" Her brother Matt said, helping her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Matty darling!\" Jane was beaming.</span></div></div>",

Where'd you get it exactly?\" Matt asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed it around and nuzzled it on her cheek. \"Oh, this little old thing? It was a gift from Brandon, found in our old garage I suppose. Apparently it's magic but, we haven't really figured out how to use it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah watching nearby tapped her foot nervously. How was it that Jane couldn't realize how different she looked, and how she'd just transformed into Jessica Rabbit? Was the person in front of her even still Jane? She was certainly acting like it, or trying atleast. She did seem a little different appearance aside, maybe it was making her think and act like Jessica? No, Jessica Rabbit was some slinky cartoon bombshell who lived for the stage and her trademark gloves and red dress. She wouldn't be caught dead just playing ball or talking to her 'Brother' suddenly, but Sarah couldn't help but notice some of the same dainty mannerism were there. While she clearly thought she was Jane, she wasn't always acting like it. Acting very well anyway, not to insult her long time friend but how hard would someone really have being Jane?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, Jane and Matt were talking about the rings themselves Sarah noted. \"Wait, what are you guys doing! Be careful with that, you don't know what it's capable of!\" she shouted, trying to prevent another strange mishap like what had happened to the young teenage girl that use to be Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duhhh, it clearly didn't work before. But that's why we have to try it again Sarah! So we can meet familiars or whatever. Don't be such a worry-wart toots\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane seems to trust in it, so I'm cool with it. At worst it probably won't even work, but who know?\" Her brother Matt suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah clenched her hands, but Jane was already anxious to try it. She shook her hands and swung her arms in unusual poses and indirectly triggered the ring. With a sensual melodic voice, she said, \"I wish we could bring forth..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She fluttered about frantically, cooing and ahh'ing, worried that she'd stubbed her toe or broke a nail, complaining in a dramatic and yet overdone and rather silly fashion, making the Unwieldy and gawkish charm of Jane mesh weirdly with Jessica Rabbits usual starlet self. It was like watching Jessica Rabbit herself suddenly lose everything that made her, her, and instead given the mind (and stature) of a dorky young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay guys, really. Just fumbled was all sweeties.\" She assured her friends. Sarah clenched her first and hastily made her way up to Jane, having had quite enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah wait, don't!\" Brandon shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late, she'd reached over Jane's dainty and slick gloved hand and plucked off the ring. \"Enough of this already, I've got to fix this. This is just getting ridiculous.\" She announced, as she placed it on her own finger. \"Now how does this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon tried to prevent another mishap and the take the ring off himself, but Sarah held tight to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-..err doing.

What were those two doing, and why were they wrestling over some silly ring? Jane walked behind him and put her gloved arms sensually around his back, nuzzling him somewhat before being called back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the darn devil are you two doing now? We tried this, the ring didn't work you silly squirts.\" She announced, sighing and hoping she could break them apart. As she did, their confrontation pushed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Jane I'm trying to help!\" While they were struggling for the ring, they had shaken it immensely.

She screamed a high-pitched squeal before the ring's effect took hold, it's quickly foaming steam and liquid covering her mouth and body with a fleshy colored liquid that she couldn't escape or avoid with the ring on her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! I'm so sorry, just, just hold on!\" Brandon said, trying to reach in and save her, only to retract his hands from the steaming hot meld that was erupting out. He didn't manage to remove the ring, but interestingly much of the residue had clobbered and soaked onto his hands. It spread and coated them, but ultimately stopped somewhere midway across his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was left was distinctly slimmer and more feminine, rather attributable to Jane. He hardly worried about it at the moment, because Sarah's changes were distressingly more extreme. When the steam cleared and gooey liquid that had spun out over her finally cooled and dried, what was left in the kids sight was a completely identical copy of Jane, made out of what was previously Sarah. Covering her eyes, she finally opened them, and gave a huge sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god. It didn't work or change me, I'm still me.\" Sarah exclaimed. However her content expression changed when she saw that of the others, staring at Jane, Brandon and Matt staring surprised back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..what happened to you? Why do you look like my sister? Did you become..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" Jane shouted interrupting Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, and that is to say 'Jane's' face looked like I'd just been hit by a truck. Wide eyed and horrified, she suddenly had realized what'd happened. After Jane's transformation into a Janeified Jessica Rabbit and yet obliviousness she could only put together the strange fate that had befallen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh god. Holy shucks, I look like Jane  now, somehow don't I?\" Sarah said. Despite not being able to perceive or see it, she could clearly reason that this was to be true.

She cooed and attempted to chuckle, but it came out more sensual than Jane's usual amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. You've been acting a little more like her to, or well, it's kind of like your her and she's trying to act like you to be honest. To varying degrees.\" Sarah explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane felt about her body groped herself slightly. Her shiny opera gloves, her dress, her new cleavage. She felt slightly enticed, but at the same time let down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do see what you mean doll. I can sort of, feel myself and it is different, very different. I'm clearly different or feel very different, but whenever I try to think of myself as Jessica Rabbit, or see myself all that comes up is this idea of this girl known as Jane, plain old Jane. No offense.\" She told Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\" Sarah snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what was that?\" Matt raised an eye and cocked a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's what?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just.. the two of you sorta, well you pointed out or acted like you weren't yourselves. The way you just referred to my sister and you was like, you treated them like separate people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I? Oh myyy.\" Jane said. \"Oh your right. What am I talking about, 'No Offense'? I am Jane, or atleast definitely think of myself as her. Why did I saw it like that, this situations stickier than honeycakes on sausages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trepidation! Truly a conundrum.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane crackled. \"You know that's not how I usually talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. I guess since I've known her, you assuming and all, maybe that's how I imagined it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had a laugh and carried it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really laugh like that?\" Jane asked giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't help but dabble in the humor as well. \"No, well maybe? Technically this is me, that being you as Jane trying to intimate my laugh. It's like asking you as your normal Jane self to mimic me.\" She unforcibly carried on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd do a better job at that.\" Her friend insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can try later. If you tried now, I'd be Jessica Rabbit speaking, and trying to be Jane making her bad impression of me.\" The two burst into laughter, actually finding it kind of silly once they got around the strangeness of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, enough of this. This is ridiculous. Let's just try fixing all this. Brandon suggested, taking off Sarah's ring and offered it to Jane. \"Look, this should be simple. If it transformed you into these characters and different people, all that should be required was a wish to turn back right? Just say something like, 'I wish to be Jane' and it should go smoothly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls thought about it for a moment, and agreed. Jane bit her glove off, although to her perspective she was merely putting her finger on her chin. \"Yes, let's.\" She put out her hand and Brandon placed the ring on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been fun, but I think I'd like to be perfectly truly me again darlings, instead of just a different person thinking I'm me and pretending I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt rolled his eyes, and hoped nervously that this would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane posed flatteringly like Jessica Rabbit might, and dangled the ring in front of her provocatively.<br>\r\n\"Make me Jane again, fully Jane.\" She demanded.</span></div></div>",

She than skipped while trying to perform an odd swaying with her hips and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at Brandon again. 'Did their mother notice?' was a question heavy on both their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pointed to her pointer finger silently and pretended to slip off a ring, nudging her head towards the vastly changed Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon merely shook his head and swiped his arms, trying to persuade the action off. Sarah grumbled and started to join Jane inside, with Brandon only shrugging and leaving the pavement. Soon after they were in the kitchen where a table of sandwiches and sodas were laid out on the table. The two sat down, while Jane took her time trying to sensually place herself on a seat, crossing her legs with slight discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began to eat, the two could only shiver as they saw Jane, in her new body attempt to act as usual but so still came off so differently. When she ate her sandwich, it was sloppy and weird the way she engorged it, but more than usual. Because rather than it being Jane's usual appetite, it was Jessica Rabbit trying to imitate Jane eating, with crude results. They even saw her sort of shiver up repulsed herself, showing even she couldn't handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know darlings, maybe I'm not that hungry afterall.\" Jane said, washing it down with a coke anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried to reach her hand over Jane's dainty gloved hand and snatch the ring slowly, but Brandon slapped her quickly much to her dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother door swung open.

Normally he'd be fine to see him, but after what happened to Jane, his sister, he could only begin to phantom what he'd do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older brother Matt stretched and yawned, and slowly made his way to the table. Completely contrary to Brandon's fears, Matt simply greet him and Sarah, and than his sibling Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bro! Fabulous lunch we're having, eh? Perhaps you'd like to join us?\" The Jane-turned-JessicaRabbit said. She gave a sly wink, and Matt said \"Sure sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled up a set and say himself down next to her, and pulled back his sleeve slightly, with Jane pulling off her shorter glove. They clapped hands, did a little twirl with their fingers and, a heart symbol and a spin followed by a poke to each others cheeks. It was an endearing sibling ritual Brandon had seen the two do countless times before, but there was something definitely different about seeing it now that Jane had turned into a young bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkwardness didn't stop, as Matt poured Jane some more soup and 'spoonfed' her some of it, or tried to anyway. The sort of cutesy brother-sister behavior wasn't unknown to Brandon, even if he thought it was unbearably lame. But what would he know, it's not like he had any any sisters, he reasoned. But now it was, certainly a different sight to witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out Matty darling, you know I'm too old for that sort of thing bro.\" She insisted.<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you sure? Well when are you too old for some tickledsayswhat?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked, her raspy voice more soothing and endearing than ever,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! What is right!\" With that, affectionate exclamation Matt jumped over and started tickling Jane, sending her into fits of giggles uncontrollably. He fingered about her dress and groped around her elbows and armpits and waist, sending her into a flurry. \"No darling, hahahaaa oh god stop..Brooo nooo!\" She objected, trying playfully and fruitlessly to shake him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finally done, she had almost fallen out of her chair, and was breathing heavily giggling like a school girl. \"Well, enough of that. I need to eat up and finish my homework after, so no more bro. And you need to eat up too, and grow up big and stroong.\" She poked his nose and lined her way down to his chin, flicking him slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their little sibling charade ceased, Sarah and Brandon looked at each other again. Brandon almost couldn't help bursting into a small chuckle, even though he knew it was probably terribly disturbing on some level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just about enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sarah grit her teeth furiously, and got up suddenly as if about to make a dash. Brandon grabbed her shoulder and said \"Yes, I think we've all had enough by now. Why don't we just eat up quickly and go see what's on tv later. Jane, why don't you do your work with us while we hang out. If you don't mind?\" He slowly yanked Sarah down and with infuriating reluctance, sat her back in her seat, still eyeing Jane's ring that had caused this absurd little scene. He picked up Sarah's sandwich and started stuffing it into her mouth, giving her the cue to keep quiet. She grumbled as she chewed, and spit it out on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yippers skippers, you know it doll!\" Jane said, the first plucky phrase her confirmation for 'yes', and the second an alluring one from another source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah 'hmmped' and quietly slurped her soup.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Frustrated, he knocked it against a stray table, and than rubbed it against his own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid piece of junk. I don't know why I thought it would work anyway. Plus Jane is right outside, why would it even do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, it started seething red again, only this time it vibrated on his finger and steam emitted out. \"Woah, what? The shaking or something must have set it off. Just needed a little bump is all!\" Also emitted, was a clear liquid, except as it flowed and wet his hand it started to fade a cream color against his skin and running like wet paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah what's happening! This, isn't what I wished for!\" And yet, the ring continued to flow. The runny liquid poured and ran up his arm, coating it so and sticking itself to his body. As hard as he pulled on the gooey film, it only spread to his other arm and chest. The steam obscured his vision and started forming the same sensations across his face. Soon before long it had crawled across his body completely, his entire figure obscured by the steam. His head felt hazy, like he was going to pass out. And that's practically what he did, but a strange jolt brought him back to his sense before he fell over and the steam finally started to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, he rubbed his eyes and tried dusting off his clothes. Hmm, black blouse, white undershirt, red skirt, mary jane shoes, white knee-high socks. Everything seemed to be in order, and strangely wasn't wet or anything. The ring slowly simmered down and finally stopped vibrating, returning to it's normal color. He certainly felt strange, but not sick or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into a shiny surface, he saw a pale, freckle faced girl with glasses, short black hair, a stubby nose and clearly female physique staring back. He was completely identical to Jane, but noticed nothing different in herself even after having transformed into her physically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing even happened? How uncool. It was probably just a stage prop for a magician I suppose. Well, I best get moving.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon wasn't always the most avid comic reader,but there were plenty of comics of a different kind he occasionally liked. Webcomics, a new and growing medium of comics displayed on the internet! With the availability of all of technology at their disposal, people had begun drawing digital comics and posting them on the web. These usually had higher themes and artwork than the usual variety of comics, for example the page size, 'canvas' and restrictions that might limit an artist on paper no longer existed. Some of them were even done with animations or fancy web tricks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had read quite a lot in his day. He was an avid reader of old sprite comics, like 8 bit Theater. There were countless slapstick comics, and plenty about videogames, such as VGcats, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and Penny Arcade. Of course those were gag strips, not ones built for story or character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the more popular ones filled that niche however. Like the infamous MSPaint Adventures, which detailed the adventures of both Detective explores Sleuthing Problems, and the nefarious Homestuck, which told a a very long Scifi fantasy epic. It had so many characters, from aliens to jackals and goths and robots and everything inbetween, I'd be an extravaganza to meet someone from there. There was also the bastard child of MSPA, Prequel which was about Katia Managan, a khajiit (talking cat person) trying to start a new life, while facing mystery, magic and tragedy. Based on the Elderscrolls videogame series, Brandon thought it would be truly novel to be able to talk to Katia, and all her hard struggles and adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe webcomic 'Lackadaisy' was also about walking talking cats, slick in their vest and cloaks as they performed high felons in a 20's era Prohibition romp ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd than there was Gunnerkrigg Court, the story of Antimony Carver and her days in a magical school, full of paranatural and stupendous adventure. As a Spiritual medium between her school's technologically advanced court, and the spiritually, magically inclined forested woods, she was a literary wonder-child. Being intelligent, patient and crafty, explorative and with quite a few stories of her own, the young redheaded girl always attracted ghosts, gods, spirits, and other beings. Just talking to her would be a goldmine, if the ring could really summon anybody.</span></div></div>",

They usually had many conflicting personality and fractions, and much of the drama resolved around these these all interacting.

She'd certainly be confused. A talking animal more so, since he wouldn't know how to explain it to people. There were some choices he figured that would be close enough to his modern society that it wouldn't cause a stir up, but the downside of that was, I'd probably be a pretty boring choice at that. At least, much less interesting than a fantastical one. However, mundane as it might be, he realized that might be the best possible choice for now until he could assess how powerful the ring was.

Worst comes to worst, she just makes a few people mad before Brandon could reign her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there might be more exciting choices.</span></div></div>",

Surely she was wicked and a vile person at heart, but she possessed no magic of any kind. If things got out of hand, at worst the police could probably deal with her, since she was just a mere mortal and in this century and reality would just be a cranky old lady at worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan again, she was still an adult. It's not that he was that afraid, but having such a crass women in his garage might blow up and cause a lot of attention. He surely wouldn't want the police getting involved actually, and even though he didn't think her too violent or murderous like some of the other villains, it's not like she would serve him a cup of tea and be pleasant conversation. This was more difficult than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon punched a nearby wall in frustration, not taking in that it was his ringed finger and he had shaken it and smashed it slightly, the physical activity starting the first part of the process. It had begun to glow a deep red, but it's true power wouldn't be shown until he made a formal wish or atleast strongly willed request, even mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, indecision was still his guide. He considered one of the Evil Step sisters, they weren't as cunning or crafty as the evil lady Tremaine. One of them even turned good in the direct to DVD sequel, so they're just ordinary spoiled brats anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also considered the Queen of Hearts, whose performance wooed him with her wicked demeanor and treatment of Alice.</span></div></div>",

Right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe Brandon could consider one of the daughters. I mean, they were mean and evil and ugly, sure, but they were younger, which worked for something. And they could be a little more fun to have around than Lady Tremaine might be. Brandon quickly decided that since it is Anastasia that became nicer in those later films, as not a great as the original as they were, he would pick Anastasia over Drizella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe Lady Tremaine would actually be a better choice? Lady Tremaine was reserved and quieter, more intimidating in her ways. Anastasia would loudly complain about her surroundings. She would totally make a scene.

That'd be more than enough to tickle his fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever what superhero to bring was another issue in itself. It might be dangerous if he brought a shady or difficult one to real life, he realized that a Real Life batman would probably just get arrested or never have the crusade that he did in the comics when provided by the writers. Equally, a real life Superman character would draw the militaries attention the second he went out trying to save lives. The fact that people thought these heros to be fictional characters would complicate things that much more. There were some indie comics that had more casual characters, but most of those were so bland I'd just be like bringing another real life person to his doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing a more down to earth hero might be preferable. A Marvel hero, like Cyclops or Spiderman could fit more casually into everyday life. They were used to blending in and facing trouble from authority, so simply having them sit down and have a conversation, or even show off their powers slightly without getting ahead of themselves would be a simple chore.

They usually weren't that personable either, when they weren't working everyday jobs, they lived and were employed on a Giant space station in the sky thousands of miles away from any relate-able normal human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the Marvel characters were still civilians aswell, ones that lives among people and knew how to behave and socialize properly.

A wet black nose adorned the very tip of his face, with two doggy eyes across his widened face. He was only about a good foot and a half high and 2 feet wide from his scruffy tail to his nose. Brandon raised his paws, unable to decipher the drastic change that had occurred. A pink bow lay atop his head, and a black collar rung around his neck.

This ring let's you create costumes and appearances for yourself, only it becomes real! With limitless transformational power in your hand, your imagination can go wild now! Better yet, it can work on other people too. All the characters you wanted to be or thought of being, how exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only it worked quite that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle do you know, the ring has a catch. 'You' won't just be becoming those characters, they'll be becoming you! Once you put on the ring and start to change into a character, your everyday life and personality will take over their character and body, remaining 'you' in some way, while still being drastically different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, if some fanciful character were accessed, it would just become them as some silly kid. If a talking cartoon animal or anime were to be made from your mom, they'd suddenly think they were your mom, while becoming a subdued version of themselves. If the hero of a Novel or Show is created around your little sister, that's who they'll think the are while trying to adjust.  The new character retains slights of their personality and behavior, while still trying to fulfill the new role they've been cast in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, think of it like that character is forced to try to \"Act\" like they're in a movie, with the \"Role\" being whoever they've replaced themselves as. Often to hilarious or ridiculous results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce changed, a person-turned-character can only be reverted back with the Ring. They won't be able to properly react or realize it before than.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor even further effect, the ring can work multiple times on a single person, meaning you can make a Character think they're another character thinking they're the transformed person they replaced!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set up some basic characters and hopefully utilized the concept right, so any other new characters or fictions you want to use are perfectly open and on the table, so long as it goes with the Interactive's premise. I'm not going to nitpick or hound anyone that \"Doesn't Get it right\" or insist you understand perfectly, just try your best and have fun, and I'll make sure to help anyone along if they feel they need or want it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Some basic rules:<br>\r\n1.Try the best you can, I know the concept is a little confusing but if you get the hang of it can be a lot of fun!<br>\r\n2.No gratuitous Violence or Sex please, try to keep it clean. <br>\r\n3.Use proper grammar and spelling, and add chapters that are acceptable and advance the story<br>\r\n4.Don't be afraid to experiment and have fun with it!<br>\r\n5.Be respectful and mindful of other people and their contributions, go with the flow ya know?<br>\r\n6.And lastly, biggest pet peeve of mine, you have to add actual story. No chains of long options past the beginning portion (first 10 chapters), no \"Should X or Y\" request, and if I see just entire branches of dead storylines that go nowhere or no one wants to take up and write I'm just going to delete them. Even 'Option' chapters should have atleast 100-300 words minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm stating this as a major beef because I'm allowing fictional characters in this, and that's something that rarely goes well in these types of stories. If you make a suggestion for a series or character, you better be prepared to use it or waddle your way towards what you need to use. Don't just offer options and expect other people to write them out for you, don't offer suggestions you know won't be written. Basically I'm just trying to avoid the <i>'1000 chapters of Character Possibilities but no real story</i>' scenario</b></td>",
