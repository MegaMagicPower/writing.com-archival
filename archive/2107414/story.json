It was not a force of blood thirsty demons. Though it had the strength of the mystic realm. It wasn't as cunning as Kyubi's sorcerery, but caused mass chaos none the less. One by one, yet again, the kingdoms fell. From the smallest of peasents, to the mightiest of gods. The new darkness spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who stood against it were reduced to mere bodies in its path. It did not bare swords nor spears. It need not arrows or bullets. But merely a swipe of the hand and a wiggle of their fingers. Something so childish had become a weapon of mass proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn army of tickle trained sorcerers.....led by a multi armed enchanter who grew stronger from each bit of laughter.</span></div></div>",

They believed they could out last the sieges the mysterious demons threw at them. For a while it looked hopeful. Casualties were minimal if any and supplies were holding true. The Tickdema were not so easy to give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had found the one vulnerability in every last hold. Anything from slipping in spirits through the water supply for a surprise tickle-take-down, to learning the gate guards desires and tempting them enough to let them march right in. However the Wei were able the regroup into their final hold. After the numerous tricks, the remaining great generals convened and came up with an abundant amount of counters to the previous attacks, forcing the Tickdema to truly have to work to topple the final hold. Amassing their ranks around the stronghold, the Tickdema prepared for an all out assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPang De gathered his calvary units and ordered them to prepare a retreat, taking civilians to safety. He would provide a distraction to lead the Tickdema away long enough for a safe escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXu Huang readied an armored battalion at the gates. He was to lead a counter charge once the gates were breached in an attempt to confuse their enemies. The running game was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhang He assisted in lining the walls with archers and spear wielding troops. He was tasked with keeping the enemy off of the gates and away from the stronghold, causing as much damage as possible before the fight came in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Zhang Liao lead a small militia to the front gate. Rather than Xu Huang, he was in charge of hitting the enemy before they reached the gates, adding to the damage Zhang He inflicted.</span></div></div>",

The Tickdema, distracted with countless sieges, had ceased the slaughter of Wu, leaving a specter unit to quite literally haunt the crippled forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wu wasted no time in seizing their fleeting opportunity, the three remaining leaders forming their ranks and preparing their counter march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLu Xun lead two armored battalions to form the front ranks.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taigong Wang was the youngest of the Mystic Generals. His immortality was still new and compared to Fu Xi, Nuwa or even Sanzang. As such he'd never seen anything like the Tickdema. The way they'd swept through the combined military of the resistance he doubted it otherwise they'd have been more prepared to fight against them and they're strange strategies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the fall of Tamamao and Orochi they'd appeared at the gates of several different holds, cities and castles. They varied in appearance wildly from the basic sorcerers and they're damnable magic, ropes feathers and hands to the lizard giants who sampled their captives using their long tongues as they carried them off to wherever they were taking the poor souls. It felt like everyday a new kind of creature spotted leading the remaining snake and fox demons and taking more captives off into the night squealing and laughing. The Tickdema surged through fortresses and villages capturing everyone in their path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaigong Wang had been with a number of the other great Warriors who'd taken up residence in the former fortress of Orochi. They stood maybe 200 strong. Still the godly fisherman's shrewd strategies had led them there and brought in new people daily. The coded messages he'd had carved into the deceased demons his men slew had been a particular stroke of genius. It didn't surprise the not humble deity that those plans had worked. He had been granted his divinity because of his genius tactics and the macabre messages had brought in a number of survivors. His own aspiring pupil Lu Xun had been one of those that had decoded it and had led his own ragtag band to him strengthening their would-be garrison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes after all these genius moves moves it really stung that he'd been brought so low by his own foolishness. To have believed such a fool as a former bandit and to stake his own skin on his word that the area was free of the Tickdema. He'd come here on word from a bandit that there had been a few soldiers hiding in this ruined village. Taigong Wang was impressed with such a tale and felt that the risk was worth it to try to help such men and to bring them to the fortress as allies. The bandit said that the area was devoid of any of the hungry sadists that had chased them all to the fortress and like an absolute dullard he'd believed the fool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''IS ANYONE LEFT!?'' the Divine Strategist called out to the dark forest. The only response he received was the laughs of what he assumed was the Tickdemas looking for him. His divine rod had allowed him to defeat a few of the mask wearing sorcerers earlier and aid his men but his own rotten luck had cost him as one of his soldiers breaking rank in fear had collided with him and caused him to lose it in the mud. When a boar demon had charged in he'd been forced to abandon it by fleeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting some distance between himself and the boar demon that had pursued him, Taigong Wang had doubled back to try and check on his men but found the village emptied out once more. The cast off armor and discarded weapons(minus his own rod.) did not lend themselves to the chances of their success. The pragmatic Wang had moved on pausing only to pick up a short sword to defend from the fiends that he knew were looking for him. After only a few steps one such creature came around the corner and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature resembled an ornate set of heavy armor. From the waist up at least. Below was...nothing. The large black breastplate adorned with feathers was simply floating above the ground. A set of disgustingly thick lips floated above the empty neckhole. A pair of heavy gauntlets served as it's arms and flew to it's mouth upon sighting him. It let out a horrifically deep giggle before charging forward at him crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Heeheehee!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaigong Wang started at it's reaction speed before starting to adopt a defensive pose with the short sword he'd picked off the ground. This was merely muscle memory having been drilled into him for years by Fu Xi. Given a second his brilliant mind realized that standing against an unknown enemy with an unfamiliar weapon was the height of foolishness but at that point it was too late. The monster had closed the and was already reaching forward with one of it's hands at the Warrior. Taigong Wang allowed it's reach to take it forward before dropping to the ground and letting it sail over him. He immediately set out to put some distance between them but found his free wrist encircled in an almost iron grip pulling him back and almost dislocating the divine being's shoulder from it's socket. OF COURSE if it had no lower body and was truly floating then turning around mid lunge would be no problem for it! He was off today and was about to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''W-wait beassstahahaHAW''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature pulled him back and cradled him before slipping a finger under the man's robes and into the Mystic's armpit hollow. He'd never thought of himself as ticklish and honestly couldn't believe the ease with which the creature had taken him into it's arms and was now tickling away at him. He squirmed and banged the blunt infantryman's sword against the creature but it only made the beast smile even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bad boy. Temper tantrums will get you nowhere.''<br>\r\n''Reeeheeleeahase me at once demon!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaigong Wang the divine strategist and proud general of the Mystic army barely even noticed as a third hand snaked out the open hole at he bottom of it and wrapping around his free wrist. It snuck a finger into the clenched hand gripping the sword and drug a nail slowly down the strategists palm. The childish giggling was humiliating to the proud young god and despite himself finally the gentle stroking forced him to release his grasp on the sword. At the loud clank of the steel on the ground the creature began taunting the once-proud general. The creature clucked happily and began gently rocking Taigong Wang back and forth in it's arms as it headed towards the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wai-wait WAIT!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature paused in the attention it gave to it's captive but continued on it's trajectory into the forest with him in it's rapidly multiplying arms as a fourth now stroked his thigh through his dirty robe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''P-perhaps we can reason here? Whatever your goal it can surely be reached peacefully?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand grasping the man's hand released his wrist and traveled to his face, cupping his cheek it stroked the reddened skin. Taking a gamble the tactician twisted out the creatures arms and landed on his feet. Immediately he took off at a run yelling at the top of his for his troops, fellow generals or anyone to assist him. A pair of dainty yet extremely strong hands closed around his wrists before dragging them back. Snapping back at the force the pristine robes of Taigong Wang were sullied as he landed in the mud however this was barely noticed as his were further dragged above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wretched demon! I am a proud general of the Mystic forces and will not be treated this by you or any of your fellow ghouls! Release me at once!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was instead dragged back through the mud like a whining child by his wrists. The monster drew closer floating almost directly over him. Now the hands reeling him in pulled him towards that black hole in the bottom of the creature. As own hands disappeared into it he attempted to plant his feet but instead they slipped and scrabbled in the mud making it worse for him. He was dragged into the armor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside he felt more hands attending to a number of different tasks. Some impossibly small ones wrapped around his fingers and pulled them into the sleeves of the armor, As his head entered he felt some stroke his skin and others push him until he saw the saw the welcome light of the sky. His head sticking out through the neckhole Taigong Wang realized the scope of his situation. Now the damned creature was forcing him to wear it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his arms but felt them held tighter than he could move them in the arms of this nightmare. The arms bent dragging his own inside them along and bending the Divine over then grabbing ahold of his own ankles. The hands of the armor lifted them up into the air in front of him. Now was he not only trapped in this damn armor but he was held like a baby awaiting changing. The humiliation for the man was barely registered though as inside the horrific monster he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillions of tiny little devilish hands! All over every inch of the skin beneath the armor they stroked, teased, scratched, pinched, poked and swirled. Both under his clothes and through millions of the little dastards tortured him and he couldn't control himself at their ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''AHHHH HA-HA-HA NOHO NOHO NOHO BAAAHA!!?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face burning with heat and embarrassment he didn't even notice the those damn ghastly floating lips. They turned and smiled at their captives delicious tear streaked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They'll love you at the castle. Who could've thought that the proud strategist of the Mystic would look like this. Just a cute little giggly boy and that it would only take one lucky low level beast like me to catch you! I think we'll take the long way there so I can enjoy you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the monstrous lips puckered up and planted themselves on tortured master of tactics. As the monster went deeper into the forest with it's prize all that could be heard in the was raucous laughter occasionally interrupted by a loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">''SMOOCH!''</font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fog clouding the Divine's mind cleared as he realized the situation and his position. After the creature had abducted him he had lost consciousness in it's grip eventually after an hour or so of tormentingly soft touches and torturous smooches. Now he was here in a dingy and dark jail of sorts. A heavy wooden stock trapped his wrists on either side of his head and kept the formerly proud warrior from fiddling with the similar stocks trapping his sandaled feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squirmed in his bondage and strained in an attempt to escape but it was useless. Still the proud mystic fought and struggled until the door to his cell opened. A creature entered that seemed to almost be a tree atop a set of spider legs. Wang brain raced as he attempted to come up with a clever strategy to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''WAIT! I can make a deal with you. What would you like to know or have?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature moved closer and Wang noticed the various limbs of the beast hanging down ending in flowers. The strategist wondered why the Tickdemas would have a beast like this but still knew of their tendencies and attempted to bargain to try and improve his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I know where other's hide! Name a general and I could tell you where they make their base!'' the Tactician pleaded with the the faceless creature which stepped closer to his vulnerable form. He bucked in his bonds trying for even the slightest give that he could use his genius to exploit. As the creature stood over him he watched in horror as the various flowers adorning the creatures branches shook while they moved closer. The flower's opened slowly blooming forward long and slimey tongues unfurling and dripping with saliva as if savoring what they imagined the Warrior tasted like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long tongues ran over the sensitive silks of the divine's thigh and slithered their way down at the same time another pair lapped at the man's cheeks and another set of devils snuck into his sleeves. Taigong Wang the divine strategist had no choice but to feel as the appendages wrapped themselves around the straps of his sandanls and pulled them free of his socked feets. The man trained by gods to become one felt tongues running down his forearms and sneaks themselves into his embarassingly sensitive hollows to delight in the unprotected sweet meats that were those ticklish nerve ending filled pits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe divine screamed and moved past words incredibly quickly, little did he know what the very air in this place did. He attempted to beg but only managed guttural laughter at the invading tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hooohaahhhaanoohohooo!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongues at his feet had wrapped the straps of his sandles and pulled them free from the man leaving the mans sensitive socked soles available but before that several dozen more fiendish tongues slipped down his sleeve and now the tips of the tongues tickled away around the man's stomach in various places, He twitched and danced trying to suck his belly away serving only to frustrate his tormentor. The tree-like creature snagged a few of the many tongues tore at the divine's fine robes and tore them away to expose his tummy completely as well to the cold. A disembodied voice sang through the chamber laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Koochie, koochie koo all these tickles are just for you! This is your new life Taigong Wang.''<br>\r\n''NOOHOO LEHHET MEEHEE GOOOHO!!''<br>\r\n''Ohh precious little bird. Sing for all of us here! Too long has your world been filled with anger, pain and sadness all cried out by the different voices. We have come here to unite the many different voices of you all in harmonious laughter.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongues circled around the strategist's sensitive belly button lightly as the others relaxed their assault's on his hollows and cheeks. Now they teased the skin on the man's belly in concentric circles widening outwards ever sooo sloowly while savoring the quivering flesh. Taigong Wang held his giggles back knowing that if that was what the creature to hear the least he could do was try to hold it from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why do you hold back your beautiful voice my divine bird? Your voice is gorgeous and all of us here in this place want to hear it.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devilish organs slid across his pale skin but reversed direction so that now they passed back along the slimy trail they'd previously left in a ring on the youngest of the Mystic Army's general attractively toned stomach. Creating a tightening ring of tickles heading back towards that poor little belly button which had so far remained unmolested. Though his eyes were screwed shut in defiance Taigong Wang could feel their path and sense their intention bracing himself for his torture's next step and attempting to ready himself. His jailer taunted him by pausing the damn tongues just as they all stood stock still just outside the sensitive little orifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Precious being. Glorious being. Divine being. Our being now. Not a soldier, not a servant never a slave. Now you are but a toy.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sets of stocks imprisoning the Warrior suddenly slammed to the ground stretching him taut in a not painful but not at all comfortable position. Although it was an odd time to realize Taigong Wang's mind did realize that the insides of his stockades were somewhat loose and allowed his hands and feet a significant amount of wiggle room because of that. The reason for that became clear when another series of flowers adorning the branches of his tormentor started to bloom. These pink flowers opened up and released numerous tongues from each!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese new players slithered along and inserted themselves into those gaps in such numbers that they stopped that give and decided to take it upon themselves to wrap around the fingers and toes of the strategically minded general turned toy of the Tickdemas shredding the socks and exposing those vulnerable toes before wrapping around them and Taigong Wang's fingers as well. The tongues wrapped around those and pulled them back until their tips were juuust barely grazing the stocks. These actions stretched the skin of Taigong Wang's palms and soles taut and smooth. The tips of the tongues dragged along the man's sensitive soles and palms driving him insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''GYAHAHAA NOOHOO PLEEEHEEESE!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaigong Wang didn't even know it was possible to have ticklish palms but here he was begging any of the other divines to save him and his terrifically ticklish ones. The damnable tongues slurped up and down and all around his palms as well as sneaking to paint in between the strategists fingers. Along his soles varying speeds were employed in his torment. Quick sneaky tongues poked at his toe pads that were held tight in their comrades grasp. Meanwhile slow and torturous figure eight's were dragged up his arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny gives in his bondage was gone. Instead his wrists and ankles were just as victim to the slobbering tongues which teased his skin with random pulses driving him up the wall. He begged and pleaded for mercy as his tormentor drew ever closer producing yet more branches bearing those damned flowers which rustled along with his laughter as they fed. Taigong Wang tried to choke back the laughter roaring in him but crumpled when a sneaky tongue got frisky with his bound baby toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''HEEHEHAAHAAA''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flowers bloomed at the outburst releasing multiple tongues this time who went straight for his feet. The multitude of squirming and slimy appendages moved as one wrapping themselves around the poor pedicured pair setting each and every nerve they grazed which was each and everyone ablaze! Taigong Wang attempted to buck and kick at the damned invaders but all that led to was the tickling on the imprisoned feet increasing leading to another unwanted outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''PLEEHESE!!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis poor succulent soles were trapped in a vortex of sucking tongues that quivered as one teasing entity catching every single tickly spot with each slurp. He did his best to try to pull himself free of the the slowly moving upwards cocoon but found every attempt seemed to pull his him deeper so that now he was discovering that ankles could be ticklish too as they tickled around the bone driving him up the wall and making him kick inadvertently which only got him in deeper which seemed fortunate for the foliage as a new batch of flowers were proffered forwards to the strategist wracked with laughter which they needed to bloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Surrender my precious Songbird and assist us in adding more voices to the choir!''                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Li Dian was a strong general of Wei once upon a time. In a world where the Tickdemas hadn't yet ravaged the world and the bodies of millions he was a smart and loyal warrior in the service of his lord Cao Cao and his son the prince of Wei Cao Pi. Li Dian had led armies and fought them back when Orochi's hordes were the greatest threat to Wei and the rest of humanity. Now a new kind of demon horde was at the gates but Li Dian was not as adept at facing these enemies. Plans laid out were quickly exposed through ticklish interrogations which the enemy seemed very skilled at. Traps laid were outsmarted and reversed leading to losses which exposed more information due to the enemies penchant for capturing as opposed to killing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to the current situation. Li Dian had been waiting for Taigong Wang to return with the new recruits he'd been so interested in but instead a force of demons had come in led by the divine strategist and had set to capturing as many of the few soldiers of Wei left in Li Dian's care as well as the unimportant soldiers and civilians not in the service of the Cao family. If it wasn't for one of his famous ''hunches'' then Li Dian would be just like the unlucky handmaiden being carted by in the care of a new kind of those monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature resembled for all intents and purposes a young girl. A young girl with a floating set of stocks for a lower body and a second set of arms that seemed double jointed and longer than average but beyond that a normal girl nonetheless. That particular one seemed far too focused on the poor servant's toes, arches and various other sole-meats to look to closely at it's surroundings and see the youthful general skulking in the shadows and wishing he'd been able to secure either his boots or Wheeled Halberd in the chaos of the attack. As the creature vanished down the hallway Li Dian stayed in the shadows until even the sounds of the monsters victim disappeared, Li Dian felt a twinge of regret as his own toes curled in sympathy at not being able to do anything for the poor servant. He had more than a feeling this time though that any action he took without thinking would just have him joining in her predicament as as opposed to helping her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer out-of-control laughter grew fainter as they turned the corner yet still Li Dian waited until it grew fainter still before disappearing, to make his move. He wasted no time in moving down the hallway away from the Tickdemas. First things first he needed to get out of this castle as it was a lost cause. If any of his fellow Wei were left they'd have surely had the same idea and they could link up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nyahahaha now where are you going my cute friend?!''<br>\r\n''You are a new face to me. You're certainly a General of Wei yet your not one I'm familiar with.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi Dian froze in place out of fear. He knew at least one of those voices and it didn't bode well for him. As he slowly turned and confirmed his suspicions that he had been discovered by none other than Taigong Wang the former Divine Strategist who had led the trap that had captured this castle. Li Dian's eyes darted back from the former pride of the Mystic's to his companion which at first glance seemed to be another one of the same monster as the one that had passed by before with the serving girl. On closer inspection though Li Dian had a hunch that the regal looking robes adorning it meant that it had a higher rank than that one. Just how high though was surprising to Li Dian as the girl/creature pulled the Divine traitor Taigong Wang in close by grabbing one of his wrists than using the other three to stroke along his sides and playfully dig into his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You don't know this one? He's much much better looking than the average peasant however I can not waste my writings upon a commoner.''<br>\r\n''Myheeehee lady you misunderstahahnd. I do not recognize the lad but a number of clues say that he is not the average soldier. No average soldier would have armor.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi Dian had heard enough he ripped at a curtain and threw it at the demon and her thrall before taking off at a run. A divinely thin thread wrapped around his right ankle without his knowledge put a stop to that and yanked his bare foot out from under him slamming him to the stone floor. As Taigong Wang pulled back more on his Divine Rod guiding it the Tickdemas next to him giggled and continued to run it's four hands along his slender frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh my! Well done! You caught him so easily Taigong Wang!''<br>\r\n''With ease my Lady Atona though I have yet to land the young General completely though as he has a bit of fight. Not uncommon for a General. Not that there was ever a chance of me being wrong though.''<br>\r\n''Nyahaha than allow me to help you!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi Dian rolled and kicked his bare feet at the cord but could barely see it and only managed to get that free foot snagged by the eager to help Tickdemas who quickly slammed into her stock-y lower half. Li Dian's famous hunches had him realizing that this was a really bad situation with one foot in caught by a traitorous fisherman and the other under lock and key of a Tickdemas. This was bad and it was getting worse as the longer arms grabbed ahold of his wrists pulling them back into the stocks as well. He thrashed and bucked but when it all came down to it he was caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi Dian the once proud general of Wei was now face down on the cold floor with his feet trapped in stocks soles up and his hands locked between them. He was completely and utterly helpless and the giggling Tickdemas queen already probing and stroking along the sides of his soles and getting a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Snnnrkahaha!''<br>\r\n''Oh my! Such soft feet do little to prove your status as a General. Yoohoo Taigong Wang are you sure that you've just not fed me a peasant with good fashion sense?''<br>\r\n''My Lady Atona I assure you that I have completed the task that Kyuubi had assigned to me. I have delivered you a General worthy of your art. Now while I don't know this General, he bears the colors of Wei and his attempt at escape shows a sense of skill. Sketch away and should you find him unworthy I will take it upon myself to make it up to you.''<br>\r\n''Such a cheeky thing you are Taigong Wang. I will take you up on that if you are wrong but still I can't help but love that confidence of yours. It's simply divine!''<br>\r\n''What is your name boy?''<br>\r\n''I am Li Diahahaha''<br>\r\n''My lady if you would restrain yourself for just a second? You have him at least let me know the boy's name.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Li Dian's one free foot was forced into the other stock the Tickdemas pouted but still she lessened her attack she still lightly stroked along the General's creamy soft yet strong sole but she did so lightly now. She was impressed though. Who would have thought that a General would take such good care of his feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I am hehee Li Dian of haha Wei! Release heehee mehee at once HAhaha! Please? Please reheelease me! Ahaht leeheast stopAHAHAHA NAHAT THE TOHOHOES!''<br>\r\nShe had pinched ahold of both sets Dian's pinky and big toes with her four hands and idly twiddled them back and forth as she hummed a tune to herself over his pleas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You have done well Taigong Wang he'll do wonderfully. You are excused and can tell Kyuubi I am pleased.''<br>\r\n'' With gratitude I will pass along the message my lady.''<br>\r\n''Now to focus on my art.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of quick pinches to his arches shocked him and she used that to her advantage to start pulling back each of his toes and pin them back to a set of hooks that kept them almost paninfully bent back so that his soles were stretched taut and almost completely motionless a fact which she celebrated by drumming away on them as she pulled out the paintbrushes! One slow and almost painful stroke of the brush began her sketching on Li Dian's soles as he began laughing his head off at the Tickdemas's painting. Slow strokes of the brush tormented his toes and drew lines down along his soles, circling the balls of his feet and branching off into roots upon his arches. She drew precisely and yet erratically keeping him from being able to predict her next turns and having him in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Naahahaha, Nahahaha, Nahahaha leheheme gohohoho!!''<br>\r\n''Ohh but why would I do that? When one has a laugh as infectious and bubbly as yours why would you bother to do anything but laugh?''<br>\r\n''Waahahahat''<br>\r\n''Nyahaha giggle away. I enjoy no better soundtrack to my work. A pair of wonderful feet like these will make a wonderful new addition to my works and I cannot wait to add them to the gallery back at the palace.''<br>\r\n''Gahahalerry??!'' <br>\r\n''Why yes! My own beautiful private gallery that Kyuubi granted me! Nothing but the prettiest and wiggliest pieces of beautiful art. All my own works of course you'll have a wonderful time!.''<br>\r\n''Hahaha I don't even like hahaha art l'm a Warrior!''<br>\r\n''Oh my! You misunderstand Li Dian! You are not invited to my gallery. You are an addition! All of my art is inscribed upon the prettiest pairs of feet that I have run across! A proud General's feet seemed the like a perfect new piece of canvas but you are a delightful surprise!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused her sketching to lightly trace a finger along the not quite drying ink now adorning the Wheeled Halberd master's soles causing him to dig his face into the cold floor so that the demon couldn't see his face a fact which slightly miffed her but she quickly forgot as she wiped the ink of her fingers on his toes ever so gently so that now she was essentially finger painting. Li Dian struggled in his bonds desperately as she resumed painting. He couldn't take this much more he had to get out of here...</span></div></div>",

With a scream the creature fell and Li Dian pulled his painted feet up as he curled into a still giggling ball. Yue Jin went to tend to his lieutenant as the monster shrieked.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Li Dian?! Can you walk?\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh I could yes but I have a hunch I wouldn't be much use in a fight. Whatever paint that thing applied still tingles as if fresh and the very air makes me hehehe well you can see. My diminuitive ally could you perhaps carry me?\"<br>\r\n\"You must be joking my friend. I love you like a brother but I doubt we could get far like like that.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly the boar's were upon them and it fell to Yue Jin to protect his friend. He fought as hard as he could but the beasts overpowered him through their sheer numbers and soon the two were being carried away under the creature's arms, laughing as their feet, legs and butts were played with. They were brought into a new room where upon the boars sat to beginning the two's torture. Yue Jin's ankles were seized in a massive hand each and pulled apart roughly until the short general was forced into a split. A tongue snaked out of the creatures mouth and dug in between his muscular thighs to tickle the sweet spot there. The warrior shrieked at the torment as the teasing began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uweeheehee we's caught us a little one! Who knew that a cute little boy like this would come to us so easily! Kitchy-kitchy-koo little boy! You taste soooo good in your tickly little spot that we might never stop!\"<br>\r\n\"I-AHAHAM NAHAHAT A CHILD! I AHAHAM A GRHOHOWN MAHHAHA-STAHAHAHAP!!

Does the baby have ticklish feets hiding in the cute baby socks? Tickle tickle!\"<br>\r\nMore tongues came as more boar demon's joined in and added their long slippery tongues which curled around the small socked feet of the warrior. He thrashed about like a worm on a hook at the feeling of the slippery tongues exploring between his socked toes and the sweaty chasm of his taint.<br>\r\n\"GAHAHAHA I'M NAHAHAHAT A CHIHIHLD! LEHEHET MEHEHE GOHOHOO! NOHOHOHO! PLEEHEEHEEASE! MEHEHERCY! STAHAHP NAHAHAO MORE! FIHIHINE I'M A CHIHIHLD!\"<br>\r\nGiant hands ripped away the man's chestpiece and began pinching at his toned chest while he thrashed and tried to protect himself. His wrists were were seized and massive fingers scratched at his palms and the tops of his hands.<br>\r\n\"I'M A CHIHILD! I'M A BAHAHABY! PLEHEHEASE STOP! NO MOHOORE TIHICKLES!

PLEEEHASE I'M A BAHABY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLi Dian's fate wasn't much better, One of the boars sat itself down and propped the Halberd Master up in his lap to begin pinching at the man's painted feet. It began playing a humiliating game of counting the man's toes.<br>\r\n\"Uwehe this little piggy went to market! This little piggy went home!\"<br>\r\n\"NOHOHO PLEAHASE! NAHAHAT THE PIGGIES!

Her sashes and orbs followed her graceful movements, although the same could not be said for her pursuer. \"When will you give insects give up? I've grown bored of this annoying chase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will never bow down to your whims, demon! By the name of the Heavenly Mystics, I swear you will divulge the means to return those blasted... <i>creatures</i> back to whence they came!\" Letting out another growl, the silver haired woman on the ground thrusted her rapier. Responding to her pin-point strikes, another aged oak fell to the forest floor as Da Ji was forced to relocate once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if Fu Xi or Taigong Wang were to see this, I'm sure a lecture on patience and elegance would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare utter their names, Vixen!\" Nu Wa gritted her teeth, irritation flooding her usually stoic facade. Pooling energy into her weapon, the swung blade of chi barely managed nick the edge of the seductress' flowing silks. \"I don't need them for this hunt, not when there's only a scurrying rat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you so certain, Deity of Serpents?\" The purple haired woman smirked. In all of Nu Wa's anger, she had failed to sense the new parties alerted by the commotion. \"If you're not careful, even a snake can be lead in circles by a cunning fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will never happen you-Arrghh!\" Nu Wa gasped while tumbling to the ground, the wind knocked out of her. Giggling, Da Ji motioned with a finger for her orb to return after successfully slamming into the Mystic's abdomen. \"I told you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, get back here you-!\" Quickly raising her buckler, two figures approached the lone duelist from the shrubbries. While both were feminine in appearance, their very presence and red skin screamed of a monster's revulsion. The larger of the two had four arms on its tattered, cloth covered body. The other merely levitated a few inches off the ground, its hands clasped together in a traditional lotus pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creatures born from that bastard Sorcerer? Come, I will show you mere pawns are no match for a divine Mystic.\" Spreading her stance, the muscular of the two creatures grinned and stepped forth. Cracking its knuckles, all four of her hands spread and encompassed Nu Wa's frontal space. Already, the latter knew this wasn't going to be an easy battle for her opponent had somehow guessed her weakness of wide-area attacks. \"Foolish! A warrior's best weapons are not their arms, but their blade and sheild. Return to the earth from where you came with this very lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpaling her sacred rapier directly into the creature's stomach, Nu Wa gave a victorious smirk. However, her countenance slowly turned for the worse when she was unable to pull out her weapon from the grinning female's body. Barely able to raise her buckler in time, Nu Wa gave a gasp as two hands wrestled her beloved shield into the air. With the final hand delivering the finishing blow to the Nu Wa's silky hollow, even the divine gave a girlish titter while clamping down on the exposed area, unwillingly releasing her hold on her only defensive tool. \"You cheheheheeating beast! I will have you sliced for laying a hand on my immortal body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you humans are all the same. All talk and no bite. Especially you boasting immortals.\" Giving a countering smirk at pushing Nu Wa's buttons, the divine pushed the thoughts of her original quarry aside to let out a shout of rage. Delivering several resounding thrusts of her chi-imbued rapier, the silver-haired divine grinned at seeing the wounds gouged into crimson red flesh. \"Fall, like the beast you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a cry of protest, both Da Ji and Nu Wa gave a gasp as the Tickldema demoness forcefully closed her injuries with regeneration before their very eyes. Barelling towards the duelist before she could respond, Nu Wa grunted as four arms wrapped around her body in a bear hug. \"Is that the best you can do? My immortality scoffs at your puny efforts and attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then goddess, can your immortality protect you from our master's methods?\" Nu Wa narrowed her eyes at the creature's words. Still maintaining the grip on her beloved rapier, panic shot through her body at the sensation of fingers slipping underneath her vest. \"Remove your fingers from there, beas-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you afraid, goddess? Afraid of the tales that have been told of my master? Of the multiple stories my kind has done to the humans? Or... are you afraid of a bit of tickling?\" Giving a savage leer, the demoness's fingers begun their march on Nu Wa's sides. Although her anger and stubborness persisted for a few minutes, eventually even the warrior's breathing became hitched, her lips trembling from strained effort. Within a few more seconds, Nu Wa's ferocity had vanished completely as her gritted teeth were forced into a silly grin, her legs softly kicking the air while her eyelids fluttered with hidden mirth. \"I will give you... one last chanceehheheeee... to release meeheheheee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better deal for you, goddess. I will give you one last chance to surrender, before I <b>make</b> you surrender.\" Seeing the prideful shake of her head, the creature raised Nu Wa higher into the air with a smirk. While the goddess still held out against the soft tickles, it wasn't till she felt the sensation of soft lips kissing her smooth belly did a piercing shriek echo through the forest. The sound was as sharp as her rapier, the desperate screech followed quickly by a flood of hysterical laughter. \"Unhahhahahhahaand mehehehehee! I deeheheheemaahahahaand you stohohoohohoop! Ceheheheheease tickling meehheheheee at once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that would be no fun. Laugh more for me, you weak, ticklish, goddess.\" Holding Nu Wa into the air by her wrists, the divine female dissolved into more frantic laughter with the addition of scribbling digits in her armpits. No matter how much she kicked or twisted her body, the hands merely found more ways to tease her sensitive skin. Even the clatter of her rapier on the ground barely registered in her ears. \"Okahahahahaay! I reheheheeelent! Now I beehehehheeeg you! Stoohoohohoop this torturous tickleehehhehehaahahahhaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDa Ji turned around, a cruel smirk plastered on her lips. It seems that the mighty and proud immortal mystic had her own eternal body used against her. With a few of her own charms, those monsters might even bend to her will. Who knows, she might even have <i>three</i> toys to play with before the sun descended in the west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping down without a sound, the fox spirit was inwardly startled by another voice. \"There is no use running, Da Ji the Schemer. Our master has called for your voice to entertain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow to me politely decline,\" Stalking towards the floating creature with swaying hips, Da Ji pushed the sound of Nu Wa's laughter and her four-armed tormentor to the back of her mind. Seducing this lump of clay shouldn't take much effort. \"My invitation extends to you, however. Would you like a chance to share in my... pleasures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her sultry words, the other female froze. Giggling already at the innocent reaction, Da Ji closed the gap with casual steps. Cupping one hand around the creature's crimson cheek, Da Ji leaned in with a husky breath. \"Just relax. This will all be over soon~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't... I must report back to...\" Shushing words with a single finger, Da Ji trailed her nails lightly along her naked body. Rewarded with bubbly giggles from her ribs, the fox already knew her next move. \"The Tickldema army, and the sudden appearance of its master. Care to tell me more? Don't worry, I can keep a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cahahhhaaan't tell you anythehehhheheee! Pleeheheheeease!\" Pushed up against a nearby tree, the creature's telekinetic powers gave way to Da Ji's insistent teasing. Squirming yet not trying to escape, Da Ji cooed when a light flutter across the tops of her breasts gave an uncharacteristic squeal. \"Such a ticklish little thing you are. Are all you dolls made like this? Or are you just special~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dahahhahahaa Ji! I cahahhahaan't mistreheheheheess! Not theehehheeere, pleehehheeease!\" The red-skinned female howled as fingers skittered underneath her jiggling chest. Her opponent gave a few sultry giggles of her own, inwardly pleased at the unprompted title. \"We can do this all day without your little friend hearing about this. If you'll tell me what I want to know, we can even drag her and that pesky Nu Wa for a fun session tonight~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of courseehehheheee, ahahahaaanything for you mistreheheheheheess!\" Da Ji purred. To have a broken toy dancing in the palm of her hand, or giggling in this case, was all too easy. Tickling the arch of an offered foot, the enchantress of Orochi almost had to wonder if it was too easy. Although the sounds of Nu Wa's laughter had died out over the course of her little escapade, Da Ji didn't pay it much heed. Occasionally a strange feeling would flutter across her own chest and feet, but again the vixen gave it no attention. After all, her opponent was defenceless right before her, reduced to a giggling mess. The sound of another's strange laughter echoed in her ears, but that could be a mystery left for later... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, both figures were in very different positions. The levitating creature calmly kept her lotus pose, eyes glowing an eerie shade of purple. Rolling with crazed laughter before her, Da Ji was lost in her own dellusions. Her hands spidered over her own silky feet, not even moving to brush away the conjured feathers licking her naked chest. Every now and then, the hysterical seductress would utter a few husky words, before collapsing into another bout of ticklish laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it done, sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This demoness thinks she can best me in a bout of deception.\" Watching their latest victim wriggle about, Da Ji switched to squeezing her own thighs. The vixen barely even noticed the increased octaves of laughter spilling from her lips. \"The results have displayed themselves.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two creatures gazed over the tied up figures of their giggling victims. Both Da Ji and Nu Wa remained trapped in an illusion of tickling each other, courtesy of their hovering captor. Its partner turned towards it, nodding at the cautionary measure as it began recovering discarded weapons. \"Shall we begin transporting them? The trek back to the dungeons is a long one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall be going no where, fiends of Tickledema.\" A soothing male voice spoke out. Stepping into the lush forest clearing, a male and female figure blocked the path. From their unique outfits and heavenly aura, anyone would be hard-pressed not to herald them from the Mystic clan. The female figure raised an arm, the long sleeves covering it flapping with her movement. \"That's right! We're here to stop you! On the names of Sanzhang and Shennong, we will not allow you to harm anyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harm? But all we've done is provide them with a little fun. Here, look at your friend.\" Tilting Nu Wa's mirthful face upwards, a plea of help could be seen behind her flowing tears. \"If anything, it looks like this divine toy is just begging for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unhand her, you brute!\" Sanzhang cried out. The brunette dashed foward, uncaring for her companion's shouts to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must assess the situation first, Sanzhang! Ugh... Why do I even bother.\" Drawing his whip, the handsome male followed his partner's assault. Sleeves and whips crackling against skin in tandem, the four-armed creature grunted in pain, slowly backing away from the giggling duo on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working. Just a little more, Shennong!\" Sanzhang whipped her sleeves once against bruised red skin. The monk's battle dance forced her opponent to bring its guard up, all four hands vainly blocking more of her skin from being painfully flayed. Sensing a constant rhythm in the dancer's movements, the creature gave a sickening grin before shooting out with one of its hands, deftly grabbing both of the female mystic's sleeves before hauling her in to the air with a squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go, you mud-filled doll!\" Shennong stepped forth, his whip cracking against the monster's sides. Attempting to make do without his main strengths of medicinal creation, the situation simply wasn't favoured towards the divine sovereign before, he too, was pulled into the air beside Sanzhang through the creatures counter-attack. With the mystic's whip tangled around his own wrists, both divines shared a look of concern as the creature flourished a phoenix's feather in either of its two remaining hands. Where or when had it procured such a heavenly object was beyond their knowledge. \"Ready to laugh like your friend did, immortals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst, we can take it!\" Sanzhang defiantly said. The creature gave a savage grin, before beginning its teasing. Softly wiggling the feathers underneath their noses and necks, cute sneezes and boyish grunts filled the glade as both divines experienced the agonizingly ticklish tool for the first time. \"Such delicious noises. Will your giggles be any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your attempts at torture have no effect on us, creahahahahahaaaa!\" Shennong found himself forced to chuckle with boyish giggles. The feather trailed a ticklish path along the center of his chest before returning to his neck. Even through his robes, he felt the fronds licking against his bare skin as if nothing was covering his body. \"No effect? Did we mention our master procurred these feathers for a special reason?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you girl? Will you fare any better than this boy?\" Satisfied as it forcefully extracted more snickers from the male mystic with another feathery lap, their tormentor turned towards a fuming Sanzhang. Dipping the other phoenix plume into the female's baggy pants, the brunette couldn't hold back her giggles when the feather swept a ticklish line along her navel. \"Come oneehheheheeehee! This isn't fahahahhhaahaair at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is fair in war. Or would you like any lesson?\" The creature gently taunted. Pulling one side of Shennong's obi open with a hand, the two hands quickly got to work. Lightly circling around the male's exposed nipple with one plume, the other tool gingerly dipped in and out of Sanzhang's belly button. With both boyish and girlish giggles now filling the meadow, the creature smirked at seeing both divine's twisted smiles. \"How is that? Is this heavenly enough for both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your woohohohooorst? Nu Waahhahahahaa's lectures keehehheeept me awaahahahhaaaake more than you eeehehehehheeever could!\" Sanzhang taunted back through her bubbly giggles. Peeved at the brunette's words, the creature roughly threw the male onto the ground, freeing up an extra hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I deliver you to my master, you will wish for the quick release of death.\" One hand still holding the female monk aloft, another pulled the front of her pants while a third hand dusted the ticklish plume into her navel once more. With the last hand making crazed circles along her trembling belly, the female divine's giggles quickly turned into fullblown laughter with both her sensitive midriff and taut stomach exploited to their full potential. No matter how hard she kicked or screamed, her tormentor didn't even give her the benefit of drawing a single breath. Eventually, the creature tossed the heaving toy onto the ground, the divine still weakly giggling as she curled into a ball with arms wrapped around her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you can escape so easily, boy.\" Barely managing to grab something from his bag, Shennong forced himself to keep calm as he was brought into the air once more. Face to face with the creature's leer and multiple hands and feathers, even he wondered how long his immortal stamina would hold out. \"Is this your goal, monster? To torture the daylights of any living being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all. Just the fun ones, starting with you,\" The creature said. It toyed with the male mystic's nipples, a feathery plume dusting both uncovered and covered areola. In response, Shennong yelled in hoarse laughter. The phoenix's materialistic properties made it so that even if it made indirect contact against his sensitive flesh, the results still felt as bad as if he were stark naked. His tormentor's final free hand voraciously squeezed whatever remaining laughter he had from his ribs, spidering the inside of his robes like a well-versed musician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, demon! This monk will not let you harm her friends any further!\" Sanzhang leapt from behind the creature, her sleeves barely hanging onto their tormentor's stout neck. Her ragged breathing paled in comparison to the victorious chuckle in her ears. \"Is that so? What could a ticklish toy like you do, after being broken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Provide a distraction!\" Exchanging a look with a flustered Shennong, the female mystic released her hold just as her companion threw the bag he had barely managed to stow away. With its contents released onto the red skinned female, purple powder clung to its large body. \"What is this? A petty trick of you mystics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a trick. This, my friend, is a gamble.\" Experiencing a searing sensation, the creature let out a howl before releasing its quarry. Landing in a heap on the ground, the wisened male took a moment to catch his breath before continueing. \"This is a rare chi-dispersing herb I've managed to discover down the mountains. It would usually be used in small pinches, but I gandered you were merely a chi-infused doll. By grinding up a large amount of these plants, the results can clearly be seen on your physique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling out in agony, the creature's four arms desperately tried to scratch the powder off. No matter how hard or fast she tried, the sticky substance clung to more of her body with every movement. \"This can't be! A trick! This has to be a parlor trick of you cursef humans! We djinn cannot be defeated by the likes of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a final cry, the female's form crumbled into dust. With only a pile of dried clay signifying her previous existence, Shennong let out a sigh of relief while taking a hold of the sleeve offered to him. \"You have much to learn, Sanzhang. But... you have my gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hear that from the wise Shennong. It must be my lucky day!\" Sanzhang said. The girl showed a smile of relief, before turning to their third companion. \"Nu Wa! We're coming over to untie you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of insistence on the tied mystic's face, along with a bundle of cut ropes lying next to her, was too late to warn them of the escaped threat. Saddling up behind Shennong, the male felt a musky breath tickling his ear. \"How long has it been, Shennong? Are you ready to accept my advances?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm afraid not, Da Ji. On behalf of the divine Mystics, we'll be-Hey, Sanzhang!\" Grunting with annoyance, two sleeves had shot out towards him to entangle his upperbody. While the female vixen giggled at having been successfully shielded behind him, her hands lingered on his body. \"I saw what that doll did. That other thing might be gone for now, but I can teach you a little thing or two myself~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da Ji, you vixen, don't you daahahahhaaare!\" Shennong let out an airy snicker. His arms struggled to remove a nervous Sanzhang's lengthy clothes even as sharp nails trailed playfully along his chiseled abs. The teasing fingers drawled various shapes across his bare skin, rewarding Da Ji with forced chuckles from the mystic's mouth. \"First thahahahaat demom, and now you Da Ji? Weeehheheere you the one in cahahahahooohohooots with its master?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chaos brought was delightfully entertaining, but sadly I had no hand in it,\" Dancing away, Da Ji fluttered her long eyelashes towards the freed Shennong. \"I have to admit, however. Their methods are enticingly fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see you say that after eating your own medicine! Get her, Shennong!\" Sanzhang dashed behind the amused vixen, locking her elbows with sleeve-covered arms. Understanding his companion's hidden message, the male mystic shot his hands foward to squeeze Da Ji's swaying hips. \"Heehheheheey! Geehheheet her, not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Sanzhang. This wily fox keeps moving too much for me to handle.\" Swaying her body from side to side, the seductress watched with amusement as the male vainly tried to tickle her. With every failed attempt he ended up goosing an unintended rib or tickling Sanzhang's sensitive sides, much to the latter's chagrin. \"I'm trying to hohoohohoold her still! I cahahhahhahaan't keep this up if you're only tickling mehehehheee, and noohohohohoot her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try and remain steady! This aught to do the trick.\" Picking up a stray phoenix plume from their previous opponent's remains, Shennong attempted to swipe it across Da Ji's pale stomach. At the last possible moment, the enchantress of the Orochi faction performed a backflip with incredible dexterity. The doomed feather fluffed across the next available stomach instead; mainly the maiden of Tianzhu's. \"Noohohoahahahaaa! Nohoohhooot aahhhahaagaain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to keep her position, Sanzhang was helpless with giggles to resist being pulled towards an oak. Wrapping her long sleeves around its circumference before tying multiple knots, Da Ji stood in front of a fuming Sanzhang to admire her handiwork. \"How cute. A little mystic girl, all tied up with her own carelessness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me do, Da Ji! I swear I'll-!\" Hearing her empty threats answered by sultry laughter, Sanzhang didn't get her hopes up. Motioning with a finger, one of the enchantress' orbs encompassed Nu Wa's naked feet, while another floated wordlessly to swallow the monk's midriff. \"Let me show you a trick or two I learned from those Djinn. The words I heard in that dastardly illusion... Coochie Coochie Coo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing those three magical phrases, both female mystics let out a gasp. While Nu Wa was the more resilient of the two, her stamina had been drained by earlier battles. With almost synchronized voices, giggles spluttered forth from the mystics' lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why! Hohohoohoow are you doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waahaahahahahaaa?! Why are there feehehheeathes at my behehehheelly again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensation Manipulation. Using my memories as a catalyst, I've imprinted those same feelings onto your very skin.\" Nu Wa howled with hysterical laughter at the uncountable phantom digits scribbling across every expanse of her feet. Similarly, Sanzhang's tears of mirth ran a raging river down her aching cheeks, ghostly phoenix plumes dusting away within the confines of Da Ji's signature weapons. \"The downside is that I must experience the same sensations beforehand once. Aren't you glad I'm sharing it with you now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Release them, vixen.\" Shennong said. Already, his recovered whip wrapped itself around Da Ji's raised hand. Narrowing her eyes, the latter clicked her fingers before turning away from the sound of even more crazed laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you learned the virtue of patience, o'wise plant collector? Or can this concubine teach that lesson with pleasure?\" Da Ji said with a sly tone. Moving to where Shennong was on the ground, she straddled the male whilst licking her lips. \"The proud one's are always the most fun. Ready for your first lesson~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I tame you first, you old fox.\" Shooting out his hands towards Da Ji's slender waist, his favorite squeezing technique earned him husky giggles from her crimson lips. To his surprise, his opponent didn't move away from his grasp. Instead, she plunged her fingers into his robes to mimic his very actions. In a few moments, Shennong was chuckling with boyish snickers despite himself. \"How confident. Is this a battle of wits, theheheheen, or attrition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have your way with my body... if you can withstand own mischief, that is.\" Playfully pinching his lowest rib, Shennong gritted his teeth at the sudden urge to smile. Did her experience in the palace courts give her the knowledge to push his buttons? If so, he was sorely disadvantaged. \"A young newt to a sage. That is how I see this fun playtime, and how it's ensuing end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, Da Ji. A path has many hidden nooks and crannies.\" Wiggling a finger into each of her smooth hollows, Da Ji's hot breath unwillingly sent shivers down his spine as she was forced to lean on him with a case of girlish giggles. \"Some may reveal a treasure trove of hidden surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you are, aren't you? A mystic clad in robes, wrapped in enigma, hiding ticklish nipples.\" Not expecting those last words, Shennong's was caught off-guard at how far the fox's nails had crept up his chest. Giving the pink circles a few scratches, the male mystic was already pouring with boyish laughter like a broken dam. \"Such a sensitive chest. This looks like the perfect spot to draw a few circular curses~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his breathing becoming hectic, Shennong realised the old adage proved to be true, desperate times indeed called for desperate measures. Abandoning her underarms, he hands grabbed the open folds of Da Ji's silky top before pulling them open like curtains. Ignoring the playful gasp, his rough fingers got to work underneath the porcelain globes with fast scribbling and pinching. \"Heehheheey, cut thaahhahaaat out! You cahahahaaan't just jump to theehheheheere yeehehehet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimpse of panic entered Da Ji's eyes. No matter what her previous captor had put her through, she hadn't noticed the sensitivity of her own chest till now. Now unable to do anything but laugh, her hands shakily held herself atop Shennong's grinning smirk as her pride refused any admittance of defeat. Now using that demonizing feather once more, Da Ji threw her head back with hysterical laughter as the tool saw its way both inbetween and underneath her jiggling breasts. \"Can the cunning and sly fox of seduction not stand a little bit of tickling? If I recalled, your very words were... Coochie Coochie Coo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ticklishness almost multiplied by tenfold in her mind, Shennong's teasing words had its intended effect. However, his movements froze as a hand forcefully grabbed onto his pants. Delving its way past the intricate folds, the male mystic dared not move as he felt something inside being forcefully grabbed. After what seemed like an eternity, the seductress slowly held back her remaining giggles, her taunting eyes locked with her opponent's inquisitive orbs. \"What now, Da Ji? Even for your reputation, I doubt your skills at pleasure can save you from this phoenix feather. Kindly remove yourself from me, and we shall discuss your future in our mythical holds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not, Shennong. You see, if its one thing I learnt from my times in courting males,\" Stroking her hand downwards, Shennong had to force himself from responding. Feeling something scratching beneath his shaft, an electrical jolt went up his spine before his mouth curled into a crooked grimace. \"It's that male genitals are oh... so... sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his family jewels a few more scratches, Da Ji's own lips curled into cruel smirk at seeing Shennong's own smirk dissolve into a silly grin. Even though she could feel his thighs shuffling together, she merely kept up the pressure by maintaining a constant motion of scratching his balls. Without any further provocation giggles spluttered without warning from Shennong's mouth. \"I pleeheheheheead with you, Daahhahahaa Ji! You doohoohooon't want to do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I can. And I shall.\" Pulling apart the folds of cloth hiding his member from sight, the shaft sprang up to its full glory within seconds. Whilst Shennong was disgusted with himself at having lust for Da Ji, a small part could never forget the feeling of her soft mounds nor the ticklish skin under his fingertips. Picking up the other discarded phoenix feather, Da Ji mischeviously dusted the tip of Shennong's member. The male arched his back with immediate boyish guffaws, not expecting that area to be ticklish as well. \"Well, well. It seems mystics have ticklish genitallia like regular mortals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawing the bristly fronds along his member like a minuature towel, Shennong's mind blacked out a few times from the immense ticklish sensations. His handsome laughter never stopped, however. \"Dahahahhaaa Ji! Anyweheheheeere but theheheheere! The ten heeeheheheeavens would never forgive mehehehehheee for such a trahaahhahahaavesty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's looking at you, ticklish mystic. Besides,\" Da Ji glanced at where her orbs had ventured on his companions. Nu Wa's tormenting globe had covered her chest, the former rapier-wielding female rolling on the ground with laughter over her discarded top. At the large oaken tree, Sanzhang didn't care for anything else besides giggling as her orb had stuck to a little below her navel. Judging from the furious blushes, husky breathing and slight moans, both divine females were being tickled in areas more than the eye could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've instructed my favourite toys to figure out ways to keep that Sanzhang busy, along with breaking that annoying Nu Wa. Don't you worry at all,\" Da Ji let out another hint of seductive laughter at Shennong's frail attempts to tickle her. With his shaft teased to hell and back, the male mystic's own feather trembled in his hands as he attempted to brush it along her chest. \"While I do enjoy our little time togehehehheether, all things must cohohohooome to an end. Now, wish for itaahahhahaaaa~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herbalist stubbornly clamped his lips at her words. Only by giving his balls a few more tickles did the hysterical Shennong finally relent. \"On this dahahhahaaay and only on this day, I ahahahahaask of you! Reeleleleeease me in your sinful pleehheheheheeasures, Daahahhaaa Ji the seductreheheheheess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you had to do was ask~\" Placing her hands beside his temples, a haze of illusions former in Shennong's willing mind. Surrounded by the numerous beautiful figures of Nu Wa, Sanzhang and Da Ji, his lust took over as they took turns in letting him tickle them, before playfully turning the tables and tickling him. Stroking his fingers along a laughing Nu Wa's thigh, his other hand tickled a giggling Sanzhang's taut bottom whilst a copy of Da Ji giggled seductively from the feathers clutched inbetween his toes, tickling her naked chest. He would never have imagined tickling to be such a creative tool of pleasure. Imagine if the mortals were to discover of its intended purpose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up with his real body, Da Ji gave a victorious grin as she left one last tickle to Shennong's trembling shaft. Leaving the mystic to boyishly giggle in stupor, she turned her attention towards the struggling Nu Wa. Whilst the other female brunette had quietly stayed tied up to her tree in ticklish torment, the light of adversity still glimmered in corners of mystic leader's eyes. \"Tell me, my dear Nu Wa. What shall I ever do about you? Should I deliver you to that remaining Djinn? Or shall I throw you to a Tickledema infested village?\"</span></div></div>",
