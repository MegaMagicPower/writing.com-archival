NOTE That the family is more spread out than thought out, IE the family is centered in New York, Tokyo, New Mexico, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlayers- Evil people that want to destroy humanity <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanderers- They wander the world in solitude just running and fight in self-defence. Can they have allies? Yeah...oh and here is a quick rule, for this one the mutants are just completly diffrent from all the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercs- Mercenary's, quite explanitory until everything goes wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lost- Basically like the family except more bad, but less bad than the slayers, but like the wanderer's they are damn diffrent. Basically the lost are a combination of the family, slayers, and wanderer's. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though Kaz is a part of the family, he is diffrent from the others. Instead of turning in criminals in to the police, he take care's of them himself. There are several members in the family that does this, but out of all he is the deadliest and brutal. He rides his black motorcycle in the street's of Tokyo where he wears all black clothing, has a helmet that is blue with \u9b3c\u5203 (Demon blade) etched into the side with his katana sheathed on his back. Kaz only roams the streets at night and leads a diffrent life at day, as he is very quiet, mysterious, and has the instincts to only fight. How this man got into the family? No one know's, but he is a vigilante that does good and the people of Tokyo have many diffrent views. From being a skiled bladesmen vigilante, to a demon from hell bringing souls that escaped down into the underworld once again, many rumours were started and thus only few know who he really is or what he looks like for the matter. Now let's get back to what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaz was riding in the dark night of Tokyo, where there were still people on the streets, light's flashing, the city was still active. Although in the dark regions, many have fallen to the gangs of Tokyo, from being robbed to organ harvesting, this place has fallen far from it's glory and this man is here to kill the heart. This was when he heard a scream, he rode to where it came from and it was from an alleyway where he spotted 5 men assaulting a young-looking woman. 4 of them had diffrent melee weapons as 1 had a pistol. The men noticed Kaz's arrived and prepared to fight him, but due to the light in their face's they couldn't see who was about to fight them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, bring it on you bitch!\" One of the men taunted. Kaz got off his motorcycle, but still didn't turn off the headlights. He slowly walked toward the 5 men where one charged with an iron pipe and swung, but Kaz caught the pipe and tossed it away as he immediatly unsheathed his blade, slicing the man straight through the middle making the two halves fall in a bloody and gory mess. The 3 men with melee weapons realized who the attacker was and ran off, but the one with the gun was still holding his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's you, I heard about you. Heh, if I kill you here and now my reputation will sky rocket\" The man fired one bullet which Kaz reflected it into a trashcan, he fired again and Kaz reflected it closer to the shooter's foot. The 3rd round was fired and it was deflected into the man's leg. He kneeled down and was about to fire again when Kaz overshadowed him and impaled him straight through his head, a very clean kill. He removed the blade out of the man's head, it was covered in blood and was dripping, he walked away from the alleyway as the assaulted woman lay there on the ground traumatized from what she had seen. Kaz got on his motorcycle and rode off like nothing had ever happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his usual life in Tokyo. Kill gang members and offenders of the law, save the innocent, etc. etc. etc. But that wasn't even half of what he does. Even though he has the potential to be a deadly mercenary, without remorse and with amazing skill, he could be loaded, but that is not Kaz at all, he is trying to fill the emptiness in his heart that happened awhile back, when his actual family was slaughtered and he couldn't do anything about it. He still remembered the one who did it, a slayer named Blood. Thus he killed and killed to get better to do what he couldn't do long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn't mean he is alone, he live's with others that are his new family even though they don't exactly accept his kind of fighting and agenda, but they digress amd accepted him anyway. Kaz was riding back to his apartment since his shift was over, but not without attracting some attention...</span></div></div>",

Get him men!\" One shouted and all of them opened fire, thanks to technilogical innovation, Kaz set his motorcycle to autopilot towards home and turned around with his blade and started blocking and reflecting the oncoming assault of bullethell. What these gang members failed to realize was that, even though they have about 9 guys shooting him with sub-machine guns and automatics, Kaz's reflex ability know's no boundary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kaz it was almost slowing down time to the smallest mili-second as the wave of bullets came at him at once. When a bullet came close, he angled it so it hit certain parts of the car and when he realized that there were just too many bullets at one specific target he just said screw it and time went back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the gang members they were shooting relentlessly trying to kill the one guy, which was a blur with his blade, then one of them noticed the bullet impacts on the car <br>\r\n\"Shit! Everyone sto-\" One of the reflected bullets struck the gunners sticking his head out which made him fall out the window and ragdoll onto the street. Then all 3 attempted to do a pincer manuever, in which they surronded him and then were about to fire when Kaz pulled a Kunai-bomb out of his pocket <br>\r\n\"The sword is not my only weapon\" Kaz said as he threw one at the driver on his left, which impaled him making the car swerving backwards, hitting the car behind him and making an pre-emptive explosion from the kunai, now all that was left was the 3rd car. <br>\r\n\"Shit! Mante, fallback, fallback! This guy is too strong!\" One member said and the car stomped on the brakes and began retreating back. <br>\r\n\"Hmph, strange enough that my reputation doesn't make gang members run and hide instead of coming in numbers to try and kill me\" Then he rode back to his apartment, to his roommates.  </span></div></div>",

There were also large pools of blood all around the place with a few bits and pieces of body parts scattered.<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, what the heck did I miss?\" Kaz questioned as he spotted someone on the roof \"Hey you!\" The figure looked down at him and he pulled out something out of his pocket, it was a piece of paper <br>\r\n\"Okay then, let me see\" The man said, who apparently can be heard even from that far away \"Targets dead: Shadow, blindman, and winder. Remaining targets: Demon blade, speed demon, and Tazer\" He then looked down at Kaz again to gain some recognition on who he is \"Ah right, the demon blade\"<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?!\" Kaz yelled in anger, as he just heard that 3 of his friends were now dead <br>\r\n\"I'm just a guy who was hired these specific targets. Honestly it's nothing personal, but you gotta do, what you gotta do to make a living. Also, I'm no mutant\" <br>\r\n\"If you don't have any abilities...then how the hell did you kill those people?!\" Then the man pulled out a sword-like object that 4 rods coming out of it's hilt and it was glowing white. <br>\r\n\"In about a couple seconds, you'll know how I killed them\" The man then aimed his sword down at Kaz and it began to glow brighter from the hilt to the end of the sword. Well, it is clear that whoever this person was had some sort of laser built into his sword, though it's abilities are slightly unknown it is clear that it is strong enough to take out 3 of his comrades, whom were no pushovers in the slightest. So, does Kaz run with his tailpipe between his legs or just fights?</span></div></div>",

I was just an ordinary person with an ordinary life and ordinary family and friends. I knew that I was prepared for some worst case scenario's, but nothing like this...just nothing like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when I approached a large roadblock guarded by military personel for some reason. I came up to one MP and said,<br>\r\n\"Why is this roadblock here?\" The MP just stared intimidatley, but I wasn't shaken<br>\r\n\"We are just packing up an old scientist's work, the guy has gone off the deep end, now that is all I can say to you citizen, now leave the premises, there is nothing for you to see here\" The MP responded and I began to walk off when I saw another MP walk up to him and whisper something into his ear, now I couldn't hear their conversation and continued walking until I felt something hard hit me in the back of my head, I fell down onto the pavement with a thud and blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed for days I woke up with an extreme headache and felt numb and saw that I was in some sort of labratory with some others on examining tables, some looked odd and inhumane while others were connected by wires and other things. I looked around more to see some more military personel and scientist's lurking around the room looking at chemicals and computer screens. That was when a female scientist came at my side <br>\r\n\"Ah you're awake, I was wondering when you were going to get up, hey you, assistant, get the serum we have a new test subject! Now don't worry now, this won't hurt at all...I think\" The scientist still was there as the assistant came with a cart full of serums and needles. <br>\r\n\"Oh crap I do not like where this is going!\" I yelled and struggled to get free, then I was electrocuted with a cattle prod by the scientist<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, there is no escape for you my pretty, now which serum to use...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you pick your gender which actually matters on the type of power you get<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Delvin<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nHeight: 5'6<br>\r\nweight:163<br>\r\nbuild: Actually a bit chubby (But not that much)  <br>\r\nHair: brown, medium, scruffy <br>\r\neye: brown <br>\r\nrace: Hispanic<br>\r\nAbility???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen Gnat <br>\r\nAge:16<br>\r\nheight:5'8<br>\r\nweight:135<br>\r\nbuild: Slight <br>\r\nhair: Blond ponytail (Nope not dumb at all) <br>\r\neye: green<br>\r\nrace: white<br>\r\nAbility???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are wondering the eye color is a hint at their possible ability<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several moments later I felt something tingle inside my stomach and then the next thing I know I felt a sharp pain all around my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- *POV of the assistant*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the effects of the chemical on the test subject, he was having spasm's, there was foam forming around his mouth, and he was screaming in pain as I saw that his entire body was changing. The skin of his body began falling off as a brownish rock-like subtance replaced it, not only that but he was getting bigger and I think he was breaking out of the binds. <br>\r\n\"Security, SECURITY!\" The MP that were inside of the room and outside in the hall all went around the mutating test subject, all around I counted 16 with varied weapons only meant to stun and subdue, but there were a couple that had guns. The examination table the test subject was on began to crack then fell apart to the mutant's immense weight. The subject stood up and I could see his humanoid golem-like body, everypart of his body appeared stone-like and he stood higher the biggest MP in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----back to Robert <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw that I overshadowed everyone in the room, my head was inches away from the ceiling, and I looked at my hands and arms to see that I was turned into a rock monster. I stared at all of the MP's and some looked scared and several others seemed excited from either seeing action after so long or are that sadistic. <br>\r\n\"What did you do to me!?\" I yelled, my voice seemed rough and coarse, but it still had the angry affect<br>\r\n\"Shit! He's aggravated, fire, fire, FIRE!\" One of the MP's commanded and every single one fired their tasers, dart guns, and even one charged ahead and smashed a stun rod on my crotch , but even that didn't do anything at all since it didn't even go through my rock skin <br>\r\n\"Well that did shit, anyone got a real gun?\" The MP that stun roded my crotch questioned as I kicked him hard enough to hear the bones crack and his body flying across the room into a patient, all of the MP's gasped and one of them grabbed their shotgun and blasted me in the chest, it may not have broke the rock, but I did feel the sting.<br>\r\n\"We need bigger guns\" </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">*Can there be some sort of X-men thing? Eh...maybe*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor many years people have existed in the world that have extroardinary abilities that make them who they are today. Since the medival ages, those who shown any signs of being one of these beings were demons or witches and were hunted down until they were dead. This is basically what it is today, some people are hunted down because of their ability, some are on freak shows, some are shunned by the community, and there are several others who had enough and decided to have revenge. While that happened some were idolized for good deeds, some had good lives, and others were vigilante's. In the mutant world there are several factions, the family who is a group of mutant-only (Sometimes they make exceptions) people who live together and do good. The slayers who are mutants that are damn pissed off at humanity and wish to destroy it. The wanderer's who are people who just run and wander across the world, running from people and fight mostly in self-defense. The Mercs who are mutants that are hired to the highest and do whatever they are told to do. And finally the lost, who are mutants who have lost their way and result in thievery and all that. Very similiar to the family except that they are bad. By the way, how they obtainted their ability might be a military experiment, radiation, or some sort of biological mutation or hell I don't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. You can curse all you want, you can add as much gore or blood, and you can do whatever you want with the characters, just stick to the people's karmatic destiny...oh wait *Remembers Infamous* <br>\r\n2. Erotic and vore, both just keep it minimal<br>\r\n3. If you are adding just have good spelling and grammer, I do not want grammar nazi's banging on my front door <br>\r\n4. Otherwise go nuts, oh and it can end with death or some sort of final experiance thing. <br>\r\n5. Oh and for anthros and aliens...yes there can be aliens...but it might be a little away from the story altogether, but for anthros...just do something like a military experiment or something along those lines and it will be okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: I have forgotten something. People who seemingly have simple powers such as strength and reflex alone can mearely be the surface of what they can do...if it is what they do all-around than they suck royally, which the only thing good about this is that it's very easy to maintain/control and will improve. Those with better powers...well you might guess what they did. </td>",
