Some of the sand went into Nana's (the female Ice Climber's) mouth. She stared, then she smiled. \"Hey! This stuff tastes like Pixie Stix!\" She took a few more bites, and realized that it practically WAS Pixie Stix! The others began testing the rest of the island, and realised that it was made entirely out of sweets, which imediately replenished after being bitten off and such. Link came up with an interesting idea then: \"Why don't we see how much we can gain while we wait to be rescued?\" Everyone agreed to it. </span></div></div>",

She would eat some bites of the hot fudge mud and then ponder how the Chozo( the bird like statue things that raised her) would react to her gain. Although, she was getting some interesting looks from King Dedede, Snake, and Captain Falcon. She would hobble over and lean on a tree to try and get more of those looks, and it seemed to be working, but she didn't much care for Snake.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Samus, do you, uh, want this Nutty Bar?\" King Dedede asked nervously.<br>\r\n\"Sure, King. Its hard to find those things here. Thanks!\" She replied happily accepting the chocolate wafer bar.<br>\r\nCaptain Falcon got a little jealous that the penguin got first dibs on Samus. He desperately started looking for something to give her. He grabbed a sugar cookie sand dollar.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sammy! Have this!\" He offered kindly.<br>\r\nShe grabbed the cookie and marveled at how it sparkled in the sun. She bit into it. It tasted sweet like swallowing five spoonfuls of sugar with light fluffy cotton. Her mouth watered as she took a second bite into the delectable cookie.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmmm... Thank you....\" She moaned.<br>\r\nSnake knew he couldn't out do those gifts, so he ran back to the ship. He searched around in the cargo hold until he saw Samus's bags. He opened it and searched around.<br>\r\n\"Whoo! Not what I was looking for...\" He said as he lifted some bras out of the bag. \"Not that either!\" He giggled as he pulled out her under wear. \"C'mon! Were's that Metroid of her's at!\"</span></div></div>",

MY CHOCOLATE MARSHMALLOW EGGS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT KEEP ME ALIVE!!!!!\" Daisy screeched.<br>\r\nToad started crying out of fear. Peach grabbed him and cradled him in her arms. Toad blushed at his princesses huge breasts. He started fake crying to see what she would do.<br>\r\n\"Awww... Poor Toady Woady... Shame on you Daisy! How dare you make my wittle baby cry!\" Peach scolded smacking Daisy upside the head.<br>\r\n\"Guys! Look! It's the ginger bread people! Zelda squealed!<br>\r\nPeach tossed Toad and ran into the small village.<br>\r\nAll the princesses ran and pushed their way in. The villagers came out and pointed and stared at them. A giant gingerbread man with red and blue icing came walking towards them. He had two other slittly smaller ginger people following close behind. He poked and prodded at the princesses.<br>\r\n\"HELLO! MY NAME IS PRINCESS TOADSTOOL! YOU CAN CALL ME PEACH! WE COME IN PEACE AND SEARCH FOR THE CHOCOLATE SPA!\" Peach said roboticly and very slowly using various hand gestures. <br>\r\nThe gingermen started group rummbling.<br>\r\n\"Choco choco! Peety peety yum yum! Shasta stew yum yum!\" One of them yelled rubbing his stomach. The group broke out in laughter and copying him.<br>\r\nAn older looking one started bowing down and speeking.<br>\r\n\"Moracka sho shava do le llamaa!\" He chanted bowing down to the monarchs. The rest of the group gasped and started bowing and chanting with him. The king led them to an entirley chocolate area.<br>\r\nIt had a chococuzie and a massagelate, and maniclates and chocledies. There were even chcolate grass, trees, and waterfalls! The girls jumped into the chococuzie and had the gingermen give them chocledies and manilates.<br>\r\n\"It feels like I'm makin love with Willy Wonka!\" Zelda groaned as the jets pushed warm chocolate around them.<br>\r\n\"Girl, how would you even know what that feels like?\" Daisy asked licking some chocolate as a gingerman gave her a back rub.<br>\r\n\"It's just a guess at what it feels like,\" Zelda retorted calmly.<br>\r\nToad stood there in disbeilief. 'She actually picked cookies over ME?!' He thought. A ginger man ran up and looked at him. Toad bit his head off in anger.<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",
