A friend of yours had told you where you could watch the sun set that was just beyond a grove of apple trees. It was supposed to be beautiful. You thought that you would be having a good time camping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, on the drive over to where the woods were, the map blew out of the window and now you found yourself wandering all about the forest trying to make heads or tails of where you were. It was trying you up a wall as you slam your head on the table and let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust beyond the grove of apple trees,\u201d you grunt. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an apple tree around for miles. Why did I lose that stupid map. Dammit!\u201d You pound your fist on a nearby rock and then groan as you shake your hand. \u201cOh great,\u201d you say. \u201cWhat else could go wrong. Screw this, I\u2019m getting out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as you look back, you see that you don\u2019t even recognize the path where you came in and from the looks of it, you were lost. You slap yourself in the face. \u201cNow that\u2019s just great.\u201d You moan to yourself. What you needed was a compass. It would\u2019ve helped if you brought one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse your bad luck and carelessness as you\u2019re wandering through the forest. You even kick at something that looks like a piece of fruit. Then you stop and you look down. \u201cHuh?\u201d you mutter. You look and gasp because you see that on the ground was a pear of some kind. But it was the wrong color. It was blue. You had never heard of a blue pear and you reach down to pick it up. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see several oddly colored trees with more unusual fruit, such as blue lemons, pink apples and red bananas. You run in, wondering what is going on and soon you find yourself\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mountain looked jagged and from the looks of it, it was one of two mountains and the ways the mountains were shaped made them look like a pair of curved horns. \u201cOkay,\u201d you say. \u201cNow things are really starting to get weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you realized something. Climbing up the mountain might be to your advantage. You could probably get a good view of where you are and find your way out of the forest so you could go home. Wasting no time you start to climb the mountain. As you do, you see several trees with more of those unusual fruit such as green peaches, white cherries, pink kiwis and even some gray colored durians with strange spirals on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you see that the trees seem to be obscuring a village of some kind. You\u2019d say something that looked like a mix of South American, ancient Chinese and African structure, but you couldn\u2019t be one hundred percent sure what you were seeing because the trees blocked everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour you reach the top of the mountain and look out. But to your horror the forest just went on and on and there seemed to be no end in sight to the trees all around. \u201cOh no,\u201d you groan. \u201cClimbing this damn mountain got me nowhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kick a few rocks you hear somebody speaking in a strange language that didn\u2019t sound like any language from Earth. At least, not any that you recognize. Then you turn around and see a female anthropomorphic...</span></div></div>",

She appeared to have bright blue lips and green hair reaching to her long tail and large hips and she appeared to be wearing a scaly Chinese looking two piece dress before she flew down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back as the dragoness lands on a large rock and then stares down on you. She appears to be inspecting you as she stretches her neck down and then sniffs at you. She gives a snort and you step back as flames appear briefly out of her nose. The dragon also appears to be wagging her tail as she looks at you. You have no idea what this dragon wants. Does she want to eat you? No, those are European dragons. She\u2019s clearly an eastern dragon. As opposed to barbaric western dragons, eastern dragons are known for being patient, wise and kind-hearted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what you heard. But this dragon woman looked suspicious. She was sniffing around you and you could hear motion coming from her insides. Heck, you can even hear a heartbeat coming from yourself and it was very loud. You wonder if that dragon is the leader of whatever creatures live in this area. You heard that dragons were revered as gods in China. Perhaps that dragon was a queen or chief, because you\u2019re not sure that she could be a goddess. You don\u2019t even know if this dragon could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she rises up and stands in front of you, right before she...</span></div></div>",

You have to dive out of the way as that flaming object comes down and scorches the mountainside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around in horror because there is fire everywhere and then you turn to see a 6-foot tall and extremely pear-shaped figure that is wreathed in pink fire standing atop a large rock. The flames were brighting bright and you see that the mysterious figure even has some form of beak-like face and appears to be feminine in appearance. Her eyes are glowing bright and then she opens up her wings You shield yourself as she flaps her wings and creates a small cyclone that extinguishes the fire around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see that with the flames in the area put out, the mysterious creature had extinguished the flames that she was wreathed in and you see that she is a pear-shaped humanoid phoenix woman with bright pink and white feathers and from the looks of it, she also had D-cup breasts and long golden blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it. It would be strange enough to encounter a normal anthropomorphic animal, but this was no ordinary animal.

You hear some strange noises coming from the opening and step back. But then you also hear louder noises that sounding like shouting in some strange unintelligible language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to know where those strange noises were coming from or what was making them and quickly run inside the cave. You gasp and pant. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there,\u201d you say. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t intend to find out. I\u2019ll just wait in here until they\u2019re completely gone and then\u2026 what the huh?\u201d you see some strange writing on the wall as well as strange images that seemed to depict ancient people in strange costumes but from the looks of it they didn\u2019t resemble any kind of human you could recognize. They almost looked like animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this strange place?\u201d You ask. You walk further down the cave and take out a flashlight to see where you\u2019re going. At least you remembered to bring that with you. As you continue your walk down the cave, you see what look like unlit torches on the wall and on a rock there appears to be cutlery of some kind. You were beginning to think you stumbled upon the ruins of some ancient civilization. It would be an amazing discovery if you were an archaeologist, which you aren\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you realize something. That cutlery looks like it was made recently.

There definitely was something not right about this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dousing your face a few times, you shake it off and inhale deeply.

She seemed nervous and her knees were even knocking. She accidentally bumps the rock that you're standing on with her hips and causes you to drop with a large splash into the water. You sputter as you're floating in the water and see that it was much deeper than it looked and there appeared to be some sort of trench at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't thing about what was laying below the water because you looked up to see the sea lion girl's legs flapping in front of you and her large flippered feet that moved about in a hypnotic motion.

As it steps out of the river, water still dripping down its massive form, you realize just how <i>massive</i> it is; at least 10 or 11 feet tall. What's more, it's, well, <i>very</i> much a female. She's totally nude, with wide hips and thighs as thick as small tree trunks with an ass that could easily cover you entirely, a massive plump belly, and a humongous pair of breasts that are each easily larger than your entire torso, all on a figure that's nicely padded out with a layer of soft flab underlain with noticeable toned muscles, you suddenly find your shorts feeling entirely too tight for your growing erection. A tiny hippo tail flicks at an insect from its position just about the hippo-woman's massive jiggling rear, and her hands and feet each end in three thick digits, all ending in thick almost hoof-like nails. Now that you look more closely at her head, you notice that her features are a bit softer, more rounded than the hippos you've seen in zoos and in books, but as she yawns and stretches her arms out, sticking out her immense chest even more, you see that she still definitely has the vicious tusks and fangs of a real hippopotamus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your obvious arousal at the sight of the hippopotamus woman, you decide to beat a hasty retreat from this place. You've read about what hippos can do to humans, and you don't want to stick around long enough to see what a ten-foot-tall one will do to you when she realizes that you were spying on her while she was naked. You slowly begin to back away....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for a stick to noisily snap underneath your foot.

Around this time every year, humans like you are lost in the woods and the amazons around here have the only opportunity for the whole year to satisfy more.... carnal desires. But men are so brittle compared to us and so we often have to resort to force and trickery, to get what we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then gasp.

A friend of yours had told you where you could watch the sun set that was just beyond a grove of apple trees. It was supposed to be beautiful. You thought that you would be having a good time camping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unfortunately, on the drive over to where the woods were, the map blew out of the window and now you found yourself wandering all about the forest trying to make heads or tails of where you were. It was trying you up a wall as you slam your head on the table and let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust beyond the grove of apple trees,\u201d you grunt. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an apple tree around for miles. Why did I lose that stupid map. Dammit!\u201d You pound your fist on a nearby rock and then groan as you shake your hand. \u201cOh great,\u201d you say. \u201cWhat else could go wrong. Screw this, I\u2019m getting out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as you look back, you see that you don\u2019t even recognize the path where you came in and from the looks of it, you were lost. You slap yourself in the face. \u201cNow that\u2019s just great.\u201d You moan to yourself. What you needed was a compass. It would\u2019ve helped if you brought one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You curse your bad luck and carelessness as you\u2019re wandering through the forest. You even kick at something that looks like a piece of fruit. Then you stop and you look down. \u201cHuh?\u201d you mutter. You look and gasp because you see that on the ground was a pear of some kind. But it was the wrong color. It was blue. You had never heard of a blue pear and you reach down to pick it up. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then see several oddly colored trees with more unusual fruit, such as blue lemons, pink apples and red bananas. You run in, wondering what is going on and soon you find yourself\u2026</span></div></div>",
