The threat coming from beyond the stars in the form of monstrous biomechanical organisms with calculating abilities that put earth's greatest computers to shame and armaments befitting battleships. Yet with all of this destructive power and incredible calculating ability, they are able to traverse our landscape with ease within there metallic, armored bodies. Having created the perfect bond or organism and machine, wielding guns and blades the size of cars and patio furniture, it seemed as though it wasn't a matter of if humankind would fall, but rather a matter of when. With the few remaining military forces spread so thin and wide, nations of all sorts began to work to form a new military force known as the Global Defense Force. The organization and reformation of the worlds armed forces under this new organization saw several victories and were now able to hold their ground against the alien attackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Daunted by the newly formed defense force and angered by the sudden spike in resistance, the commander of the alien military force launched the following global transmission-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hear me humans! We are the Novarai! You, who have inherited the third planet in this solar system, have no true claim to this land. You're 'human spirit' as you call it is nothing more than an ideal without substance, fueling a delusion of grandeur that has made you believe that you can deny us our victory. You, like so many other worlds before you, will fall. This planet, like the planets that we've conquered before it, will serve our needs. Further conflict and resistance will only delay the inevitable, surrender now and we will be merciful and treat you as a valued workforce. Continue to defy us, and we will crush you into submission! We leave the choice with you, this will be the first and only offer you will receive from us... I suggest you take it. Know that from this point forward, should you refuse our offer, we will deploy our full arsenal against you and we will not hesitate to strike you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not surprisingly, after a large debate, the GDF continued the fight. True to their word, the Novarai began an onslaught of attacks that were more intense and merciless than any before. Yet, through imaginative tactics and ingenuity, the human race was able to hold their ground and stay in the fight. This impressed some of the soldiers within the Novarai forces. Some of those who were impressed, had seen their enemy. Men and women, children and adults... cut down, shot down or captured on the battlefield. They had seen their enemy and felt remorse, \"Where in their noble quest did they become pillagers and plunderers?\" They wondered. After a few more months of watching the humans continue to fight for their right to exist and for their homes and families a small group of Novarai decided that protecting humanity meant more to them than their formerly noble cause. With the help of fellow sympathizers, four Novarai warriors left their forward command base and began to seek out the humans the fought so desperately to protect their world. The warriors knew that as they were, they would not be able to help the humans very much in the fight against their former allies. But after seeing the imagination and ingenuity that the humans had displayed, they knew that if such thinking was paired with their physical and technological advantages... then the humans might stand a chance of winning the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each warrior found a human base. Understandably, the humans weren't very eager to accept help from their would be saviors. But the warriors refused to give up on making the humans understand. They surrendered themselves to the humans even to the point of allowing their armor to be removed and allowing their bodies to be examined. What the humans found was unthinkable. Wiring and muscle tissue grafted together. A generator and a heart molded into one, forming a power core. Electronic eyes plugged into a nervous system. It was then that the GDF realized what they were up against. After finally gaining the trust of the skeptical humans, the warriors proposed a radical and drastic plan of action. They explained that humanity had the ability to win the war but not the means. Offering their own bodies up as the means, they recommended that they be refitted so that a human pilot could be placed in the core of the Novarai body and literally fight as one with the warrior. By forming a neural link the pilot and Novarai warrior would be able to share subconscious thought, instincts and reactions. And while the pilot would handle the general movement and combat of the Novarai, the Novarai warrior would still have to move its body in conjunction with the pilot in order to complete or initiate movements that would be too fast for the pilot to input via the controls. Reluctantly, the GDF agreed after contacting its bases where the other Novarai warriors had surrendered themselves, seeing this as the only way to turn the tide of the war. So the overhauls and refits on the Novarai began. But through the entire process, they were forced to wonder, who would pilot them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ok! That's the story! The stage is set for you, the reader. If you're having trouble imagining what the Novarai look like, just imagine something similar to the 'unicorn gundam'. Not exactly the same but that's the concept, at twenty feet tall round about. The question is, which of these future pilot's will you follow?</span></div></div>",

An old boot splashed through a puddle of still water followed closely by a raggedy sneaker. The owners of the footwear fleeing from danger along the slanted sidewalks San Francisco was famous for. An explosion tour a nearby townhouse apart, throwing the two desperate survivors to the unforgiving pavement. The wearer of the sneakers was the first to get up, brushing her long black hair out of her eyes she raised her gun's sights to one of her piercing green eyes. She waited for her target to walk into the range of her weapon. The ground trembled slightly with each step her target took until out of the smoke and dust walked a Novarai. It's electronic eyes were hidden by the jet black visor that sat above its mask. It's mask itself looked like something akin to a diving regulator, and its body was somewhat bulky and rather unimpressive other than the actual armor and it's size. In one hand it carried what looked like a single shot rifle, and in the other it held a blade of some sort. It looked almost like an enlogated and oversized arrowhead. The human squeezed her trigger letting a stream of rounds fly right into the Novarai's face. The metal menace paused as if expecting something more to happen. By then, the second human got up, reaching into the satchel he wore he drew out a black cylinder about the size of a flashlight before pulling a ring off of it and hurling it at the Novarai's visor. He then turned his back to the Novarai before covering his eyes while his counterpart simply tipped the bill of her hat down to shield her eyes from the impending explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A loud bang split the air, the cylinder was engulfed in a small white explosion that was barely larger than it itself. The Novarai staggered backwards in surprise before looking away from where the cylinder had exploded. It's normally clear vision pixilated and filled with static, its audio receptors producing feedback. Unable to operate the mechanical hunter had to remain where it was for the moment as its systems restored themselves. After all, it had heard of instances like this before from its fellow Novarai brethren and from what it knew, this would only be a temporary setback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several blocks away a pair of boots stomped to a stop while the following sneakers lazily dragged their soles until they were no longer moving. The owner of the boots panted as he brushed some dust out of his short, brown hair and straightened his glasses, \"How... How are you not blind and deaf right now?\" He panted looking to the woman he was with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shrugging hear shoulders she took a pair of rubber earplugs out of her ears and adjusted her baseball cap, \"earplugs from the gun range apparently work quite well for flashbangs too. And my hat seemed to be a good enough shield for my eyes at the time, turns out I was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man through a hand through the air in disbelief, \"Whatever, we should get moving again before that thing comes around the corner and kills us,\" He suggested as he straightened his raggedy grey t shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Relax Zack, it's not trying to kill us. It wants to capture us,\" The woman replied as she unzipped her denim jacket while fanning herself with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah, that makes it so much better,\" Zack snapped, \"How do you know that anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Straightening out her heart shaped necklace, she shrugged again, \"If it really wanted to kill us it would have shot us instead of the building next to us. It probably would have killed us both when I shot it in the face too instead of hesitating. And then it just doesn't make since to send a single Novarai to a deserted city to kill two humans when they're in the middle of a massive rampage on Las Vegas... just what I figure anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zack blinked in disbelief, \"When did you have the time to think of all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The woman threw her hands up, \"Just now,\" She replied non-chalantly. A few moments after she finished talking, the sound of heavy metal footsteps could be heard in the distance. \"Guess we'd better move it or lose it.\" She then started walking in a random direction along the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, Sarah! Where are ya going?\" Zach asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turned to face him while walking backwards and reloading the gun that hung from her right shoulder, \"This way, away from that Novarai,\" She replied casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zack sighed and followed, \"Not quite the answer I was trying to get but at least she's headed away from that thing,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching up with her, the pair turn a corner and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several bodies were strewn around the trailer, the pavement on the street had been ravaged along with nearby buildings. \"It looks like there was a heck of a fight here to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah scratched her head puzzled by the sight, \"Yeah... but why'd they attempt to protect this trailer. And a better question I think is why did the Novarai leave the goods behind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zach took another look at the trailer. The damage was pretty severe, but whatever was inside had somehow managed to survive underneath the rubble that was formerly the roof of the trailer. \"You're right, whatever they were moving is still in there and since the back of the trailer says wide load, I'm going to bet its pretty big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let's go check it out,\" Sarah suggested as she started walking towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woah, hey! Wait a minute, that could be a nuclear bomb ticking away its last ten seconds for all we know!\" Zach warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then there's no point in running and we'll die quickly and painlessly,\" Sarah replied with a lopsided smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've... gotta find myself some new friends,\" Zach muttered with a confused and disturbed expression painted on his face. Zach started to follow Sarah when he decided that he'd rather keep his distance than poke a metaphorical bear with a stick, \"Actually, you go check it out and I'll be a lookout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatever floats your boat,\" Sarah casually replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah climbed into what was left of the trailer and began removing some of the rubble. As she cleared away several pieces of debris she found something unexpected (Ok, maybe you expected it but she didn't). A black Novarai laying on its back, the teal, oval shaped, glass like lenses that made up its eyes stared blankly at the sky. The featureless mask that sat beneath its eyes seemed to add an element of mystery to its persona while a teardrop helmet sat at the top of its head with the pointed end facing its back. Its sleek armor made it seem ahead of its time, even for a Novarai. The most notable feature of this Novarai though, was the large opening in its torso. Several panels and much of the framework had been opened up to reveal a piloting position. Two joysticks sat at the ends of the armrests on either side. A harness sat attached to a back rest and two pedals, one for each leg were found housed lower down in each of the Novarai's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"I wonder if this is one of those top secret Meta Frames that people were spreading rumors about... If it is, I might be able to pilot it and find us a way out of this dump....\"</i> Sarah thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, Sarah! We've got a problem!\" Zach shouted as he ran toward his fellow survivor. \"Two Novarai are headed right for- Wait, is that a Novarai that you're standing on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It used to be, now it's a weapon made by humans, for humans,\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, and I'm a magic fairy.

It seemed as though their only interest was in leveling the city. There were however, those who would resist. An explosion knocked one of the Novarai down as it marched down the street. Upon regaining it's footing it found itself weathering a storm of bullets as a group of human freedom fighters sprayed it down with their automatic weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pathetic...\" The Novarai boomed as it's chest opened vertically in the center to display a missile rack among it's muscle tissue and metallic frame. Knowing what was about  to come next, the freedom fighters fled the streets in an effort to clear the blast zone. \"Be gone...\" The Novarai commanded as it fired a volley of missiles. A fireball tore through the street, incinerating everything in its path. All that remained were the superheated ruins of a few cars and lamp posts other than the scorched road itself. What few humans were caught in the blast were incinerated instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You monster!\" A feminine voice called out from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Novarai was only able to look up and catch an impression of a humanoid shadow before a blue blur crashed into it. Smashed into a cold metal corpse beneath the feet of its attacker, the Novarai remained motionless. Rising from the cloud of smoke and dust was a blue Novarai figure. It's body was agile and almost fragile looking. A long rather reptilian tell protruded from its backside. It's head had a perforated mask covering the lower section of its face while a single green, diamond shaped eyed sat just above the faceplate. The rest of it's head was covered by some sort of helmet that seemed to be integrated with the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We were too late,\" A dejected and clearly robotic feminine voice declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, we can still prevent any more lives from being lost!\" A second voice declared. It was also feminine, but it was higher pitched and carried the natural tone of a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two silver Novarai moved to intercept the blue one. \"You will be eliminated as an enemy of the Novarai cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside of the blue Novarai, a human woman gritted her teeth, \"You will be eradicated because nobody likes you! Sealure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am ready to engage,\" The robotic voice replied. With frightening speed, the blue giant closed the distance between it and it's attackers. Tackling the first one to the ground she thrusted a clawed metallic hand through the metal coated chest of her first victim. Within seconds the steel monsters struggles were halted. The second Novarai turned and drew its sidearm before firing several shots at its enemy. Sealure; the blue machine leapt up into the air several feet before digging her claws into the side of a sky scraper to suspend herself above the impending attack. Her opponent raised its gun to line up another shot with his prey and fired as Sealure leapt from the building to one on the opposing side of the street where she again kept herself suspended above her enemy. This time, however, as her opponent turned to open fire on her she released her grip on the building to draw a small side arm of her own from the side of her thigh. She fired two shots from her weapon causing the attacking Novarai to reel backwards before she rushed up to it and grabbed its face in a crushing grip with her left hand while firing several shots through it's body with the weapon in her right hand. The Novarai remained motionless until Sealure released it from her grip and allowed it to fall to the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If only we could have gotten here sooner,\" Sealure muttered, her mechanical voice dripping with guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We did the best we could,\" The pilot assured the Novarai as she flexed her left hand in its interface prompting Sealure to mirror the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm aware... but still....\" The Novarai continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We can discuss it more when we get you back to the hangar during you're maintenance check, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very well...\" The city's blue savior then turned and began walking north where her air transport awaited her.</span></div></div>",

However, Sealure was not the only Novarai in the hangar. A second machine, colored white and purple stood dormant on the opposing side of the hangar supported by a service gantry. As Sealure stepped backward into her gantry, Terra couldn't help but quietly stare at the second Novarai. Several workers continued to work tirelessly on the metallic giant; welding panels and installing hydraulics. What the finished product would look like was impossible to tell given there was a tarp covering part of it and several of the external cowling and armor panels had yet to be put into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It seems Gato is nearly finished with her retrofit...\" Sealure observed as she opened her cockpit.

I'm do for maintenance at 15:20 hours anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra nodded to the mech before giving her a wave, \"Alrighty then, I'll see you later...

Terra entered the tower before ascending to the command deck in one of the two elevators. Upon reaching the upper level she found her commander issuing orders while updating an electronic map that showed the movements and deployments of both Novarai and human forces. As she approached, she couldn't help but wonder how accurate the intel was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander; a middle aged gentleman from England, turned to see Terra approaching him, \"Ah, Terra! Just returned from your sortie I take it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fresh from the hangar,\" Terra replied with a small smile and a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Splendid! I heard from our observers that you did a bang up job taking out those Novarai...\" He added as he moved a blue dot on the screen from one spot to another after glancing at a sheet of paper in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sealure made it easy for me,\" Terra replied plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The commander stopped and turned to face the pilot, \"Something tells me that you and Sealure don't feel as successful as the reports say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra sighed, \"A group of human resistance fighters engaged the Novarai before we could and it wiped pretty much all of them out, save for a few stragglers that were lucky enough to avoid the attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" The commander nodded, \"But, you must carry on, don't let it weigh to heavily upon your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sir?\" Terra asked, \"How can you say that? Those people died!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm... They did. But they did so knowing that there was a high chance of that result <i>after</i> we expressly warned them against engaging the enemy. We also told them that we were sending you to aid them. Yet, in the end they decided that they wanted to fight for humanity in their own way with or without our help. All we can do is respect their decision and save as many lives in the future as we can...\" The commander then placed a hand on the young woman's shoulder, \"Your mission was a success, don't let anyone; including yourself tell you anything different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra smiled and nodded, \"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And call me Charles, I detest formalities when they aren't necessary. We're all soldiers fighting the same enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes sir- I mean Charles....\" Terra chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very good then,,,, Is there anything else?\" Charles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually, I wanted to know how finding a pilot for Gato was going?\" Terra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Charles sighed and furrowed his brow, \"That Novarai is more temperamental and demanding than anything or one I have ever encountered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She can't be that bad...\" Terra laughed, \"I know her personality needs some work but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not just her personality,\" Charles explained, \"It's her physical and mental expectations and her design.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra gave the Englishman a perplexed look, \"I don't follow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Gato was designed to be a mid to close range ground combat unit and she still will be when the refit is finished. Long range combat for her will depend on how much she can physically carry and her pilot's skill depending on the weapon chosen for long ranged combat. The problem is that Gato is largely driven by her personal feelings as well as her physical combat capabilities. More often times than not she'll pit herself in extreme close range combat with her opponents, forcing the pilot to attempt to keep up with her both mentally and physically. We still haven't found a pilot that has been able to endure the fast paced and constant combat style she uses. And the ones that can endure, can't keep up. They just end up making her stumble around the battlefield and every simulation ends with her frustrated and the pilot exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds like we need to broaden our search for her pilot,\" Terra mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you find someone who you think fits the build be sure to give me a ring will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Will do,\" Terra replied as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\"></div>Terra was on her way to her room when a thought struck her, <i>\"I need to know more about the potential pilots we have on hand... Looking over the simulator logs and replays wouldn't be a bad place to start.\"</i> She then turned on her heel and and made a beeline for the simulator room. The simulators were basically pods that allowed a pilot to train to be in a simulated Novarai cockpit or H.A.N (Human Assisted Novarai). In addition, the system allowed any HAN to connect to the simulator and fight with the pilot in simulated battles. As Terra walked into the simulation bay, she noted that three of the pods were offline and being examined by technicians. <i>\"Odd, I didn't think overhaul day was for another week...\"</i> The pilot thought as she climbed a flight of stairs and entered the control room. Inside the room she found two technicians working busily on the electronics that made the system work. \"Hey guys, having technical issues?\" Terra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Security issues... We think someone without access has been using the simulators,\" One of the techs replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra's face scrunched up in confusion, \"How are they getting past the front door? There's cameras all around the external entry points and three senior techs are on duty at all times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To be honest, we don't know. We don't even have an idea of what he or she looks like...\" The second tech replied. \"All we have is the combat data from the simulations they ran. No idea when they were here or when they actually left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You couldn't even I.D. them? How is that possible, shouldn't the internal camera inside the pod catch their face?\" Terra asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It did, the first time at least... but whoever it was wore a mask to keep themselves hidden. But now the camera won't even pick up an image anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This isn't an outside job... someone on this base who knows the system and the protocols is doing this,\" Terra muttered.... \"Can I see the combat data?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the two techs nodded and left his station to pull up the data on another monitor. Terra read over the numbers, as she did her face changed from thoughtful to shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have you seen these numbers yet?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We did, and we thought it was a glitch... until we played back the footage,\" The tech replied as he punched a button on the keyboard to bring up the video. Terra watched as a gray yellow simulation of a concept HAN fought two enemy Novarai. Weilding a submachine gun, the HAN fired a volley of rounds at the two Novarai while charging them. The first Novarai fired a set of missles at the HAN. In a fluid motion the human piloted machine dropped from its sprint and onto its back to slide under the incoming missiles while releasing a spray of bullets into the air to destroy them. As the yellow mech slid to a stop a shadow fell over it. One of the opposing Novarai had closed the gap and prepared to fire what seemed to be some sort of laser rifle. The yellow machine responded by kicking the tip of its opponents gun skyward sending the beam blasting harmlessly into the sky, the yellow combatant then fired its submachine gun into its aggressor's torso. The gray novarai stumbled backwards before dropping to one knee. The sound of machine gun fire filled the air until a continuous clicking noise was all that could be heard. The yellow clad fighter had run out of ammunition. The second Novarai, which had kept its distance initially drew a blue, luminescent, sword like blade before charging the yellow HAN. The yellow unit threw it's empty rifle at the charging enemy as it rose to its feet only for the Novarai to shrug at it off like a meager annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra turned her head without taking her eyes off of the screen, \"They didn't have a spare clip?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Apparently they accessed the system parameters and customized a HAN and loadout according to there personal specifications,\" The tech replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean, 'specifications'?\" Terra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just watch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as the attacking Novarai neared it's victim, the yellow HAN fired a cable from the top of its wrist at a parked car a fair distance behind it. A pronged hook at the end of the line sunk into the car; anchoring to the end of the line. With a powerful upward yank the car shot skywards, a second downward tug brought the car down onto the charging Novarai's head sending it crashing to the ground before grinding to a halt. The first Novari charged at the yellow HAN who disconnected the line from its wrist and took up a boxing stance. The Novarai slammed into the Yellow mech before throwing a powerful punch at its head. The yellow machine reeled backwards before finding its footing in time to see its opponent coming back for a second attack. The yellow unit ducked under the gray mech's fist before grabbing its extended arm with both hands and slinging it into a nearby building. It then drew a pistol from a hidden holster in it's left thigh, but as it lined up the shot, the second Novarai smashed into its side sending it tumbling along the street. Yet, the yellow machine still managed to put itself right side up before sliding to a stop on its metal feet. The enemy wasted no time as it charged once again with it's sword at the ready. It slashed horizontally at the yellow armored frame before it only to cut air as the Yellow warrior bent its upper body backwards to avoid the blade before spring up and firing two quick right and left punches to the enemy's head. The Novarai staggered backwards as it was stunned by the sudden attack, allowing its yellow opponent to dash up and strike it in the chest with its right hand. The fingers on the right hand had pierced through the gray armor on impact, crippling the gray metallic beast. The wounded Novarai fell to its knees as its enemy snatched its hand back from its victims chest. By now the Novarai from earlier had gotten back to its feet and lined up a shot with the yellow fighters head. With little hesitation, the gray killing machine fired its weapon. The beam streaked toward its target, who spun to the side nearly falling over to avoid the deadly beam. It seemed that the full blooded Novarai had the advantage now. The yellow fighter took refuge in a nearby side street as the gray armored alien fired another shot, destroying a truck that was unfortunate enough to be in the line of fire after the initial target had dodged. The Novarai cautiously approached the entrance to the street where it's prey had disappeared moments ago and readied its weapon. Whipping around the corner, weapon drawn and finger on the trigger, the cybernetic soldier was surprised to find an empty street. Cautiously, the giant made its way through the street, searching for its quarry when seemingly out of nowhere a black cable with a grappled on the end of it wrapped around the muzzle of the Novarai's weapon before yanking it skyward. The Novarai looked up and focused its red eyes on a familiar yellow figure. The HAN stood suspended off of the side of a building, its left hand's claws dug into the concrete structure for support while its feet were placed squarely on the building's side and it's right arm now wielded the Novarai's stolen weapon before firing it and sending a laser right through its former owner ending the simulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Impressive, its a very innovative fighting style to say the least,\" Terra mused... \"Do you have the data for the pilots that applied to be assigned to Gato?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have it on this drive over here, would you like me to put it in a pad for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra nodded, \"Please? Oh and put their corresponding result's on there as well... along with our mystery pilot's data...\" Terra added as she absently glanced back at the screen which now displayed the yellow HAN's blue prints and specifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You think it could be a pilot that uses the facility regularly?\" The tech asked as he handed the electronic tablet over to Terra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terra sighed, \"They would be the most likely candidates, but then that raises the question, 'Why sneak in when you already have access?' And what's with that loadout for the HAN? I've never seen anyone use a setup like that, one clip and grapple lines with a handgun for a secondary? It's just so... unusual... are all of his simulations like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not exactly, but for the most part yeah,\" The tech replied. \"Same basic loadout minus a change hear and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What types of changes?\" Terra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oddly enough the pilot sometimes uses combat knives even though they already have the 'Kat Claws' equipped. Occasionally there will be an extra clip or two but the majority of the time they always lead with some type of mid ranged weapon to cover their approach before engaging in close range combat with hand guns, knives and claws...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see, well thanks for your help,\" Terra replied giving a wave as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing at twenty feet tall and covered in mechanical armor made of some unearthly metal that made titanium look like paper, our first assumption was that they were robots... but they weren't... These aliens were alive with organic parts interwoven into the mechanical parts. When one was killed by the American Military. It was taken apart and it was then that we understood that we were dealing with their version of man and machine. If the damaged a limb, they replaced it, if hey survived an explosion they regenerated, they had no known limits of strength and no real weaknesses.
