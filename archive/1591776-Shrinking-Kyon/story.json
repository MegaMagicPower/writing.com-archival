When I thought about it, I would have to endure this for the two more years, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I got to the shoe locker, I felt exhausted, which was odd, as I wasn\u2019t normally tired to this extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be the heat.\u201d I decided, walking grudgingly to homeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you know, when I got to class, Haruhi wasn\u2019t looking out the window, staring off into distance. She was too busy fanning herself with couple of notebooks. With her tongue sticking out, with sweat glistened on her forehead, I proceeded to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I sarcastically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hot really!\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed the joke completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt being a Monday, her hair wasn\u2019t done in pony tail, which probably didn\u2019t help with the overwhelming heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should really get a fan in our club room.\u201d I suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyon. That is an excellent idea!\u201d Haruhi exclaimed just as Okabe-sensei entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot day went by as usually, until I felt a sharp pain in my stomach, in period 3, two periods before lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSensei, may I be excused?\u201d I asked politely, as I headed toward bathroom. When I got there, it was empty, as classes were still on. I sat in a stall but it didn\u2019t help. Sitting there for 20 mins, I guessed that it was some kind of a false alarm, standing up and going out to the sink. Because it was so hot, I started to wash my face, before heading back to class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept... By the time I opened my eyes after washing my face, I found myself face to face with the sink top! Next thing I noticed was that my school uniform felt much heavier and baggier at the same time. And they were getting heavier. Before I knew it, I was completely trapped in the tent like clothes, which I fit into perfectly, only minutes ago. With a bit of digging, I managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why me!\u201d I almost cried. \u201cIs it you again, Haruhi! Did you want to meet a microscopic being?! Is that what this is about?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that I had to quickly head to SOS Brigade room, to obtain some help from the time traveler, esper or the super AI. It took me over 10 minutes to get to the door of the bathroom. Fortunately for me, there was plenty of gap for me to slide under. When I managed to get out, I truly realized how insignificantly small I was. The hall corridor went on for thousands of miles and the ceiling was higher than any planes could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky once again, SOS Brigade room was only three doors down the boy\u2019s toilet. However, at my size, it was a trip of at least 5 km.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even halfway there, the thing I dreaded occurred in the back of my mind. The lunch bell rang, releasing a horde of student stampede onto my path. Fearing for my life, I turned around and faced the wall, sticking to it as close as I could. After about 5 minutes, walking died down a bit, and I looked around, to see only few students still about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another 10 minutes, I managed to get to the door of my rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, I knocked before I go in, but at this size, I doubted anyone would hear my knocking. So, I squeezed under the door, to see that...</span></div></div>",

Where\u2019s it coming from?\u201d I asked myself, as I held my nose with my right hand. Looking around the gigantic surroundings, the only movement I saw was Haruhi sitting on her Commander chair, panting like a dog, with her shoes ditched to the side, with her feet hanging hundreds of feet above the ground<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom my perspective, it was a sight to beheld as she stood so tall that she seemed like such a powerful sentient being, with me being a piece of dirt to such a magnificent creature.. Anyway, back on topic, I wondered whether Haruhi did really cause this whole mess, and also whether the world would end, if I showed myself to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Haruhi, you always had to worry if she would scrap the current world and make a new one or not. However, I doubted that she would destroy the current one, just because she found her friend at size of a watermelon seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this mindset, I decided to approach the giantess, who could be my only hope of being restored to normal size. Or, possibly the cause of it all. I quickly dashed under the table, to avoid being stepped on, if anyone came into the room. Slowly but surely, I was getting nearer to Haruhi, and the closer I did, the louder the panting and stronger the smell of feet seemed to me, overloading my senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d Haruhi boomed to noone in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder the same question myself, as I expected everyone to be here by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes pass and now I am right under her right foot, as she has her right leg crossed over the left. From there, I can see how dirty the white socks have been stained and also how they are slightly wet with Haruhi\u2019s sweat. With it being so large and moving and blackish, it looked like a very large storm cloud. A wet one. As I further ventured on, I noticed that I can peek under Haruhi\u2019s sailor skirt, revealing her plain white cotton panty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reminded me of the times when she used to get changed in front of the boys. Those were some good times. Now, she became conscious, and kicks me out of the club room every time, using violence. Knowing that, I hoped that she doesn\u2019t look down right now, as it would be obvious that I am taking a scenic tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I make it to one of the leg of the chair that she\u2019s sitting on, only to realize that it\u2019s impossible for me to climb it as it has no footing and is merely a smooth metallic wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked, rubbing my head with my hands, annoyed by how strong her feet smelt and how tired I felt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, I felt it. Her feet shook the ground I stand on and made me fall on my ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ever not?\u201d I shouted up at her, knowing that she can\u2019t possibly hear my tiny voice. Well, I decided to head towards her feet, in the vein chance that I could climb all the way up to her ears. I decided to head for her left foot, which didn\u2019t seem to be tapping away, unlike the other one. As I get nearer, the tapping really scared me as the smelly mansion sized foot moves at such an extreme speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I get to the hill section of her left socked foot, I almost get knocked out by the sweaty stench. However, I can\u2019t afford such time as the lunch bell rings loudly, leaving me no choice but to quickly grab onto it, using the thread as foothold. Right on cue, Haruhi stands up and proceeds to put on her shoes, so that she can go back to class without stinking up the whole classroom, like she did with the club room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the foot is moving so fast, could I manage to climb above the \u201cevent horizon*\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*the highest level where the ankle ends up inside the shoe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I noticed that my left foot is stuck on the sweaty material that her left sock is made out of. As the foot reaches its destination and slides directly down, I inevitably end up inside the shoe, right under her Achilles\u2019 hill. The smell is unbearable, and the walls are wet with the beauty\u2019s foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her shoes back on, Haruhi heads back to class, wondering where everyone was. While she is casually walking back to class, I face the worst motion sickness and I literally puke on her somewhat-white socks. However, things get worse as, by the time she makes to her seat and sits down, by some magical means, the shoe that I\u2019m trapped in starts to heat up at an alarming rate, making me feel like I\u2019m being baked alive. All this in an eccentric and beautiful girl\u2019s left shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh. It\u2019s so hot! I need some ice!\u201d Haruhi mumbles, which I make out. \u201cWhere is Kyon anyway?!\u201d She wonders as she pulls out the necessary books for her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in hell!\u201d I repeat in my head, as I lose consciousness.</span></div></div>",

Lastly, I could hear Haruhi announce, \u201cKyon has disappeared, from class and it\u2019s up to SOS Brigade to find him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly, Suzumiya-san, could you possibly put your shoes back on?\u201d I heard Koizumi ask nicely. \u201cIt\u2019s giving off quite a stink, and we are already having hard time dealing with the heat.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Haruhi replied, \u201cTaking shoes off helps so much! You guys should follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this about Kyon-kun\u2019s disappearance?\u201d Asahina-san asked, with a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, sweet Asahina-san.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My eyes peeled open slightly, determined to see what was happening as my world shook. I was blessed by a blurry vision of a couple pairs of legs that rested under the table before the inconsiderate goddess crammed me back into her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows where they're going?\" Haruhi boomed above, the last words I hear before the side of the shoe knocked me off the sock and onto the insole. I blacked out from a tremendous pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..gato... ho.me...\" My eyes slowly opened to garbled speech. I gazed down, my lower body crushed under Haruhi's dingy sock. How am I even alive? Perhaps there's some part of Haruhi that actually cares for me enough to make me more durable? She is a god after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cringed as I felt Haru's sweat squeeze out onto me as she applied more pressure. I took a shocked breath as her foot lifted up slightly, forcing my entire body to slip under her crushing mass.<br>\r\n\"N..no!\" I yelled, a bad decision on my part as her sock made contact with my tongue. It was soaked, my mind reeled as my head was jammed between her toes. Heat radiated off the playful digits as they squeezed together, ready for the next step. Pressure on my chest built up as my unaware tormentor readied for another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish to blackout, yet it never happened. Why was it so easy to do before? There must be a reason, there must be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts could no longer go on as the pressure released. My body tumbled awkwardly down to her heel, just in time for it to crash down. I couldn't help but yell out as the worst pressure I've ever encountered jammed me into Haruhi's used insole. I didn't black out, and nothing broke but my mind. I quickly recovered as the heel lifted off, letting me slide down to her arch which I grabbed onto for dear life. The foot lifted before slamming down, pressing the horrifying sock gently down onto me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving only the heat to deal with I could only think how Haruhi was simply heading home after a long day at school. I saw her wander home a thousand times, yet I never imagined it to effect me in such a way. In fact, I was glad when she went home, it gave me a small break back to the 'norm'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever had I imagined that I would be in her shoe, used as a second insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy grip faltered as her foot lifted, my body slipped under her toes for a few steps, before being grinded under her ball and heel. I prayed to black out, or be released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes seemed like an eternity as the unaware goddess entered her house. I don't know what I expected as her sock draped foot slid off of me, rolling me down the length of her foot before casually kicking her shoes out of the way. My eyes were slow to ajust to the blinding light that entered the shoe. The heat didn't make much effort to leave as I lay still, indented on Haruhi's battered insole. I slowly regained my composure, slowly realizing she could return at any point in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally ajusting to the light, I could finally see the peeling interior of the shoe. These shoes had seen better years, holes had started to form where the goddess curls her toes and grinds her ball. I slowly crawled towards the heel, shuddering in memory of Haruhi's weight crashing into my defenseless body. All hope drained from my face as I gazed at her ceiling. As frayed as the walls of her shoe was, there was no way I could climb the towering walls. There were too many smooth area's and  each side curved slightly in, making it even harder to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind reeled at the thought of supporting the hyperactive girl as an insole for the rest of my life. There must be some way out, there must be...</span></div></div>",

Even though I had \"mysteriously disappeared\" as Haruhi so quaintly put it, I was apparently still nothing more to the girl then a chance to deal with the supernatural! Talk about selfish! Then again this was the kind of behavior I had become accustomed to from Haruhi Suzumiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe his clothes have a clue!\" Haruhi suddenly yelled out, getting to her feet. Not that I could see this or anything but from the sound of her voice she seemed to be getting ready to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go get them! Wait here everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Haruhi was gone, racing off to the boy's bathroom. I sure hope no one's in there when she bursts in. In her haste Haruhi had kicked over her shoe. Thanks to my every increasing luck, it was the shoe I was in. Naturally I was sent flying from the smelly footwear and skidded across the tiles of the Brigade room floor, my skin chaffing. When I stopped rolling I rubbed my eyes hoping to get the sweat gone so I could at least see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my eyes were finally clear I looked up and saw I was at Nagato-san's feet. Her face was obscured by the thick hard cover book she was reading. Deciding she was my best bet at this moment I tried getting her attention. I shouted, I danced, I waved my arms, and did a number of embarrassing things I'd rather not think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sat there turning another page. I sighed and tried to think of another plan. Before I could, a god smiled on me. Thankfully it wasn't Haruhi. If you even believe in that stuff. Nagato was staring down at me. She closed her book and set it on the table. Koizumi and Asahina-san instantly looked over at her. Whenever Nagato put her book down it usually meant it was time to leave. I could hear the ever present smile in Koizumi's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Suzumiya-san would want us to leave so early Nagato-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato kept her silence and merely picked me up. Before I knew what was happening the alien bookworm had me enclosed in her slender fingers. Her hands were as cold as her demeanor. With little ceremony she dropped me on the table. Hey, be careful! I'm a living thing you know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi and Asahina-san were both staring down at me in shock. I quickly covered myself, my cheeks flushing red. I suppose I didn't really mind Asahina-san staring at me with her beautiful eyes but Koizumi was staring too! I wanted to punch that guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened to Kyon-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina-san's voice was like a soothing melody to me. She wouldn't allow me to be crushed into her sweaty shoe like used gum. Not like that demon in a school girl's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears our Kyon-kun has shrank somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for that Mr. Genius! What will your next brilliant deduction be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, he's still as quick to anger as ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi's smile was starting to get on my nerves again. I turned to Asahina-san.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anything like this ever happened in your time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, never. I'm sorry but, even if it had happened before the information would be classified. Forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could I ever refuse a request from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nagato-san, do you anything about Kyon-kun's predicament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlunt as ever. That's our Nagato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However with sufficient time I may be able to find a solution to his predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ray of hope at last! Maybe I wouldn't be stuck like this for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to find a sufficient solution I will need to converse with the Data Sentient Entity. That may take hours or years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart was suddenly filled with darkness. Years? Was she serious? What am I saying, Nagato-san's always serious. I looked up and saw a look of dismay on everyone's (barring Nagato of course) faces. Koizumi was the first to recover. His smile was soon back in place, the bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can also talk with the 'Organization' and see if they know of anything like this happening. In the meantime, I think it's best if we keep this a secret from Suzumiya-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's decided we have to discuss who will be taking care of Kyon-kun while Nagato-san and myself try and figure out what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was I, a class pet? I wasn't about to passed around like a gerbil! Then again, if Asahina-san was the one taking care of me...oh, all the powers that be, please let her volunteer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be best if we take turns. That way Suzumiya-san won't find him as easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn that Koizumi and his ideas! Whatever, I suppose I could stand being taken care of by Nagato and that guy if it meant time with Asahina-san.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, who should get him first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi walked over to the bookshelf and grabbed the Go stone container. Shaking it up he put it in the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, whoever draws a black Go stone gets him first. We'll keep drawing stones until only one of us has a black stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched them decide my fate by drawing board game pieces. After five draws, no one had singly drawn a black stone. Every time I saw Koizumi holding a black stone my heart jumped. They'd better hurry up before Haruhi got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was over. It looked like I would be going with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: This chapter was originally made by the following author:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/view_item/user_id/marik\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/view_item/us...</a></span></div></div>",

I thought I saw a hint of disappointment, or maybe it was just my imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he is, for tonight anyhow.\u201d Koizumi pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Suzumiya-san was becoming uninterested with the world again, and wanted one of us to mysteriously vanish... Because of that, the reality was distorted to allow Kyon-kun to do so, by simplying shrinking away from her sight.\u201d Koizumi suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite probable.\u201d Nagato added silently, studying me with her emotionless eyes. She can probably be programmed to see without those eyes on her, just like how her glasses were an accessory. Even if she was able to take off those eyes, she would be able to express just as much emotion as she does now, as her eyes do not serve in showing emotion, for Nagato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-umm, Kyon-kun, is it cold for you?\u201d Asahina-san asked, holding a tiny strip of tissue paper between her fingers. Oh, how compassionate you are, Asahina-san. You deserve no less than Novel Peace Prize! However, in the end, I refused, as I knew that I couldn\u2019t possibly be cold for weeks to come, after having faced an ordeal of heat and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd is that you, giving off that stink?\u201d Koizumi added, with that foolish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you catching some of those bluntness from Nagato? You just interrupted the gracious Asahina-san\u2019s conversation with me! Excuse yourself and go get executed by Haruhi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I realized, that I probably was giving off a bad stench, as I just spent half a day in Haruhi\u2019s sweaty shoes. Sniffing myself, it brought me back the memories of the hell I endured, only tens of minutes ago. Why is it you always bring out the bad in me, you bastard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you at least like to wipe off the dry sweat, Kyon-kun?\u201d Asahina-san asked once again, offering the same handkerchief, except now wet with tap water. I accepted the enormous blanket-sized tissue strip and wrapped myself around them. Being so wet and large, they felt like I was carrying those camera equipments all over again, up and down the school hill. However, it did feel good, as I managed to remove all dirt and sock lint that was stuck to me, thanks to Haruhi\u2019s sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recounting my brave tale, they decided to hide me, as Haruhi would come back soon. Once again, I found myself on top of Nagato\u2019s open palm, surrounded by her short but thin fingers. By the way, can someone guess what it feels like to be standing in the middle of a basketball field that is pulsating and soft but firm at the same time? Because that\u2019s exactly how it feels, to be carried by Nagato. Oh, and there was a distinct scent of old books, which I found intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carried me so easily like I weighed nothing, I had a rush of feeling of powerlessness. However I calmed myself down knowing that Nagato wasn\u2019t power hungry unlike the evil dictator of the technically non-existent SOS Brigade. But then again, Nagato could have carried me easily, before I shrank to an inch tall anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they deposited me in Nagato\u2019s bag pocket, and I could hear Nagato chanting from the outside. It always brought me a chill whenever I heard her do that. Before long, the zippers of the pocket disappeared out of existence, and in turn, the small streams of light that came through disappeared, leaving me in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lied down to get comfortable, only to realize that I was falling asleep. But then, does anyone have the guts to blame me? I mean, I survived being under a skyscraper, with an ego to match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought came to my mind as my eyelids fell. Nagato wouldn\u2019t have rigged the selection of the pieces in her favor, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Remember when I said a god was smiling down at me? Too late I realize that it must have been Haruhi after all. Either that or my luck was as rotten as an apple in winter. Koizumi was holding up a black stone while the sweet Asahina-san and expressionless Nagato each held a white stone. Asahina-san's face fell as she saw that she had lost. Nagato merely put her stone with the small pile she had already accumulated. Asahina-san smiled sadly at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we decide who gets Kyon-kun second and third?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever has the most black stones in their pile will get him second and the last person will get him third.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi, smile firmly in place, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down with my head in my hands as Asahina-san and Nagato counted up their Go stones. How could this have happened? Why did Koizumi get to have me first? I never liked being around him too much when I was taller than him. Now that he's several times my size and naked to boot the last thing I wast is to be alone with him in his house! Come to think of it, had I ever seen his house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have twelve black stones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like I would be spending time in Heaven after I paid my debts in Hell. Before anything else could happen, Nagato grabbed her book and went back to reading as Haruhi slammed the door open my clothes bundled under one arm. I got a glimpse of her furious face before Koizumi, that presumptuous man, grabbed me and stuffed me in his jacket pocket. I sank into utter darkness as I fell into the bottom of the pocket. At least he kept his uniform clean. There wasn't a speck of dirt anywhere to be felt. My eyes were useless in this darkness but I could still hear Haruhi raving like a lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those damn teachers! Why are they always getting in my way? What kind of stupid rule is it that a girl can't even go into the boy's bathroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously privacy and conventions meant nothing to Haruhi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still managed to snag Kyon's clothes! Let's take a look at them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard my uniform being sprawled out on the table along with the clatter of Go stones. Asahina-san must be scooping them back into their container. Nagato would still be reading and Koizumi would no doubt be helping Haruhi search my clothes. Wait a minute, I don't want either of those two touching my underwear! This isn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the situation was totally and completely out of my hands there wasn't much I could do except lay out in the bottom of the pocket and wait. In this hot weather the pocket heated up quickly and I was sweating in no time. Unfortunately I had nothing to fan myself with and there was absolutely nothing in Koizumi's pockets, not even a ten yen coin! Even that would have been better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been searching through my clothes for the better part of half an hour before I heard Nagato's book close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I guess there's nothing here. Still, I'm taking these clothes with me! There's a chance Kyon might get beamed back down with stories about aliens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne...track...mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of clean up filled the air, with Nagato silently exiting the room, Asahina-san changing back into her school uniform as Haruhi raved about my sudden \"experience\" and Koizumi quietly made his escape. I felt myself swaying slightly with Koizumi's movements, his heartbeat a constant sound behind me. He was walking at a leisurely pace, as if he had tiny living humans in his pocket all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to take you out until I get to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice drifted quietly down to me. I sure hope no one was around to hear him talking to himself. Then again, who really cares what people think about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't take too long to get to my home. Once we're there I'll find something for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, I wonder what he'd manage to scrounge up. It's like people kept clothes for inch tall humans. Not even dolls had clothes that small. I lost track of time as I sat in the darkness of Koizumi's breast pocket, my body continuing to heat up. Finally, as I was about to pass out from the heat, I saw Koizumi's hand descending down towards me like a god's from above. His grip was gentle and I was slowly deposited onto his desk. So this was Koizumi's room. It was surprisingly normal. That made sense I suppose since Koizumi is just an average student until he enters a Sealed Reality. I looked up and saw him staring down at me with his cat's grin. I quickly covered myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you just get me those clothes you promised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi giggled like a creep and headed toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move from that spot until I get back Kyon-kun. I wouldn't want you getting lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever, I don't need someone like you treating me like a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi left the door open as he went to fetch my new clothes. I sighed and sat down. Not even as a kid had I ever felt this fragile. It was weird. I didn't like feeling so helpless. Even when I was with Haruhi at normal size I never felt this vulnerable even though she could destroy reality if she wanted too. How many situations have I gotten into since I met Haruhi? I don't have the time or the skill to count them all. If somebody out there has time, could you please count them up for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE:<br>\r\nThis chapter was originally done by the following author:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/view_item/user_id/marik\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/view_item/us...</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wake to see that I\u2019m still in darkness. Despite that, I notice that the smell has changed slightly. Before I blacked out, all I could smell was sweat but now, there\u2019s a hint of another musty scent that I can\u2019t pin down. Feeling the surface, I can tell that I am still near her sweaty sock. Listening carefully, I manage to hear the shower water running. Putting one and one together, I quickly come to the conclusion that I have ended up in Haruhi\u2019s laundry basket, trapped in her sock, and surrounded by her used underwear that give off strong feminine scent. Even so, the odour coming off the sock is too strong, and I also realized that I smell like her feet as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. I sure hope she doesn\u2019t have a dryer at home, otherwise she would be able to wash her clothes at this supposedly late hour. And that wouldn\u2019t be too good at my size. Without being able to see, I tried to stretch the sock and create enough gap for me to get out. However, it seemed impossible as I\u2019m no where near strong enough, and all I am rewarded is Haruhi\u2019s fresh sweat on my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, think of something Kyon. That\u2019s it! I will bite my way through this sock! I should be able to still tear the sock at a microscopic level and nibble my way out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch simple tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not. As I took a bite, I couldn\u2019t help but to pull the horrible stuff away from my mouth and yell out profanities. It tasted like vinegar mixed with sand! It probably was! Maybe it\u2019s easier drowning in the washing machine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t stop now! If I die, who\u2019s going to keep Haruhi in check, making sure she doesn\u2019t destroy the whole world? What a tough role I have. Next thought that pops up in my mind is whether it\u2019s possible to bite off my tongue, without dying. That would be so convenient right about now. While I\u2019m having these philosophical thoughts, I hear the water go off, meaning that Haruhi has finished her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith increased urgency, I close my eyes and clench my teeth over the same place that I took the first taste in. As I bite hard into it and pull, I can practically feel the Haruhi\u2019s sweat being squeezed out and fall onto my accursed tongue. Ignoring the searing pain, I keep at it, and with almost no noise, the sock rips enough for my fist to get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with that small gap, I easily enlarged it enough for me to slip through. As I jump out the sweaty hole, light streams into my eyes, blinding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I open my eyes, my eye level\u2019s on the same level as a blue cotton wall of some kind. As I look up, squinting, it all sinks in as Haruhi\u2019s standing over the laundry basket, with some red towels in her hand. She could have fooled me as a colossal ancient water monster, who just came out of the sea! Her face was so radiant and her shiny black hair was hanging down at all places. Each hair bombarded cold water drops at me. While I\u2019m stunned from the view, Haruhi ...</span></div></div>",

I realized what she was doing and quickly jumped to the side, to avoid being trapped under the wet towel that probably weighed tens of tons. Alas, my miniscule legs didn\u2019t do the job and I ended up right below it, being entrapped under the towel, on my chest. As I felt Haruhi walk away, my nose picked up the aroma from nearby clothes. From above, I could smell a weak scent of shampoo and washing powder. From below, I smelt a musty scent, and I had to look down before I could confirm what it was. Apparently, I was trapped on top of Haruhi\u2019s white cotton panty that she was wearing at school. It reeked an overwhelming aroma of feminine perspiration, probably because today was so hot! My head was getting dizzy from such a strong whiff and was aroused immediately. Lying there, the towel from above was restricting my movement greatly and I knew that I couldn\u2019t stay here all night, as I would face doom in the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing hungry, tired and smelly didn\u2019t help me lift the heavy towel that was giving off a heavenly scent.

There\u2019s still a bit of warmth left on the panty and I snuggle up to it, to keep myself warm, as the towel is wet with cold water, chilling me. Being overwhelmed with such a pleasant odour helped me fall into sleep that I much needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In my dream, I woke to find myself taped onto an enormous chair, unable to free myself. All I could see was the ceiling and a table just as large. Then, I remembered that I shrunk to a pea size, only few hours ago. However, I didn\u2019t realizing that this was a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Within seconds, my vision was filled with Haruhi\u2019s smiling face that could have left any boy with his mouth open. Since I\u2019m an any boy, that\u2019s exactly what I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cW...What\u2019s going on, Haruhi?!\u201d I shouted up at the giantess who could clearly see me taped onto the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHuh? What did you say Kyon? I can barely hear you!\u201d Haruhi giggled. \u201cThis is so exciting! Isn\u2019t it?\u201d Haruhi shouts, making your ears numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cThanks again for letting me experiment on you, Kyon,\u201d Haruhi exclaimed, \u201cI owe you one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWhat? I never agreed to no experiment!\u201d I shouted as loud as I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cCan\u2019t you speak up, Kyon?\u201d Haruhi replied with an annoyed tone. Next thing I realize is that, Haruhi is in her very revealing black bunny costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cTest 1. Take 1. Let\u2019s see how much pressure you can handle.\u201d Haruhi said, matter-of-factly. I cannot comprehend what\u2019s going on, until all I can see hovering above me is, Haruhi\u2019s ass, with a bunny tail right in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNo! Stop! You will crush me!\u201d I yelled, as Haruhi slowly starts to descend her ass right on top of me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she sat on me, with her fluffy tail in my face, many things changed in my world. First my vision was impaired and I couldn\u2019t see anything anymore. Next, I was enveloped in feint but tangy odour of perspiration. Lastly, there was an immense pressure, increasing every instance. By the time she sat down completely, I was stuck under her asscrack without being able to breathe or see where I was. However, from the smell of it, I guessed where I was. There was a reek of stink that made me want to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    How cruel can you get, Haruhi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    My question was answered as Haruhi simply exclaimed, sounding like a child playing a game, \u201cYou okay down there, Kyon? I will increase the pressure some more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Of course, my mouth was muffled by the ass flesh of this teenage goddess, but I knew that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered one way or another. Ass flesh or no ass flesh. She couldn\u2019t hear me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I wondered what she was going to do now, until the world as I knew it started to wiggle slowly, scraping along my fragile skin with the rough fishnet skin. It was scratching my skin off! And it only got worse. Haruhi started to grind her ass into the little me, who was in ecstasy of pleasure and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Here I was, under one of the hottest-girl-I-know\u2019s ass. She was rubbing her herself up and down me. This was such a turn on, but along with it, I literally felt my arm skin, rip off like paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Within seconds, the pleasure I was feeling disappeared and all I was left with was pain like I never knew. I was bleeding from all over the place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Then, I literally felt my self die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Wow, what a horny dream... I woke up, lying face down into Haruhi\u2019s worn underwear. Maybe that\u2019s why I had the dream, by being overwhelmed with her sex aroma...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    While I was trying to stretch, I felt the basket lift up, and start moving somewhere. Oh no. Laundry\u2019s are done in the morning right? I quickly responded by trying to pull myself out of this mess. About a minute later, I felt the basket drop free fall and land with a loud crash. Of course, I heard a washing machine\u2019s lid open, and I also heard someone yawn in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    With a quick lift of the basket, I felt myself freefall and I knew where I was. I landed in the washing machine. Looking up, I saw Haruhi\u2019s sleeping face. She looked so cute, even with such a face. She proceeded to spray some washing powder and it rained down like snow, covering me in the white powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Even with such bad footing on the wet clothes, with an adrenalin rush I quickly climbed to the top, where there was a large pile of the washing powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When Haruhi finished pouring the washing powder, she put her hand on the handle and looked down one last to check before closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Using that chance, I grabbed a handful of the white snowy stuff and threw it in the air, creating a mini gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Did Haruhi see me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon, I was taken to Haruhi\u2019s kitchen where I was able to drink fresh water and pieces of bread with some strawberry jam. It was a great relief and change from all the sweat and dirt that I had to eat and chew on for the last few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. What\u2019s it like being so small?\u201d Haruhi finally whispered, realizing how much harm she was doing to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, I decided not to tell her how powerful she looks as her ego didn\u2019t any more big-sizing. Secondly, I told her everything since the beginning and how it is that I ended up in her washing machine. I also didn\u2019t forget to mention how much her feet stunk and also how hot and sweaty it was in her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your sense of taste, hearing, sight and smell seems to be perfectly fine. How about your sense of touch?\u201d Haruhi continued as she kept writing down things that she deemed as interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the clock in Haruhi\u2019s kitchen read 8 am, meaning that Haruhi had to go to school. We agreed that I should go to school get help from the SOS Brigade. And because I was too small, I would have been easily crushed in her bag, so we decided that it would be most safe for me to go to school in a locket. After some rummaging around, she managed to find a locket and placed me inside it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, there was a gap for air to come in and out, allowing me to breathe. For she wore it when she was little, the locket only hung around at Haruhi\u2019s collarbone. The swinging wasn\u2019t too bad and I got used to it soon after. Looking out, I could see the monstrous environment that I now found myself in, as all things dwarfed me to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to go?\u201d Haruhi whispered, down to the locker that I was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that she couldn\u2019t see through the dark glass, I couldn\u2019t help but give her a nod.</span></div></div>",

Uncaring brown eyes stared like wood, hard and cold. She sat down gently and without a sound. Silver hair dangled without movement, desperate to reach her shoulders without success. She licked her thumb and flicked to the next page without a hint of emotion. My, my, my... I'm describing things to much, lets just continue the story. \"YU--KIIIIIIIII\" My voice sounded small, even too me. I knew that there was no hope of being seen from here.

HoO-oo--T!\" Haruhi whined, ger eyes roled over towards the calm and collective Yuki. She stoos up and pointed a accusing fingure at Yuki, \"How can you act so cool in the middle of a heat wave!\" She pouted, tapping her foot inpatiently. Yuki paused, ripping her eyes from her book,<br>\r\n\"... I stay still.\" She replied, her eyes moving back to her book. Haruhi shook her head,<br>\r\n\"Pfft, that's stupid. You don't get much done laying still. For example\" She flicked a bug from Yuki's knee, \"See? I accomplished something... how? By moving!\" She huffed and slumped back in her chair, muttering darkly.<br>\r\n\"...

Within 60 seconds, her titanic, sweaty rear end lifted, leaving me in a pool of her leftover sweat. My celebrations were cut short though as her ass hovered briefly, moving back a bit before slamming back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi bore her usual pompous bored face as she shut her eyes and scooted her chair forward, unknowingly crushing her friend Kyon each time before reaching a proper upright position. She rested her elbows on her desk with an ominous sigh as she felt an embarrassing tickling sensation on her crotch. She glanced down with annoyance, grinding the feeling away in an unladylike manner before panting \"HooooOooo~t!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, I think she's pounded me enough... god... what is that fragrance?

As long as I stay away from 'it' I should be fine. Not that I don't find her attractive but being in a hyped up, giant gods panties sounds like a very bad idea. Oh damn! She's moving!

I rubbed my head, whilst falling in response to the impact, and after realizing what was actually happening, closed my eyes and braced for impact. 'Please don't die, please don't die, please don't die...' I repeated the words in my head, not wanting to hit the for below, but to my surprise, and pleasure, at some point, she decided to take her feet out of her shoes, guaranteeing a conveniently located are for me to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If she had at least looked in my general direction, I probably would have thought that she did this on purpose. As some kind of precognition to save me.' I simply lied there, on the slightly wet ground, with a slight smell wafting through the air. I'm only just sane enough to not show some form of physical affection to this shoe that possibly saved my life. When I regained myself, and any kind of adrenaline now gone, I tried to assess my situation. And just when I was about to sit up, something splashed on my face. I'm surprised I hadn't noticed it before, but for some reason, her feet were hanging above my location. As usual, they're covered by the short black socks, that covered only a bit passed her ankle. Apparently, despite the lack of reaction, her body at least, was definitely being affected by the heat. If the sweat that was soaked in her insole, and dripping from her foot had anything to say about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but wonder why they aren't on the ground though, she isn't short enough for her legs to dangle, unless of course she is sat as far back as she can, and trying to keep them off of the floor for some reason. Though, however unlikely, the possibility of her assisting me was still out there. Though if that was the case, why didn't she just reach down and grab me? To keep attention away from Haruhi? If so, that was probably the best call, since she could only make things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, staying here, allowing sweat to fall on my face, isn't helping. I think it's time to get moving, and the only thing I can think of is to jump up to ger feet, and begin climbing. Whether or not she was already aware of me, it should be easy enough to get her to notice. After all, she is Nagato Yuki, the most reliable person in the SOS Brigade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how did this actually happen..?</span></div></div>",

She slides from one end of the room to the other at an immeasurable speed, making me forget that I stood a head taller than her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered that I have come here to get in touch with her, and decided to proceed to it. While she\u2019s making ice tea, she\u2019s moving too much and I dared not go near her, afraid that she could crush me without even knowing about it. Therefore, I waited until she took a seat at her usual sit, with a ice cold cup of tea within her soft palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is now sitting still, I approach her slowly and easily climb the low-hill shoes and walk over her foot, taking in a slight whiff of her feet, which turn out to be quite pleasant.

Unfortunately, I thought wrong, as, by the time I came out, with great anticipations, my eardrums were about to burst as the two girls are running around in circle around the table, both shouting and squealing at each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...

Next thing I knew, I was being lifted along with the skirt, and I heard Asahina-san plea, \u201cCan we not do this today, Suzumiya-san? Please?\u201d I could just imagine her begging with those big eyes that draw anyone in. Anyone except Haruhi. Or is it because Haruhi isn\u2019t anyone ordinary? Arggh, I don\u2019t know, but I didn\u2019t get to hear the reply as I ended up in a dark locker with little or no ventilation. But then again, I knew what Haruhi\u2019s answer would have been. Seconds later, the familiar scent came back, arousing me greatly. Yet, it was frustrating, knowing that I\u2019m stuck with only Asahina-san\u2019s skirt. Deeper in, there were more rewarding prizes. However, I couldn\u2019t reach them because the skirt was too heavy for me to push through. Ah, it was a blessing and a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about what kind of crazy advertisement Haruhi could be possibly doing now, with frightened Asahina-san as her toy. Something probably indecent and illegal. I hoped that Asahina-san didn\u2019t get in trouble because of Haruhi, like last time, when she had to go see the principal. Really though, I knew that it didn\u2019t really matter, considering Asahina-san was from a different Temporal Plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to my situation, I was getting really drunk in the scent and I felt frustrated that I couldn\u2019t do anything about the aroma that was seducing my nose.

The two beauties were giving quite a show, and I just stood there with my erection, noticing how perfect proportioned and faultless their bodies were, beside for the star shaped mole on Asahina-san\u2019s left breast.

This was so wrong, this murderess that has tried to kill me twice and now she was looking at me with her eyes that to my scale were as big as what the clubroom was, she could see every part of my naked body like a scientist examining a microbe under a microscope. Now I know what a bug feels like. To say that I was scared would be understating things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, if it isn't Kyon. I knew that my control over your size spatial data would work like a charm, now you are small enough for me to kill your fragile human body without even needing to make a closed space area\" her voice rattled me across my whole body as I now</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I heard the rumble underneath the floorboards as her whole body rose like a monster and I knew that I was going to die. As I took one last look into those unfeeling eyes I knew that I had to run, get away from her before I was squished to a pulp. I wasn't meant to die by being squished underneath the shoe of a kaij\u016b schoolgirl! And that's what I did, I started sprinting over to the gigantic table in the clubroom and then the ground shook underneath me and then again and again as this walking skyscraper moved unstoppably closer to me. I glanced upward and I was now right between both of her shoes and staring directly up her skirt to see something I shouldn't be seeing if I wasn't this small, her gigantic panties. So huge, and even at a time like this I could feel arousal from the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke again \"Silly me I should have done this as soon as I saw you!\" As I started running again the world started to expand around me. No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm shrinking even more! How small do I have to be? Foul play, I call foul play! By the time I stopped shrinking I saw her shoe had exploded to being bigger then even a football field as it now hung over my head, like a mountain about to collapse right on top of me, this was it, I was going to die and there was definitely no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am I ashamed to admit that at this last moment I curled into foetal position and felt the air rush out from the shoe about to smash me to oblivion, but then, nothing. Wait, aren't I supposed to die now? I came out from my position and looked upwards. There was another familiar sight, A tiny Yuki Nagato just underneath Ryouko's shoe! Her own little body, seemed to be blocking that great mountain from collapsing on top of me. I saw Ryouko look down, still smiling from up above like a Great Goddess. \"AH NAGATO SAN, YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT WHILE YOU ARE CONTAINED IN THIS SPATIAL FIELD I WILL BE FAR BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYTHING YOUR TINY FORM CAN THROW AT ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I found myself on top of a giant brown surface, only to realise moments later I was on the table of the SOS Brigade. Ryouko's voice boomed again \"HOW WILL YOU PROTECT KYON WHILE YOU FIGHT ME? DON'T THINK YOU CAN PULL THAT TRICK YOU PULLED ON ME THE LAST TIME WE DID THIS!\" A beam of light now emerged from one of her hands and I was moved again, to the top of the bookshelf as I saw the whole table being vapourised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain I found myself in front of a massive glass screen, I realised that it was the computer stolen from the computer club after that blackmail. I wonder what Haruhi would make of this battle? No, Kyon focus! I then quickly turned to face Yuki in front of me as Ryouko's footsteps stomped towards us. I saw that Nagato had blood all over her body. \"Nagato san, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyouko's voice now scared me more then ever if she had managed to defeat even this alien girl \"I TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULDN'T WIN! NOW STOP PUTTING OFF THE INEVITABLE AND JUST DIE!\" Her hand reached down to squish me but then it stopped. That beautiful smile never left her face \"YOU THINK THIS FORCE FIELD WILL HOLD OUT FOREVER?\" She prodded and poked at an area only metres from the both of us but couldn't make any headway. \"Nagato, please, you have to stop her!\" I pleaded. She spoke softly \"I am injured and it will take some time to repair the damage. I have another backup, though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" I said. Suddenly I saw the wall crack open on the right side of the room and a giantess Emiri Kimidori appeared! She was another one of these Data Sentient - Oh I don't know. All I know is that we were saved as Ryouko's expression turned to that of sheer horror. \"BUT HOW COULD THIS BE?\" She asked. Emiri stood confidently as she spoke \"You will not harm this human. Retreat now, or I will shut you down myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyouko now hung her head \"THIS IS NOT THE LAST TIME WE WILL MEET. YOU WILL LIVE FOR NOW KYON. GOODBYE!\" And just like that she disappeared. Oh god, what a day it has been! Emiri then walked over to the desk we were perched on and sat down in the Brigade Chief's Chair as she looked at us, each movement creating an earth shattering quake. They seemed to be communicating telepathically, or at least that is what I thought it was, at least I was glad my eardrums weren't going to explode from this Goddess talking to us. \"Emiri tells us that Ryouko's spatial lock on your size will take some time to undo\" I noticed that I was starting to grow again as well as Yuki, I was ecstatic, but then it stopped when I reached the size I was before entering the room today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The decompression won't go any further then this, so Emiri will have to take us some place else\" I looked up at her, now I was embarrassed as I realised she could now see my whole naked body. Oh god, please don't look at me like this. \"It's okay Yuki, I don't really have a size fetish anyway\" Yuki looked at me with an obscure expression \"What is a size fetish?\" Oh my god did I really just say that? \"Oh uh, it's nothing, never mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something else happened just then</span></div></div>",

He now needs help from his trusty supernatural friends from the SOS Brigade. Who would\u2019ve thought, that Kyon would be a SOS Brigade customer? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the original production, the story will be told in first person view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of Out-of-Character are expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi Suzumiya:<br>\r\nCommander of SOS, out to find all abnormal and supernatural beings. Some of the SOS members refer to her as \u201cGod\u201d, due to her self-unknown ability to create and destroy realities. However, if she ever found Kyon at current state, she would probably want to do experiments on him! Kyon better be careful around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsahina Mikuru:<br>\r\nThe mascot of SOS, always being forced to cosplay by Haruhi into various embarrassing costumes! A cutie with the knowledge of time travelling. She might know how to fix Kyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato Yuki:<br>\r\nTechnically not a SOS member, but joined because there wasn\u2019t a Literature club anymore. She is a Living Humanoid Interface, with power of data manipulation, not to mention super human strength and speed. Emotionless at most of the times, but very knowledgeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi Itsuki:<br>\r\nA so called esper, except he\u2019s no different from any normal young male most of the times. However, once he enters Sealed Realities, he is able to fly around, along with gaining powerful attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevamped, as I promise to add once every few days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
