I rolled over in my bed, still groggy from staying up late last night. As I rolled over, I saw that my alarm clock said <b>8:05 a.m.</b> and and panicked as I realized that school starts at 8:15. The only thing i could think about, as I jumped out of your bed, was how pissed at me Mom would be that I was late to school. For the most part, I lived by myself at home. My mom usually slept overnight at work and my dad died 5 years ago. My older sister was usually off doing who knows what with her boyfriend so that just left me home alone a lot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As I struggled to get out the house, an unsettling feeling in the air. At the time, I shrug it off being that I still stuck on the looming presence of the of being late for school. Mom would take away my phone for at least a week. The closer i got to school, the more uneasy I felt. Then it hit me. Literally, it hit me. A truck had just smacked right in to me going at least ten over the speed limit. Somehow, I managed to stand back up but i was unscathed from the impact. I checked on the person driving the truck and, to my surprise, no one was present. I looked back at my watch and my heart jumped as I realized school started 2 minutes ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Shift to present tense</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I looked away from my watch and back at the truck that just hit me, after running me over it parked itself, and wouldn\u2019t look the slightest bit out of place to anyone besides me, the guy that just got run over by the fucker... I look at it a moment longer but no one jumps out of it, no clowns, no midgets, nada, just as empty as when it first flattened me. Speaking of flattening, I look down at myself again... no obvious injuries... no pain, the only evidence of the event is a dusty imprint of the vehicle\u2019s grill on my shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I\u2019m already late, and I do have some evidence that someone hit me... I suppose I could just pull an excuse out of my ass when I get into class, say some guy knocked me over and wouldn\u2019t let me go until he was sure I was okay. Story straight in my head, I nod and make my way to class. It takes me several more minutes to get my stuff out of my locker and by the time I open the door to math it\u2019s already ten minutes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately my teacher, Mr. Grayson, an older man that looks like he should be teaching at an old, stuffy university, notices me and fixes me with the evil eye. \u201cAh Mr. Johnson, so good of you to join us! Mind telling us why you are ten minutes late today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Well, guess that means I\u2019m still alive and haven\u2019t been wandering around as a ghost!</i>\u201d I think to myself before pointing at my shirt. \u201cSome guy in a Toyota nearly turned me into a hood ornament, wouldn\u2019t let me go until he was sure I was alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrayson squints at the mark and then his eyes bulge. \u201cYou were ran over?! Are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like knocked on my butt... I\u2019m fine, I feel fine!\u201d I protest as he walks over, and lifts my shirt up in front of the class! I do work out so it\u2019s not too embarrassing, but still! Of course, maybe it\u2019s a good thing he does, turn out I wasn\u2019t unscathed, my chest has a big red mark in the shape of the grill, and it\u2019s a bit tender, but that\u2019s it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure that doesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt only hurts a little, please I\u2019m fine!\u201d I insist one last time before he concedes and let\u2019s me put me shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well...\u201d He turns back to his desk and takes out a nurse\u2019s note and hands it to me. \u201cHere, you may be seated- but if you start feeling any pain or anything else don\u2019t hesitate to use that to go to the nurse.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to sit down I sigh and pull my books out, acutely aware of everyone staring at me... until Grayson smacks his book on his podium, nonverbally demanding all eyes on him as he once more goes into full hardass mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass passes pretty normally from there and the tenderness in my chest gets better instead of worse, and no new pains or problems pop up elsewhere. A few friends ask me if I\u2019m okay, and a few assholes waste no time heckling me the moment Grayson\u2019s back is turned, but other than that geometry passes normally and it\u2019s time to head off to my next class... of course, it\u2019s at that point my bladder points out that I haven\u2019t emptied it yet today, good thing I have five minutes to get to my next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk into the bathroom, stroll up to the stall and zip down to let the beast out and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course... as fate would have it I\u2019m not allowed to piss in peace, as the moment the door closes from my passing, it\u2019s immediately thrown open... and a glance over confirms the culprit\u2019s Chase and Lorenzo: both jocks with more muscle then brains, and a need to assert themselves as alphas anyway they can. Now, that would be fine... I\u2019m no twerp, I could take both of them in a fight and they should know it, they learned that the hard way, after all. So instead of picking a fight or pushing me around what they do is play dirty. I sigh and hold it in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey truck-bait, how\u2019s it hanging?\u201d Chase asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey take the urinals flanking mine... here we go again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, truck bait, nice... Probably same as last time; short, am I right?\u201d Lorenzo elbows me, saw that coming, hence why I\u2019m holding it at the moment. Also I\u2019m not short, my dick is on the larger side of average. Normally that would be a good thing, except... the only thing these two morons are compensating for are their damn brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both zip down and make a point of flopping as much of their junk out as they can, balls and everything, if you guessed that both of them are twice my size, congratulations you win a cookie. It\u2019s just what they do, if you don\u2019t kiss up to them they throw their muscles around, and if you can beat the snot out of them, like me, they dick shame you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase grins like the cat that caught the canary as he helicopters his member and Lorenzo chuckles as he jerks his... then they both shove up next to me and shove their dongs into my urinal and start pissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww what\u2019s the matter? Pee shy?\u201d Chase asks innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr are you a homophobe? You know that bi is the new black, right? And hating gays is gay now, right?\u201d Lorenzo murmurs as he tries to shove his cock closer to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grit my teeth and growl. I\u2019d report these two assholes to the principal for sexual harassment, but the only other guy that I\u2019m aware of that they do this to, did just that, and they managed to turn it on him, seeing as he kicked their asses and already got suspended once for it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally I\u2019d just ignore them and wait till they finished and left,  but today... maybe it\u2019s my close brush with the reaper today, but I\u2019ve had it with both of them. I\u2019m thinking one good grab and squeeze or twist should give them both a good reason to leave me alone, maybe threaten to rip their junk off. Not that I could or would... though I have to admit it would be awesome if their junk just fell off or something... and maybe I could put them on like they were my own... err... wait, where did that thought come from? I mean I know I\u2019m kinda jealous of them but- Flick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down and see what happened, Chase has managed to squeeze close enough that his dick, that he\u2019s still passing out of by the way, is close enough to touch mine, and he flicked it with his! That does it, enough is enough! In one movement I let go of my own member and grab the two\u2019s junk right at their base\u2019s with one hand each. Both gasp as I squeeze. \u201cAlright this has gone on long enough, either you two stop it or-\u201c \u201cPop! Pop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral things happen at once, first a pair of loud pops echo in the bathroom and both cocks in my hand spray piss like firehoses for a split second before stopping entirely, all the while feeling heavier in my hands. I look down, and to my horror, both members are completely detached from their owners, and have taken their balls with them! Last but not least, Chase and Lorenzo:</span></div></div>",

Out of breath, I slam through the door and everyone stared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late, I got held up this morning\" I say struggling to breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take your seat, we will discuss this later, Mr. Johnson\" The teacher says angrily. Swiftly, I take to my seat in the middle of the class. Everyone is continuing to look at me and filling me with nervousness. To help cope with everyone looking at me, I start to play with my finger. \"Okay everyone, I want you to open your text books to...\" The teacher continues but i start to tune him out. My finger feels a bit funny but I ignore it too. I'm too focused on getting everyones stares off me to notice how hard I'm pulling my finger. Suddenly, I hear a soft pop so I look down. I immediately start to panic at the sight of my disconnected finger in my hand. I notice that somehow by hand isn't bleeding at all and the place where my finger once was is now smoothed over with a layer of skin. Seemingly out of nowhere, the teacher shouts \" Mr. Johnson, pay attention!\". I get startled and and watch my detached finger get flung in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! I'm sorry I'll pay attention!\" I yell. Immediately after he looks away, I frantically search around the room for my finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is possible to attach a part to the wrong spot (putting a foot where your hand is supposed to go) but the part still maintains its original use (putting your nose on your stomach still allows you to smell from your nose).
