Along with him and his Dad, Thaddeus, his mother named Cathy, is a model/actress, and gets admired by people that adored her success, both in pictures and on film.  He has got a sister named Karen, who is twelve, and is part of the swimming team, competing in number of events for medals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both Cathy and Karen had got nothing to do with this scientific technology, Lewis himself was admired by Thaddeus\u2019 work, since he was only seven.  He eventually got so excited, that every time he tried on one subject to make things bigger and larger, would constantly fail time and time again.  The youngster may be sad by this, but he would be determined to make this failed project into his ambitious plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when it would take years later to be able to work on his Dad\u2019s project, but only when he\u2019s alone, since his father had prohibited anyone going to the Lab unattended.  But Lewis would do this against his wishes and tries to see if these inventions can make it work, something which his father had failed to do some years before.</span></div></div>",

He was a bit eager to get to the Lab, which is only the two places his Dad works, both at home and in the Laboratory building.  Although he wouldn\u2019t be able to go in the main building, he does go in the basement, which is the other Lab is stationed, but only when he\u2019s alone, since his Dad wouldn\u2019t allow his son to get in when he\u2019s here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis may be patient as such, but his heart was beating so much, his mind always made him think about the invention that gone so wrong from the past, and he feels he can be the one to fix this problem.  Luckily, this is gonna be a busy weekend, when he can hear his Dad\u2019s voice, knowing that he\u2019s going away just now, much to a delight from Lewis at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Lewis, that\u2019s me away!  Try and not entering my Lab while I\u2019m gone, would you?\u201d  Thaddeus asked as he was at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Dad, I won\u2019t do anything near your stuff.\u201d  Lewis lied as if his Dad was gonna trust him with that wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see you when I\u2019m back home!\u201d  Thaddeus response with a smile before shutting the door and heads over to the Lab building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lewis heard the car set off, he grinned knowing his plan worked like a charm, and it was time to head over to fix this failed invention.  It\u2019s inside the basement downstairs, and Lewis made no hesitation but to go through the door and entered the Lab to look for an item he\u2019s working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where is that invention?  Oh, there it is!\u201d  Lewis says happily as he had found his invention he was after, which is actually a...</span></div></div>",

It was some lotion of liquid that had many glasses with a heater underneath the bigger glass.  It was bubbling up nicely, which he knew it would take a while to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I think this comes up nicely indeed.\u201d  Lewis says with some confident look to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019ll be glad that it was the final stage of the experiment, and so once it came at the right temperature, Lewis switches the heater off, before he uses his gloves to start pour into a small glass.  He would stir it in to give it good mix, and for a moment on, his Dad\u2019s work is complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, I\u2019ve able to finish it all off!  Now all I need to know if this stuffs really work?\u201d  Lewis may be delighted it\u2019s over, but he still have to wonder what this stuff does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly his Dad would know what was the purpose and what it was used for.  Lewis was beginning to be curious, and thought of an idea of letting his Dad know about the experiment he managed to finish it off.  But then again, he could end up getting into trouble, since he was told not to go to his Dad\u2019s Lab by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take a while to come up with other ideas, but the only choice to test things out, if he could drink it and see what happens.  It may be a great risk to take, but he feels he may not be able to see the finished experiment again, so he knew he needed to find out for himself.  Lewis grabbed a glass full of lotion liquid, and takes a huge sigh by saying as much as he was very nervous from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here goes nothing!\u201d  Lewis says and drinks the whole glass and swallowed it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would then wait for a moment, which sometimes it takes a while to take some effect to happen.  Lewis was about to move away from the Lab quickly, when he felt something strange inside of him, and clutched his stomach as if he lotion liquid had started to take effect.  It only took a couple of seconds until Lewis...</span></div></div>",

Her Mother being original from an Asian territory and her Father hailing from Hawaii. Her parents met at a airport and the rest was history. They moved to America 11-years ago. Where her father worked continued his work as a scientist.  You see he's been working on some inventions that can cause things to be enlarged. Thaddeus was inspired to create such a thing while he was living in Hawaii. As he seen people around the world hungry. The droughts America had faced so many times, how Africa just didn't have enough food to go around and just how harsh our environment is to our crops and farm lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the years he's spent on this has been... less than remotely successful. Either the food doesn't grow at all or just simply overloads and explodes! Making quite a mess to say the least. Mei has watched her father work on this invention ever since she could walk. And she really wanted to help her father succeed, but he appreciated her offer to help out, but kindly explained to her that this was a complex device and she would only hinder the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough one day.

Thaddeus met her at an European Inventor's convention, they shared the same passion of trying to help increase food and quite possibly livestock resources by enlarging safely and effectively. One thing led to someone's hotel room, then the two settled down, had two children; Helena and her sister Vonnah, who is 12; and decided to continue to pursuit their efforts at a research facility a few miles from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena is the tallest of her family, Thaddeus at 5'11\", Ivanika at 5'7\", and Vonnah at 5'3\". She also loves flaunting and using her size to get her way. Her parents being quite successful and often very involved in their work, she kinda developed a brat like personality so she often gets what she wants. Now that a recent spurt of puberty hit her, Helena shot up and quite a bit out, since she also developed into DD cup and a very bubbly behind. She interestingly enough does not like being, well, so big. In fact, she would dread being even taller than she is now.<br>\r\nAs much as she doesn't quite understand how all their experiments in the basement lab worked; she truly does want her mother and father to succeed in their careers and would like to help in some way but couldn't think of how.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then heard a couple of knocks on her door, \"Yeah?\" Helena answered without looking away from the screen. \"Hey sweetie, it's dad. Your mother and I need to run to work for the day, one of the researchers wasn't able to come in so we are going in to catch up. We'll be back in time for dinner so please watch your sister and the house, okay?\" Helena puts her phone down, sighs quietly, and sits upright, \"Got it. Have fun guys.\" Her dad responds, \"Thank you, you as well!\" She hears footsteps leaving the front of her door, then going down the stairs. \"Ready dear?\" her mom said, \"Just about!\" Helena heard the front door open then close, no other sound afterwards. \"Ughh, now I'm get to be bored and watch Vonnah too, freaking great!\" she said with a sarcastic tone. She stood up and walked to her door when a strange thought entered her mind. \"Wait,\" Helena thought, \"I think Vonnah is still sleeping in and since Mom and Dad are gone, maybe it's time to check out the basement for once\"<br>\r\nHelena has always been curious of what they been working on at home but either they were working down there or they kept it locked. It's not like she wasn't interested in their work, it's more like she wants to do things her own way, without showing she does. She opens her door stealthily, trying not to cause her sister to wake up, and walks to the stairs. Being a very tall, stacked teenager, she can only be so quiet going down the staircase. Luckily, she made it down without any incident and went toward the basement door. She reaches for the handle, \"Watch as it's locked anyways,\" but the door opened, much to Helena's suprise. She then thought, \"Well, they did kinda leave in a hurry so maybe they forgot. Might as well check it out.\"<br>\r\nShe proceeds to go into the basement, finding that it was actually quite spacious with lots of beakers of different sizes, various gadgets and the such on long tables. On one side of the room was a large device as big as a refrigerator, it looked like a big ray gun like something from a scfi movie. She walked closer to the tables to inspect what was there; there was a unmarked bottle of what appears to be lotion, a glass flask of bright green liquid with a slight fruity aroma, and a tv remote with a few buttons and knobs. Helena was thinking of checking out the lotion and the flask, the remote crossed her mind as well as the device across the room.<br>\r\nWhat shall she take a look at first?</span></div></div>",
