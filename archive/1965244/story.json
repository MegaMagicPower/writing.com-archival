He was really skinny, and tall, which seemed to make muscle mass impossible to show. He didn't try as well, so his genetics are not the only ones to be blamed. Make it worse, his manhood was nothing to brag about, so he was really shy. Two inches are not what women are looking for, bones aren't either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always was envious of the jocks of the football team, and he always desired to be the boyfriend of one of the gorgeous cheerleaders. However, he was not so good looking, and his low self steem didn't help. He was really smart, but he couldn't talk to girls because of his problems. Pitiful, isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, his luck was going to change. But, how?</span></div></div>",

He was really good at it, because he was smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something had been bothering him that day. A huge jock bully punched him on the left arm, for no apparent reason, and it obviously hurt. Damn, he wished to be strong like that, but to protect people and hopefully meet a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy arrived really early. That day, they had a huge container in the lab. It was filled with a green fluid. The liquid was so thick that you wouldn't know if there was something inside the container besides the green goo. Andy was intrigued by that container, and got closer to it. It seemed like his teacher was about to test something, before classes. Professor Eddie Vil was brilliant, and kind of creepy. He was short, skinny, and bald, and he looked weak and old because of his body composition. However, he was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was really curious about the content of that container, so he got a chair and he stood on it to have a better view of the inside. He was peeking above the edge of the recipient. He got careless, and he fell inside the green stuff. In that exact moment, Professor switched on a machine that sent an electrical pulse through the container. Andy couldn't get up because the shock paralyzed him. He couldn't breath and he was swallowing the weird liquid, which tasted like metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy finally managed to get up and out from the container, and he knew he had to run away before Professor saw him. He didn't know Professor saw him escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy? Oh, no... My formula isn't ready.\" said Eddie. Andy got to his room, which was nearby, without being noticed. He wasn't noticed anyways. Andy had to change his wet clothes, and take a shower. By the way, he didn't even know what kind of chemical he was exposed to, but he was feeling odd... Something was not OK... He was feeling better than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been a medicinal mixture! I feel terrific!\" said Andy, while stripping clothes. He had a full length mirror in his bedroom, though he didn't like it. He could swear his reflection was becoming blurry in the mirror, though his vision wasn't bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something happened...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the sensation intensified, and power was spasming all over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" he panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscle mass started to grow on all his body. He looked like a lean athlete in just a second. His penis grew two inches in the blink of an eye. Veins started to pop out, so he looked vascular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it. It was so fast... But he felt hell strong!! Changes were barely starting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his newly formed softball biceps, and all his body started packing on muscle mass. His twiggy arms were replaced by mammoth biceps, triceps, and forearms. His stick legs became oaks as hard as diamonds. He developed a 10-pack, and his glutes and back grew impressively. His cock got 12 inch long flaccid, and 14 erected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also grew a feet in height in matter of seconds. He was so excited. He flexed his cannonball biceps and he realized he was a bodybuilder, similar to Evan Centopani (all muscle, all veins, all power). He felt amazing. </span></div></div>",

When Andy finally noticed that the lawn mower was approaching him, he was startled and he leaped in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maintenance man who was seated in the lawn mower had to slam on the brakes because what he saw Andy do next was just totally amazing! </span></div></div>",

Then, as he jumped into the air, his feet left the grass and his entire body went airborne! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy SHIT!\" Andy screamed as he started to soar across the sky, ascending rapidly and heading towards the sky. \"WHHAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy started to PANIC! What the hell was happening? He was just flying through the air on his own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy then pointed his arms a little more straight, making his body now fly over the ground and level out rather than ascend rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief! Okay... Keep calm.... Stay calm...\" he sighed, as he took a deep breath. \"I... I'm flying.... Ohmygod... I'm freaking FLYING...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and became SCARED for a moment, as he saw the houses, the buildings and the cars below him. Everything seemed so small for him as he realized how high he was above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be thousands of feet above the ground! OH NO! How... How do I LAND?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he realized that he could control his airspeed by thinking of it. If he wanted to slow down, he just willed his body to fly slower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I just want to stop flying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his flying slowed down until he came to a complete stop, leaving him hovering in mid-air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! It worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Now, let me fly lower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew towards a grass field and then he slowed down until he was just a few feet above the ground, until he was floating. Then, with his shoes pointing towards the ground, he slowly descended to the ground until his shoes touched down on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on a field, close to the street. He walked towards the street where he spotted a small sign. He read the sign which indicated that he was on a field close to a small town which was over fifty miles away from his house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I'm 50 miles away from home! I gotta go back home!\" Andy sighed. \"I just flew 50 miles in under a minute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he looked over, he noticed that he was most likely exceeding the posted speed limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, he realized he had already entered his town. Then, he ran down his familiar streets until he reached his house. Then he got into the house and ran up the stairs to his bedroom, where he saw his reflection in his full-body mirror for the first time since he had his growth spurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Andy exclaimed as he examined his own reflection in the mirror. His muscles were far bigger and more defined than he had expected. His pectorals were large, barge spheres of muscles and his biceps were bulging out of his arms. He had a six pack abdominal muscles as well, which were as hard and as defined as a washboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he stood there, before the mirror, something happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Additionally, he was well-endowed now, putting most Earth men to shame (if not every man). He flexed his  big muscles, enjoying how hard and full they became. Veins popped everywhere, mapping his torso and his legs, pumping more energy and power than a nuclear reactor ever could. He flexed in front of the mirror for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I always dreamed to have a strong, buff body. I even wished to have super powers... Now I have them, and I look awesome. I became a man... No, I'm more than that. I became a ripped athlete, a muscular bodybuilder, a super developed superman. And I'm not talking only about my big body, but also about this huge hose I've got here!\" said Andy, grabbing his enormous 14 inch penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt more power building inside his body. An intense heat warned him about what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm awesome now, and I still can grow? Yes! Even more power! No one will ever push me around! I'll save tons of people! Power, flood me and make me grow MORE!!!\" said Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held a double bicep pose while the new transformation was taking effect. His biceps were big as basket balls. The veins were pumping so much power that his biceps started to inflate to beach ball proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs were like truck tires. His back looked like a waterfall of meat. His triceps became like soft balls. His legs put on more muscular fibers until they looked like Coliseum columns. His six pack became an 8 pack, and it looked even more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock started to grow, and it became 18 inches long when erected. He also started inching upwards until he was 8 feet, and 500 lbs of  muscle and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome\" said Andy, feeling the incredible strength of his new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed all his muscles, and the sight of his impressive body made him cum all over the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... How am I supposed to go on with life looking like this? No clothes will fit me! And many people will freak out if they see me... A normal life would not be possible with such a huge, sexy body.2 said Andy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he could try to somehow command his body to shrink a little bit, just to get a manageable size. A way big, sexy, but more normal bodybuilder size.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He was hungry like a bear and he shared a pizza with his roommate Logan, who was really cool. Logan and Billy were both into sports, although Logan was a few inches taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan had ordered a pepperoni pizza and Billy had split it with him. Both boys had finished the pizza in no time and Billy went to bed shortly afterwards. He did some work on his laptop while he lay in bed before he shut down the laptop and grabbed his pillow. He was out like a light in five minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Billy woke up around 6:30 in the morning, his t-shirt felt incredibly tight around his chest and his torso. So tight, in fact, that it almost felt like his t-shirt was about to rip at the seams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly got up and slowly stood up, stretching his arms as he let out a yawn. As he inhaled deeply, his t-shirt ripped down the middle, from his collar all the way down to his stomach! Not only that, but Billy felt heavier and bigger. What happened? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly walked to the bathroom, trying his best to be as quiet as possible since Logan was still sound asleep. But, he knew that Logan had to wake up any minute now since he had class early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Billy stood in the bathroom and examined his reflection in the mirror, he gasped out loud! For the moment, it seemed like a total stranger was looking back at him. A young guy with big, bulging biceps, large, round pectorals and impressive abdominal muscles was staring back at him! Where did those muscles come from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d he whispered to himself, as he extended his muscular arm and ran his hand over his chest and over his other arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very impressed by his amazing physique! It seemed as if he had gained over forty pounds of muscle overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 No way\u2026 I gotta be dreaming this\u2026\u201d he sighed, as he slowly walked out of the bathroom, finding that Logan had just woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 Uhmm\u2026 Logan?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLogan? Can I\u2026 Umm\u2026\u201d he began to ask as he walked up to his roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Billy?\u201d Logan asked, before he looked up and noticed his roommate\u2019s improved physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat Scott!\u201d Logan exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2026 What the hell happened to YOU?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 Uhh\u2026 I-I-I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know?\u201d Logan replied, feeling a bit annoyed. \u201cLast night you looked like an average freshman in college and this morning you\u2019re like all big and buff? Nobody grows that fast!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly just stared at him with his usual really shy expression on his face. In a way, now that Billy had his huge muscles, his shy expression made him look even more innocent and shy-looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026 Can I borrow some clothes from you?\u201d Billy asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re taller than me, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, dude\u2026 I mean\u2026 I don\u2019t know how you got so buff overnight\u2026 I mean\u2026 Are those muscles for real?\u201d Logan wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly just shrugged in silence as he continued to give Logan that shy look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, big guy! Put your elbow on the table!\u201d Logan ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly always followed Logan\u2019s orders since Logan was bigger than him. Billy clasped his fingers around Logan\u2019s hand, and he closed his fingers in a tight grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the count of three, try to bring my hand down to the table, okay?\u201d Logan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne\u2026 Two\u2026 Three!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan tensed his muscles in his arm and tried his best to bring Billy\u2019s arm down, but Billy was able to resist him without much effort. In fact, he was able to withstand his pressure without using any force at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Billy applied just minimal strength, and his arm started to push Logan\u2019s arm down, bringing Logan\u2019s knuckles closer to the table. Then, in one swift move, Billy forced Logan\u2019s arm down to the table, without any effort at all, while pressing Logan\u2019s hand to the wooden table top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly SHIT!\u201d Logan shouted. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly immediately let go of Logan\u2019s hand. He really didn\u2019t expect to beat him that easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLogan\u2026 I-I-I\u2019m s-s-sorry\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Billy stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDUDE!\u201d Logan shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re FREAKING STRONG!\u201d he said, while shaking the numbness out of his hand. \u201cYou have NEVER beaten me in arm wrestling before!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-s-sorry\u2026\u201d Billy whispered, feeling more shy and embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas being super strong a good thing? Could he handle his strength? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, Billy would never go to the weight room on campus, but this time he went anyway just because Logan insisted he come along with him. They walked up to the building and walked in, scanning their ID\u2019s as they entered through the door. Once inside, they went to the locker room where they changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan looked at Billy and noticed that Billy had appeared to have gained even more muscle. His shoulders looked even broader than before and his chest seemed even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Are you getting stronger on me?\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re already freaking strong as it is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d Billy shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026\u201dLogan sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s try and see how much you can lift and what your maximum is\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked back into the weight room and they went right up to the bench press. Logan pointed at the bench and Billy quietly laid down on his back. Logan loaded about 100 pounds of weights and then he ordered Billy to lift the bar while Logan stood behind the bar and spotted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly grabbed hold of the bar with his hands and he easily lifted the bar off the rack, lowering it down to his chest before raising it as far as he could, extending his arms all the way. It seemed like the bar was too light for him. After three reps, Logan asked him to place the bar on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan added two plates of 100 pounds each to the bar, thinking this would give Billy a challenge. Then, he walked back to the rack and told Billy to lift the bar and give him a few reps. The bar now weighed about 300 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Billy lifted the bar off the rack with eased, almost as if the additional 200 pounds didn\u2019t make any difference to him. He lowered the bar to his chest and then he raised it up as far as he could go, flexing his arms and his chest. In fact, Billy didn\u2019t even seem to be straining!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly cranked out 3\u2026 4\u2026 5 reps and it seemed like he could just keep on going without even getting tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay dude\u2026 Stop! Put it back. That was 300 pounds!\u201d Logan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly obeyed and returned the bar to the rack. He didn\u2019t even break out in a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to make this a little more challenging\u2026\u201d Logan sighed, as he pulled two more 100-pound plates from the steel rack on the floor.  He added another 200 pounds to Billy\u2019s bar, realizing that he was going to ask his roommate to lift 500 pounds now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, bro\u2026 Try to lift that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly raised up his arms\u2026 His muscular arms\u2026 Did his arms suddenly seem\u2026 bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly grabbed the bar and gently pulled it off the rack. His breathing remained the same, and he remained just as calm and quiet. It didn\u2019t seem to require any extra effort on his part. Then, he lowered the bar and raised it up again. He didn\u2019t groan or moan or anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on\u2026 don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not any heavier to you!\u201d Logan grumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re lifting 500 pounds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo big deal\u2026\u201d Billy grinned, as he raised and lowered the bar, cranking out one rep after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan decided to remain quiet. He let Billy do a few reps until he got tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Billy did 3 reps\u2026 4\u2026 5\u2026 6\u2026 This was getting crazy\u2026 8\u2026 9\u2026 10\u2026 Logan couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing\u2026 14\u2026 15\u2026 16\u2026 Logan gasped out loud\u2026 19\u2026 20\u2026 21\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is impossible! You\u2019re lifting 500 pounds and you\u2019ve done over 21 reps?\u201d Logan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Billy said calmly. \u201cDo I need to keep on going?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did rep number 27\u2026 28\u2026 29\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough! Stop!\u201d Logan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly set the bar back on the rack after he had completed rep number 30. Logan was completely astonished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan just stared at the bar for a minute. He was looking at 500 pound of steel! And Billy was casually lifting it like it was cardboard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! No way he can lift THIS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan finally added two more 100-pound plates. The bar now held 700 pounds of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Billy. Try lifting the bar NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly placed his hands on the bar and casually lifted the bar off the rack, just like all the other times before. He lowered the bar and raised it up again, like it was nothing. To Billy, it seemed like he was lifting a piece of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no! Something weird is going on here!\u201d Logan shouted. \u201cPut it back on the rack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly quietly obeyed and re-racked the 700-pound bar with weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly stood up and walked away from the weight bench. Then Logan quickly got on his back and laid down on the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan wrapped his fingers around the bar, he gritted his teeth and concentrated. Then he tensed his muscles and gave it all he got. All he wanted to do is just lift the bar off the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026. RRRRRAAAAAAARRRHHHHHHH!!!!!\u201d Logan roared out loud, causing his arms and the bar to tremble slightly. He managed to raise the bar up by just an INCH before he had to let the bar drop back on the rack. He just couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t lift 700 pounds. He didn\u2019t have the strength to lift that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Logan hopped off the bench and stared at Billy, who was giving him his usual shy glance. Logan was panting and sweating already from his brief, failed effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t lift\u2026 that much\u2026 weight\u2026 Billy\u201d he said while gasping for air. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 just\u2026 way stronger\u2026 than me\u2026 and\u2026 everybody else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly just stared at him in silence when it started to hit him how strong he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201d Billy whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll help you, dude!\u201d Logan said calmly. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s take a shower and go to class!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two students returned to the locker room where they showered before they headed back to campus for their afternoon calculus class which they had together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Billy had studied for it the night before and he knew all the answers to all the questions. He was the first one to finish and he got up and handed in his test sheet before walking out of the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Darla and Logan walked out, talking as they closed the classroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, umm\u2026 Darla? Have you noticed anything weird about your brother lately?\u201d Logan asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther than the fact that he\u2019s an introvert and he\u2019s smart and incredibly shy?\u201d she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarla\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you guys did last night, but ever since this morning, there\u2019s something different about Billy!\u201d Logan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarla\u2026 Billy is super-freaking-strong\u2026 and I mean\u2026 like superhuman strong!\u201d Logan explained. \u201cI took him to the weight room an hour ago and he was able to bench press more than 700 pounds without even breaking a sweat!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla stopped walking and turned towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You mean, Billy? My super-shy brother, Billy? No way!\u201d she said out loud. \u201cI find that very hard to believe!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then they walked out of the building and towards the parking lot. They wandered over to where her small SUV was parked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother just participates on the wrestling team because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be into sports at all! He\u2019s no bodybuilder or muscle man! A guy who lifts over 700 pounds would have to be a big muscle freak and Billy isn\u2019t like that at all! I can\u2019t believe what you\u2019re saying, Logan! I\u2014Oh no!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to her car she saw that her car had a flat tire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man! I have a flat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Billy came walking by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bro! What\u2019s all this about you being really strong?\u201d Darla said to him. Billy just stared at her and at Logan before he rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, dude! She\u2019s your sister and I had to tell her, okay?\u201d Logan explained to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla unlocked her car and pointed out where her spare tire was. She had a wrench and everything necessary to change the tire and Logan started to help her. But when it came time to get the jack to lift up the front of the car, Billy had beaten him to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is the jack? Ohh\u2026 HEY!\u201d Logan gasped, as he felt the front of the car rise up off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan and Darla quickly jumped out of the SUV to see Billy, standing in front of the car, holding the entire front of the vehicle about two feet above the ground with one hand casually under the front bumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBILLY! How\u2026 What\u2026 Do you know how heavy this is?\u201d Logan shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh\u2026\u201d Darla gasped. \u201cBILLY! You\u2019re lifting and holding up my car like it weighs\u2026 NOTHING!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you to change the tire!\u201d Billy said calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan quickly grabbed the wrench and loosened the nuts holding the flat tire in place. He then removed the tire and replaced it with the spare, before tightening and replacing the nuts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can set her down, Billy!\u201d Logan said when he was all done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly slowly lowered the front of the SUV until both tires touch the ground. Then, he let go of the bumper and stepped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly! How did you get so strong?\u201d Darla asked him as she walked up to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d he just shrugged. \u201cI woke up this morning and I just felt really strong!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 We got wrestling practice with Coach Tsunami in twenty minutes!\u201d Logan reminded them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? Wrestling with your new superhuman strength? That I gotta see!\u201d Darla grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were later joined by Rick as they walked over to the large gym where wrestling practice sessions were being held. Nobody saw coming what was about to happen when one of their wrestlers would walk in with superhuman strength\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Billy was walking behind them, as usual, as the group was heading towards the locker rooms in order to let those who were going to wrestling practice change into their wrestling uniforms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m checking our test scores\u2026\u201d Darla said, as she was tapping on her smartphone. \u201cWhoa! Billy! You got the highest score! You aced this morning\u2019s Sports Medicine 101 Test! Holy cow! Billy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Darla turned around and she saw Billy walking a little slower, until he stopped and leaned against the wall for a moment with his eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly? BILLY!\u201d she shouted, as she ran towards her brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Billy mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m just feeling\u2026 a slight cramp\u2026 in all my\u2026 muscles\u2026\u201d Billy groaned for a brief moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay? Do you need to see a doctor? Do we need to take you home?\u201d Darla asked him. \u201cAre you feeling sick?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m okay\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026 Just\u2026 Growing\u2026\u201d Billy groaned. \u201cUuuuuuhhhhhhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBILLY!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly closed his eyes really tight and then he craned his neck. At the same time, he closed his fists and he gritted his teeth before letting out a soft growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Logan asked Darla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick and Linda also joined them and they all witnessed Billy\u2019s amazing growth spurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Billy\u2019s chest grew even bigger as it pushed out further, filling out Billy\u2019s wrestling singlet. His biceps inflated like balloons as well, and his abdominal muscles just became legendary! His quads grew even more layers of muscle, growing thicker, wider and deeper at the same time, while his calves added another three inches in width! Billy became even MORE muscular, just within a few seconds, while Darla, Rick, Linda and Logan looked on in complete amazement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten seconds had passed, Billy\u2019s strange growth spurt stopped. Billy was completely covered in sweat! He slowly opened his eyes and stared around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBILLY! Ohmygosh! BILLY! Are you alright?\u201d Darla was shouting at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood grief! Did you see THAT? His muscles grew before our very eyes!\u201d Logan exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang! His muscles just got bigger!\u201d Rick noted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d Linda shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBILLY! SAY SOMETHING!\u201d Darla screamed at him. \u201cTALK TO ME! I hate it when you don\u2019t talk to me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026. Ohhh wow!\u201d Billy said, while looking around the room. \u201cI\u2026 I feel different\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What are you feeling? Are you hurt? In pain?\u201d Darla insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not at all!\u201d Billy replied calmly. \u201cI\u2019m like\u2026 stronger\u2026 super-duper-strong\u2026. But my muscles aren\u2019t the only things that are getting stronger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Darla asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy muscles are getting stronger, but so is my mind!\u201d Billy responded calmly. \u201cMy mind is becoming really, really powerful\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich explains why you\u2019re acing all your tests?\u201d Darla smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re super smart now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of it!\u201d Billy smiled. \u201cBut, my mind can do a lot more than just ace college exams!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhm\u2026 I hate to say this, but\u2026 Wrestling practice starts in five minutes!\u201d Logan shouted. \u201cWe need to change!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys then ran to the locker room where they changed. The girls then sat down in the bleachers as they waited for the boys to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Rick, Logan and Billy emerged, all dressed up in their wrestling singlet and shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they just waited their turn on the mat. Coach Tsunami came out and introduced the players and the assistant coaches before starting the first round of matches, while the girls in the bleachers just cheered on the wrestlers from their own school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly held on to his wrestling ear guards (ear protectors) until he was called to the mat. He was already wearing his singlet and his high top wrestling sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he was called to the mat and was told to face another boy named Ben. Coach Tsunami had already noticed that Billy looked more muscular than before. He wondered out loud whether or not Billy was lifting weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee indicated the start of the match and Billy immediately locked his arms around Ben\u2019s arms. The two started pushing each other, but Billy was clearly much stronger than Ben and he pushed him out of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the match restarted, Billy grabbed Ben by the shoulder and by the crotch and he easily lifted Ben\u2019s entire body up into the air, with Ben moving his legs as he was trying to desperately break free from Billy\u2019s mighty grip. But, it was useless, as Billy lifted Ben high over his head before he dropped Ben onto the mat before him like a sack of potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Billy jumped on top of Ben\u2019s body, pinning his shoulders to the ground as the referee looked on. As soon as the referee counted down, Billy was declared the winner by the fall. Everybody in the crowd gasped at Billy\u2019s easy victory over Ben, who was bigger and taller than Billy. But, Billy won because he was much stronger than Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Billy sat down, several of the other boys on the team sat next to him and they started asking him questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Billy! How did you get to be so strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Did you start working out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did all those muscles come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince when did you get so strong that you could beat a guy like Ben?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly just shrugged and smiled as the kids all looked at him with confusion and admiration, all at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the small competition was over, Billy went into the locker room and changed. When he came out of the locker room, he was greeted by Darla, Linda, Rick and Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s our muscle-man!\u201d Logan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, bro! You made your wrestling match look easy!\u201d Darla said, as she hugged her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody noticed how Billy looked bigger and more muscular than before. What else could happen to Billy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Logan and Billy returned to the dorm room late that night. It was already dark, and most guys were asleep. Billy was in front this time, so he got his key out and unlocked the door. When he opened the door, thanks to his enormous strength, he pulled the lock off the door along with the doorknob! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Billy groaned, holding the doorknob in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man! Billy! What did you do?\" Logan groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly quietly showed the broken doorknob which he held in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Hold back on the muscle, will you?\" Logan sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Billy whispered. \"I can't help it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Hercules....\" Logan grinned, as he hugged Billy in an embrace. It felt amazing just to feel Billy's rock hard abs and his big, bulging pectorals. It was hard to believe that Billy was just an average guy a few days ago and he now had the physique of a teenage bodybuilder. \"My goodness, you've become so strong! Incredible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan stepped back and looked his roommate over. Billy looked absolutely amazing. He was a pillar of strength, a true Adonis. Billy's chest was as hard as granite and his abs were as hard as steel. His biceps were bigger than melons and harder than bowling balls. Logan was just happy that his roommate, this shy guy named Billy, was the one with super strength and not some guy who was a bully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some sleep, my muscle man!\" Logan ordered. \"I'll have the maintenance guy fix the door in the morning. Don't worry about that! Go to bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly loved Logan. He did everything Logan told him without question. Billy accepted Logan as the alpha and the leader of the dorm room and even now, when Billy was the stronger guy, Logan was still the leader in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly just nodded and changed into his shorts before he crawled in his bed. He was asleep in less than a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Billy woke up the following morning, he walked into the bathroom. He took a razor blade and was about to insert it into the razor so he could shave when he snapped the plastic razor in half with his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! I need to stop breaking things! Why am I so clumsy! This has to stop!\" He groaned, when he suddenly realized something. It dawned on him that he could use his mind to touch small things without breaking them! His mind had become so powerful, that he could move objects just by concentrating on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly stepped back from the bathroom counter and took a deep breath. Then, things began to happen right before him, like magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drawer opened up in the bathroom counter without Billy touching it. A new razor came flying out of the open drawer and landed on the counter. A razor blade came out of the package and attached to the head of the razor. Finally, the can of shaving cream flew up to Billy's face and sprayed cream into his hands. After billy rubbed cream over his face, the razor magically slid over his cream-covered face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly rinsed his face with water, and a towel flew to his face and dried him off afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, this is nice!\" Billy smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly turned to the shower and the water turned on by itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, billy had showered and dried off. He was in the dorm room, making his t-shirt fly from the dresser and go over his head and slide over his muscular torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Logan gasped. \"How did you do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan caught Billy using his new telekinetic powers! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well... \" Billy stuttered. \"How do I explain this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan just stood there and grinned with his arms folded before his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Logan's feet started to leave the floor. He was floating a foot above the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the--- put me down!\" Logan gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can move things with my mind, just by thinking it!\" Billy explained. \"Cool, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan just stared at him with his jaw wide open in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This... This is just... Amazing!\" Logan said as he tried to move his legs as he floated in mid-air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. I'll set you back on the ground.\" Billy chuckled. Logan's body slowly descended to the ground until his feet touched down on the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Billy! You could do that to me all day long. What an amazing feeling!\" Logan grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can do other things, if you let me.\" Billy smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge smile appeared on Logan's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if you could just give me a fraction of your muscles and your strength then I would be so happy. You have no idea...\" Logan sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, umm.... Sure. I can do that, if you let me control the size of your muscles.\" Billy said calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it!\" Logan replied without a hint of hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but, remember that if I do this, my powers might control other parts of your body as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan just shrugged in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly then walked right up to Logan and placed his hands on Logan's forehead. This caused Logan to moan softly, as power flowed from Billy's hands into Logan's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. We're linked together now\" Billy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly then took a few steps back so he could get a good view of his roommate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Logan was overcome by an intense cramping up in all his muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaarrrhhhh.....\" Logan groaned out loud, as every muscle in his body started to inflate, thanks to Billy's concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a period of only five seconds, Logan's pectorals bulged into mighty spheres of large, hard muscle. His shoulders became wider and his biceps grew into melons. His flat stomach grew into washboard abs while his quads became wider and deeper at the same time, adding layers of muscle above the knees. Finally, his calves grew into powerful soccer balls implanted on the back of his legs. When it stopped, Logan was completely amazed by his increased weight, strength and muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Logan cheered while looking down at his improved body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, billy stared at him with a big smile on his face as well, then his smile turned serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... Oh Logan...what have I done?\" Billy said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Logan replied while flexing his arms. \"I think it's great that you can control the size of my muscles!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...that's not all I can control...\" Billy sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan looked at him with a confused glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I control everything now! Your height, weight, muscles, strength, race, intelligence, language, color, eyes, hair, size, emotions, location.... Absolutely everything!\" Billy explained quietly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning he glared at his phone wondering who was calling him. His daughter Claire had just left for the day at the lake with friends, and Mark had been looking forward to a day alone. There had been a number of home projects piling up and it was the perfect time to get some of them done. Whoever was calling had better have a good reason for interrupting him.<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad.\"<br>\r\n\"Claire?\" Mark instantly went from enraged to concerned. He hadn't expected to hear from his daughter for at least another hour. \"Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" A sigh came down the line. \"The Bitch stopped working.\" The Bitch was Claire's car. I you could call her that. The thing was a monstrosity, made from a hodgepodge of other car parts from now to the eighties. She ran, most of the time. But she was high maintenance woman. You had to love her and please her, or she would just stop in the middle of the road. She had been Mark's first car and he had never found a reason to get rid of her until he handed Claire the Keys on her sixteenth birthday. \"Do you think you could come pick us up? We're only a couple miles out of town. At the rest stop\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I will.\" Mark assured her. \"I'll be there soon.\" Hanging up he sighed, looking around the smoked glass walls and ceiling of the pool room.It, and the spacious house, had been one of the many ways Mark had indulged his wife. She had been delighted at the heated pool she could use year round, and a house big enough for all the children they planed to have. Even after she had passed the pool and house still got plenty of use, to Mark's delight and frustration. He was happy to see that Claire always had friends over. Unfortunately those friends were uniformly young, attractive girls, often prancing around the house in small bikinis. More than once Mark had retreated to the master bathroom to relive the tension to the image of one of his daughter's friends writhing beneath him. Shaking his head, Mark retrieved his keys and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Mark pulled into a parking spot next to the Bitch and the three girls surrounding it. His daughter waved at him as he got out of his truck. They young redhead was the spitting image of her mother, from her long, lithe frame to her freckled skin. More than once he had rounded a corner and found his wife's name on his lips when he saw Claire. On the Bitch's roof was tall Martha, laying down on a towel. The thick bodied girl's caramel skin contrasted with the white fabric of her bikini. Then there was Tina, the fierce Latina, decked out in leather. She had a small radio in her hand listening to the forecast.<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad!\" Claire walked over to give him a hug, \"Glad you could make it.\"<br>\r\n\"I wasn't about to leave my little girl stranded.\" Mark glanced at his daughter car. \"No Ling today?\"<br>\r\n\"Her parents had 'plans',\" Martha sat up, with her customary scowl that she got when she talked about her girlfriend's parents. Mark knew for a fact that they were the only parents in his daughters group to NOT know about Ling's relationship with Martha. Everyone who did know conspired to keep the conservative couple in the dark until the little China doll was ready to tell her parents. With a snarl that Mark knew wasn't directed at him, Martha hopped off the roof and changed the subject. \"How did you keep this hunk of junk running anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"Virgin sacrifice.\" Mark deadpanned. Martha scoffed. \"No seriously.\" He opened the back door and pointed at the seat. \"See that dark stain right there in the middle? That's were Claire's mom lost her virginity.\" There was a moment of silence as the girls processed that information, thinking about how often they that on that stain.<br>\r\n\"Ewwww!\"<br>\r\n\"Dad! I did not need to know that!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,guys?\" Tina looked up from her radio. \"You need to hear this.\" She cranked up the volume.<br>\r\n<i>\"...Get inside. There is a large lightning storm moving down highway 67 at high speeds. Be advised that everyone needs to get off the road and under cover or to get inside. Repeat. Get inside.</i><br>\r\nThe foursome looked at the sky. Lightning storm was a very accurate description. The storm appeared to be made of nothing <i>but</i> lightning. Heads swiveled towards the bathrooms. \"Run!\"<br>\r\nMark had almost made it to the building, when he tripped. He skidded on the pavement hard. Groaning he got to his feet. He was to late. White hot fire coursed through his veins and thunder roared in his ears. Everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened his eyes a groaned. Everything part of his body was sore. And the world was blurry. He tried to sit up and was pushed back down by gentle hands. \"Don't try to get up. You were hit pretty hard.\" A soft voice murmured in his ear. Blinking, Mark turned his head to the side. A beautiful face swam into view. Perfect symmetry framed sapphire blue eyes. \"Do you know your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Mark Jibs.\" Focusing lower he say that the beautiful face was above a plain set of hospital scrubs. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"You were hit by lightning and thrown across a parking lot.\" That explained why everything hurt. Although he was starting to feel better already. \"You've been unconscious for about twelve hours.\" <br>\r\nMemories snapped into place. \"Claire!\" Mark struggled to sit up headless of the pain. The pretty nurse forced him back down.<br>\r\n\"Relax, your daughter's fine. She got under cover in time.\"<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Claire ran into the room. Sobbing, she hugged her father, \"You're okay!\"<br>\r\n\"Ow! Baby, everything hurts!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Claire stepped back. \"It's just you were on the ground and then you were flying and Martha wouldn't let me go and and... You're okay!\" Mark was silently grateful for the cool headed amazon who kept his daughter safe.<br>\r\nChuckling, in walked a doctor. \"Surprisingly considering your age and what you just went through. We were mostly just waiting for you to wake up. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n\"Sore. Not surprising if I took flying lessons.\" Mark frowned. \"I didn't break anything?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" The doctor smiled, \"being unconscious probably saved your life.\"<br>\r\n\"Other than that I feel okay.\" Mark didn't mention that everything felt fuzzy. Not in any conventional sense. But something was different. The doctor started talking and Mark mostly blanked him out. If nothing else Claire would remember everything for him. Mark's attention was instead focused on the gorgeous nurse that had come back into the room. Mark couldn't help but think about what see looked naked. Or at the very least, his eyes dropped down to gaze at her breasts, what her nipples looked like.<br>\r\nSuddenly the nurse looked right at him. Mark freezes realizing he's been caught staring, when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A blue spark leapt from Mark's arm, crossed the short distance from him to the nurse, and sank into her body. The nurse blinked, then smiled before slowly pulling up the hem of her shirt, reveling a surprisingly lacy bra. Still smiling she reached up and pulled down the supportive fabric to unveil breasts that were,<br>\r\nNot that great actually. The large orbs were clearly filled with silicone, remaining near perfect spheres even without a bra. Her nipples were sad things. Tiny pebbles sitting all alone on their expanses of flesh. The woman was clearly comfortable in her own skin, even with it hanging out for anyone to see. In Mark's opinion that still didn't mean that a fat man should wear a speedo.<br>\r\nThen Mark remembered where he was, in a hospital room with two other occupants. A place that woman, especially nurses, did not flash random strangers in. He whipped his head around to see that the doctor had turned to address Claire but was about to turn back. Blue sparks raced up the end of the bed and shot into the doctor and his daughter. The pair turned back to the bed and saw the nurse's exposed breasts. The doctor stayed professional addressing the nurse calmly as if nothing was unusual.<br>\r\nClaire immediately focused on her father. \"The doctor says they can't find anything wrong with you. Since they can't, you're free to go home at anytime.\" Then she looked stern. A flash of emotional pain hit Mark. Her mother, Shannon had gotten the same look every time he had done something to get hurt. \"However that doesn't mean I'm letting you of the hook. You <i>scared</i> me Dad. I'd thought I'd lost you.\"<br>\r\nMark reached over and squeezed her hand. Out of the corner of his eye he watched the nurse rearrange her clothes and stride briskly out of the room. He understood how Claire felt. He and Shannon had wanted a horde of children. But carrying and giving birth to Claire had taken its toll on her. She'd held on for six years, until one day she just didn't wake up. \"I'll still here Claire.\"<br>\r\n\"I know Dad.\" Claire smiled fiercely. \"So you understand that you are going to sit in your favorite chair while I wait on you hand and foot.\"<br>\r\n\"The doctor chuckled, \"I'd do what the young lady says. She doesn't look like she'll take no for an answer.\"<br>\r\nMark laughed, \"Her mother was the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire drove him home in the Bitch. Apparently Mark's truck had been slightly melted in the lightning storm. Surprisingly the Bitch had worked perfectly afterwards. Mark spent the trip thinking about the blue sparks he had seen. Certainly after being struck by them, people acted differently. Mark was reasonably sure nurse's didn't just flash their patients outside of porn. And if they did that in a room with a doctor watching that was surely grounds for getting fired. <br>\r\nMark's musing were interrupted by Claire opening the passenger side door. \"Dad?\" With a start Mark realized he had been sitting in the driveway for awhile. Claire stood there concerned. \"Are you coming in?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was just lost in thought.\" Mark got out of the car, Claire hovering at his shoulder. \"I'm fine Claire. Really.\"<br>\r\n\"You just got out of the hospital.\" Claire glared at her father, paralleling her mother. \"I don't care what the doctor said. You are not fine. Now get your butt inside.\"<br>\r\nMark chuckled under his breath. \"Yes ma'am.\" Claire herded him into the living room and made sure he was situated in his chair before turning the TV to his one of his favorite channel. Mark took Claire mothering with good humor. Except that Claire absently slid the remote into her sweats before leaving the room. Mark liked to browse a bit before settling on something to watch. And his daughter just stole the remote. Mark waited for Claire to come back with a big glass of lemonade. \"Can I have the remote sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" Claire replied absently before walking out of the room Mark frowned after her. Brat. Then the sparks came back to mind. If he could really control them, then maybe he could use them to get Claire to hand over the remote. Pointing in the direction his daughter went he focused. A bright blue spark leapt from his finger and shot away.<br>\r\nOnly to disappear about a foot away. \"Shoot.\" Mark did in fact make those blue sparks. However he seemed to lack range. Mark saw Claire come the room again carrying his laundry basket. Although he wasn't meant to he caught the worried look on her face. \"Claire, come here please.\" Claire stopped walking but it was a full minute before she set down the laundry basket and walked over. She crouch next to the chair and laid her head on the arm. Mark reached down to stroke her hair. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"You scared me.\" Claire said softly,\"You just went flying through the air. And you weren't moving.\" She sobbed, tears starting to form. On impulse Mark willed sparks into her. He watched as a blue cascade ran over is hand and down his daughters hair. Instantly Claire began to calm. Rocking back on her heels she wiped her eyes. Mark noticed a faint blue glow around the metal link bracelet on her wrist.

Her scrubs, and the blouse she was wearing beneath them, now both had an elliptical cutout that lined up, and if she'd been wearing a bra, it was no longer in evidence. What was revealed was a very nice-looking pair, looking like a firm C-cup, with quarter-size areolae and succulent-looking nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another part of his brain was slightly panicked. Parts of women's clothing didn't just disappear on a whim. This all seemed way too vivid to be a dream -- and would he be feeling this \"fuzzy\" in a dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis confusion must have shown on his face, because Claire interrupted the doctor to ask, \"Dad, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a shirt that had two round cutouts in the appropriate locations such that her freckled breasts and their pale pink nipples were on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gurgled, \"Claire, you -- you -- no --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the fuzz in his head pulse, seeming to briefly expand outward and quickly contract. His vision was blurring, but he thought he saw the cutouts in Claire's shirt disappear, her breasts now covered up. He turned his head back and didn't see any skin tone in the area of the nurse's chest, just the green of the scrubs covering her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Jibs?\" asked the doctor. \"Perhaps we need to do some tests on you ASAP. I'm going to ask you a few questions. First of all, what's your <i>full</i> name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fuzz seemed to be receding. \"Mark Warren Jibs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know where you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a hospital -- I assume whatever was closest to the rest stop on, uh, highway 67. Northside Memorial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor nodded. \"Do you know what time it is now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I was out for 12 hours, right? Uh, about 10 P.M., I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor did a few reflex and other physical tests, but finally seemed to be satisfied with what he'd found, and at last Mark was given something for the pain and instructed to try to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sat down in the chair next to the wall. \"They told me I could stay in here,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, that can't be comfortable,\" Mark said. \"Did your friends all get home all right? Why don't you call one of them -- or if you think it's too late, you can take a taxi home if you need to --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bitch is in the parking garage,\" Claire said. \"It was the only car in the rest stop lot that <i>worked</i> after the lightning. All the others had their electrical systems fried, it looks like. Everyone's home fine. I've got some books on my iPad, I've got money for the vending machines -- <i>I'm staying.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd said that in a tone that meant there'd be no further discussion. Mark had a pang of nostalgia -- Shannon sometimes used exactly the same tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and lay back, listening to the quiet rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor to which he was connected by a sensor on his ring finger. Obviously, Claire couldn't help reminding him of her late mother, with her voice, and -- and the small but perky breasts he'd seen. He was starting to think it was a dream, or at least a hallucination. It was like, just because he'd thought about being able to see the nurse's breasts, suddenly she was wearing clothes that seemed to be <i>designed</i> to leave them uncovered -- and then Claire was as well...</span></div></div>",

He must have appeared shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think --\" His mouth was suddenly dry. \"I need water,\" he croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Claire said. There was a pitcher on the table next to him, which she poured into a plastic cup as he tried to figure out if she was taller -- she definitely <i>seemed</i> taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him the cup, and he sipped.

Peter said, \"I remember that we talked about you using your power, but then you got up and got the water from the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, I've been sitting right here,\" Mark said. \"The water glass just <i>appeared.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>think</i> I believe you, but it's just so hard to discount what I saw -- or what I think I saw,\" said Peter. \"Hmm, try this -- what if you wish that I remembered the old realities anytime you change something? And maybe that it'll put a little summary in my notebook of what's changed. Do that, and then how about a glass of water for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" said Mark, now feeling a bit foolish and wondering if that idea would even work. He brought the fuzz back, and felt a very small piece of it get pushed to Peter.</span></div></div>",

Of course, that should have been obvious from the very first change you made -- one would think that a society in which women's breasts are always on display would be quite different from the one we know, but you didn't see any major changes -- you were still in the same hospital, still with the same nurse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I was kind of out of it,\" Mark pointed out. \"Plus, I wished to see <i>that nurse's</i> breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true,\" said Peter. \"Ahh, your daughter's friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mark moved closer to him to see out the windows. Martha, Tina, and Ling were all in the backyard doing various tasks, along with a couple other attractive girls he didn't recognize -- presumably other members of Claire's cheerleading squad. \"Yes, they're helping me out with yard work, even though I really don't feel like I need it.

He gave her a goodbye as he briefly felt her tits through her T-shirt, then continued down the sidewalk to get in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark saw nothing unusual about this, and merely sat back down on the couch and turned on the TV to the football game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe score, he saw, was a blowout, and a quick scan with the remote showed that this was the only game on. <i>Well,</i> he thought, <i>I've considered upgrading in the past, and it shouldn't affect anybody else, so...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick second with the fuzz in his brain, and suddenly he was holding a different remote control, this one for satellite TV. He quickly found a more competitive game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, just after a last-second field goal had decided the game, he heard footsteps in the kitchen and finally moved his eyes away from the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweaty, dirty Claire stood there. \"We're all done,\" she announced. \"This house might not win any landscaping awards, but at least the front and back yards look presentable for a change. See what can happen when you have seven cheerleaders working for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should invite them in so I can thank them,\" Mark suggested. \"I'm not sure we have a lot of drinks in the fridge, but we can order pizza --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll take a rain check on the pizza party,\" Claire interrupted. \"They're all at least as icky as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea that crossed Mark's mind was that the house had shower big enough for all the girls and that the girls had brought changes of clothes. After the fuzz had cleared, though, he was surprised to see that the living room had grown significantly in size, the furniture upgraded, a grand piano appearing in a newly vacant corner. That gave him a pang -- Shannon had played piano all through her childhood, but without the money and space, she'd only had electronic keyboards to play as an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was distracted by the seven sweaty cheerleaders trooping into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you order the pizza now, Dad?\" asked Claire. \"So it'll get here about the time we're done in the shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" said Mark. \"Do we have a usual order, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked concerned. \"Dad, I'm going to ask you this every time you act like this -- are you <i>sure</i> everything's okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just, uh -- just a few minor gaps,\" Mark answered. \"You don't need to be worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Claire. \"Pizza order for every time the Super Seven are here -- one large veggie, one large pepperoni, and then two extra-large meat lovers' for me and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spencer Syndrome,\" Mark murmured. He'd glanced at a sentence on the Wikipedia page about it requiring a higher caloric intake than a normal human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My phone's still out here, right?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Mark said, looking around as the girls headed down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did find the phone, discovered that he did still remember the number of the local pizza place, and then discovered that the order taker (or the order taker's computer) knew \"the usual\" anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza having been ordered, he started to wander around to look at the changes to the house. It seemed that the rooms were still in their same positions, just bigger. He looked outside to see that the front and back yards were about the same size as before, but the entire lot on which the house sat must have been enlarged somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's bedroom had a canopy bed now, he noticed, and a doorway directly into what had been a bathroom off the hall. That wasn't where the girls were, though -- they were in the master bathroom, past what was now a king-sized bed in the master bedroom. He was curious just how big the shower was, but, of course, he couldn't go in there at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back to the living room and sat back in front of the TV. The football postgame show was on -- it was still about half an hour until the start of the Sunday night game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA commercial for a local car dealer came on, a salesman shaking hands with a smiling man and cupping the ass of his equally happy wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a thought crossed Mark's mind: <i>I</i> could <i>see inside the shower, if there was a camera in there and I was getting a live feed on this TV.</i> Almost simultaneously, he thought, <i>No, that would be wrong!</i></span></div></div>",

He managed to think about different things: How the stupid the ads were and <i>how great it would be to have an analyst going over the score tables again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a large-boobied doll soon appeared on the screen with a billboard-sized screen that displayed the status of the local leagues and how realistic their chances were this season. The analyst used her long pointing stick to review a few of the recent games on a tactic screen, commenting on the strategy used by the players and coaches, and Mark felt awed by her in-depth knowledge of each team. She must do nothing all day but pour through game recordings and statistics, he realized. Well, as long as he and all other spectators could benefit from it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly before the next game started - the interesting one that Mark was eager to watch - the pizza girl ringed at their front door. He quickly took the cartons and stuffed a generous tip into her cleavage, then returned to the TV. He yelled out for the cheer troupe, but they were still in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaanyway, he had a lot of fun when the game started. He wolfed down his extra-large pizza and stole a slice of Claire's, hoping she wouldn't object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the girls emerged from the bathroom, all seven of them bouncing happily refreshed but obviously still tired from the hard workout in the garden. Mark noticed their glowing but clean red cheeks as they sat in the den, clad in oversized fluffy silk bathrobes and pajama trousers. As they settled around the party table and ravished the delivered pizzas, Claire ordered them not to be too noisy so that she and Mark could enjoy the game on their enormous TV screen. The girls complied, and Mark heard them comment on the cheer action in TV, like \"I'm glad we're done for today\" or \"gosh, I'd like to know that move\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark glanced over to the attached side-screen that switched between the two participating cheer squads. He knew they were accomplished gymnasts, like his daughter hopefully would be, but he dismissed their proceedings when the main game demanded his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was eventually over. Mark's favorite team had first lagged behind, but somehow ragained their confidence and clobbered their adverseries in the last few minutes. After a dramatic last minute field goal and a spectacular overtime, his favorites <i>WON</i>, and Mark cheered so happily that all his guests joined him in celebration, jumping up and down on the reinforced hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after the celebration was over, Mark noticed how the hyperactive analyst appeared on screen again, relentlessly hammering her audience with facts after facts. Mark was going to watch the analysis, but Claire reminded him that her team-mates should go home. He hesitantly shut off their home cinema for good. The girls were already dressed in their washed-and-dried clothes again, each of them hugging Claire and getting a long friendly buttcheck from Mark as they said goodbye and filed out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hadn't wanted to comment on their extensive bathroom use, but Claire brought it up when they were both buttering up a few more toasts for their bedtime meals. \"Um, Dad, how did you like our parade in the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... what?\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, Daddybear, I know that you watched us with that expensive 3D camera!\"<br>\r\n\"Errrm, no, dear, I didn't.\" Mark brushed her off. <i>I didn't really install a camera in there?</i><br>\r\n\"Suuuure.\" Claire winked at him. \"Gee, that was a waste of our efforts then. At least <i>I</i> got to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went on automatic as he got ready to bed and laid in his huge eight-poster. He reviewed the day - how he woke up, called the specialist, then watched sports... It was as if little odd things constantly escaped his attention, but he couldn't point his fingers on them. Finally, as if someone had told him not to think too much about it, he drifted into his first dream of the night.</span></div></div>",

When she had half crossed the park she suddenly heard a deafening noise from above. Surprised she looked skyward to see a fiery trail rushing through the black night sky. Shocked she realized it was closing in on her position. The angry wail was becoming louder every second, until it was unbearable. Whimpering Anna covered her ears and buckled down. Like the flaming finger of an angry, acient god the object struck the ground several meters away from her, leaving a massive impact crater. Any obstacle was obliterated in the process. Merciless it tore through the treetops and bursted the treetrunks of the large old Oaks it hit, igniting several branches and leaves, despite the fact that it was still raining. The forceful impact made her teeth clatter and violently shook the ground like an earthquake. Still feeling numbed, not really knowing what she was doing, Anna approached the crater. Half-crouched and fearful she breathed the hot and muggy air, nervously biting her red lips. The rim of the crater emanated an ghostly purple light, obscured by the large pillar of steam rising to the sky from the centre of the crater. The unearthly lights flickered. Despite better knowledge Anna wanted to see the object, which had fallen from the sky. Her instincts seemed to scream at her to turn around and run, but her curiousness got the better of her. Slow but steady she crouched forward. It seemed like an eternity, till she reached the rim of the crater. The purple glow growing more intense every second. Anna held her breath and stepped into the steam. Instantly the steam made her cough and took her sight. She lost her balance and stumbled forward. Head first she fell. An hard impact drove the last air from her lungs, she rolled forward, getting cuts and bruises from the hard, craggy ground. Her slide was ungently stopped by a large dark object, she hit torso first. By now Anna was already near panicked. What had she thought. She could burn here, or suffocate... Wait why she hadn't already suffocated? Why was'nt the steam cooking her? Her fingertips gently brushed the smooth surface of the object. It was smooth and felt like marble. In a second all the pain from her fall was gone. Instead Anna felt an increasing heat. Like pins and needles. And then something diffrent. Comparable from the swelling one feels in his chest, when he takes a really deep breath. But it affected her from the tips of her toes to the top of her head. It was a good, ecstatic feeling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna managed to get back up, the strange feeling growing more and more intense inside her. Before she knew it, she had opened her mouth to breathe again, totally ignoring the pink steam that had been the reason why she had held her breath in the first place. Inhaling it didn't feel bad at all, but rather increased the strange pleasant sensations that had come by touching the black object that had fallen from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird,\" she thought to herself. \"Why am I feeling so good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, her body suddenly jerked, causing her to stop touching the meteor. Rather than diminishing, the felt the feeling becoming even more intense, while at the same time her body moved on its own. The small redheaded woman now stood there in the middle of the crater with her hands spread, unable to move a muscle. But why would she want to do that? By now the feeling had grown so intense, Anna was about to get lost in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart started beating faster, and with each beat, she could feel something happening, she just couldn't figure out what it was. A few more seconds passed and she felt her clothes getting tight. Since they had been soaking wet, they also groaned in protest as they seemed to \u2026 stretch? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna tried to look down her body, yet found that she couldn't move her head and thus barely saw anything, yet in the corner of her eye she could see her blouse stretching against her growing arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening,\" was the first thing that came to her mind. \"Nobody grows that quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she wanted to complain. Anna had always felt too small and thus wished to be bigger, so if for some weird reason her wish would be fulfilled, she would be all for it. And so she smiled as she felt her body getting bigger and bigger. Her small frame growing inch by inch and at the same time, she filled out in all the right places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere before her legs were long, yet stick-like filled out with a slight muscle tone comparable to a runner or gymnast. Her behind filled up to become perfectly round and tight. As her height increased, her blouse could no longer cover her entire belly and so her new abs were exposed to the world \u2013 a six pack that had previously been hidden under a small layer of flab. Anna could feel her bra straps trying to dig into her back and a quick glance down confirmed to that this wasn't just her expanding torso that caused that. Even her breasts were growing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was utterly delighted by every change that she noticed, but quickly figured that there was something off about the whole situation. While she could feel her clothes digging into her skin \u2013 by virtue of being way too small for her \u2013 she didn't feel any pain because of that. She could practically feel that her shoes were about to burst open, so why didn't her feet hurt. As if on cue, she could hear something snap \u2013 her bra strap \u2013 before her entire outfit joined with the sound of ripping clothes. By now she had grown about a foot in height and was obviously bursting out of her clothes, yet she still didn't feel any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only feeling that she felt was the weird pleasant sensation that caused her transformation. It was like her entire body was massaged inside and out, occasionally with the added sensation of the rain hitting her skin. She felt more alive than she had ever before and by now, she clearly looked the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the growth slowing down, and eventually stopping altogether. When it did, she had just passed the 6'5\" mark. Anna could feel another wave of pleasure going through her body and immediately felt herself back in control. She didn't waste any time and quickly explored the changes that had happened to her. And the results were indeed something to behold. Her muscles had grown to the point where she could pass as a fitness model. Not as bulky as a bodybuilder, but Anna was more than ok with that. Looking at her breasts, she wondered if a DD cup would be enough for her, yet somehow they seemed to fit on her body. As she explored her body, she quickly ripped off what had remained of her clothes \u2013 until she was dressed in only her \u2013 ill fitting \u2013 panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod she wished she had a mirror or at least better lighting to look at herself when it hit her: It was still dark, yet for some reason her eyes could see almost perfectly. Also her ripping off her clothes was way easier than she had expected. Could it be that she was stronger than even her improved physique implied?<br>\r\nLooking down at the strange black meteor, she put this theory to the test. Leaning over, she put her hands around it and tried to lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" she said out aloud as she picked it up and slowly held it up above her head. \"This thing probably weights a ton, if not more,\" she whispered to herself. And despite that, it barely felt heavier than the bundle of books she had been carrying earlier. She dropped the meteor which landed on the ground with a dull *thud*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have super strength,\" she said as she looked at her hands in disbelief. \"This is just getting better and better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was, what she was going to do now. In any case, she would need some clothes first - and a shower would be fine too. Too bad that all her clothes were meant for a much smaller woman than she was now, but maybe she could improvise something. Or she could try her friend Kyle, but how would he react to the new, improved and most importantly naked her before even considering lending her clothes?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll be stopping by in a bit and will need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm\u2026 yeah sure,\" there was a pause. \"But why? And are you alright? Your voice sounds a bit strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more than fine actually, but I better explain it when I'm there. You have to see it to believe it. See you in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna hung up with a smile. Kyle may be her best friend and nothing more, yet she still looked forward to see his reaction to the new her. And given that he lived across town, she would need to hurry to get there \"in a minute\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed out of the crater with a new-found determination. If she was super strong, her body should be able to run really quick as well. Once she was out she turned into the direction of Kyle's place and began to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expectations were more than just met. After only three steps she was running more than fifty miles per hour and she wasn't even really trying yet. Once the first buildings were within reach she quickly jumped high enough, landed on the first one and continued her trip by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. This way she avoided being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two minutes later, she had arrived at Kyle's place. When she landed on his balcony, she quickly covered herself with the blanket he had laid out for her before stepping through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had been sitting inside, watching TV when she entered. When he saw her, his jaw dropped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anna?\" he stammered. \"What the \u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna giggled at seeing him at a loss for words. \"Well I had a growth spurt. Could you lend me some clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 I mean sure.\" He was obviously checking her out now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna quickly made her way to the bathroom. Once inside she ditched the blanket and appraised her body in the bathroom mirror. Damn she looked hot! A 6'5 beauty with a fitness model physique and DD cup breasts, not to mention strength and agility that was way beyond human capacities. She smiled. No wonder Kyle had checked her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped into the shower, she pondered her next course of action. Right now Kyle clearly liked her changes, but how would he react once he knew that she could lift several tons now? Would he be scared? Would he like it? Would he help her to deal with this new situation? Maybe it would be better to keep it a secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in defiance. Keeping it a secret was no option, the real question was how he would react once she told him<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the last half hour had changed in the most drastic way anyone could imagine. No, actually nobody would expect this kind of change in reality. But it had happened to her \u2013 and so far she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out, she took the time to admire her new body. At 6'5\", she looked both fit and feminine, combining a fitness model physique with DD cup breasts \u2013 but that was only the tip of the iceberg. She was strong. Really freaking strong. She could lift tons now and had barely felt the weight. Running and jumping from rooftop to rooftop had barely been a warm-up either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the towel to dry herself, she soon noticed that her skin was a lot more sensitive now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, he could use more fabric softener on these,\" she thought aloud as she put on the clothes Kyle had laid out for her. It wasn't much to speak off: a pair of jeans that didn't look too out of place on her despite being cut out for a man and a Superman T-shirt that clearly struggled against her new assets. At least it fit the theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Showtime!\" she whispered to herself as she left the bathroom to face Kyle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Kyle was still excited to see her new appearance, but unlike before he kept his composure \u2013 which made her even more nervous.<br>\r\n\"So\u2026 what happened?\" he asked after an uncomfortable moment of silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a long story,\" Anna began before giving him a quick rundown of what had happened to her. From her almost being hit by a meteor and her subsequent transformation as well as her new abilities that had come with that. During that time, Kyle just stood there and listened with wide eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so I get it straight: A magic meteor gave you super powers?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you put it that way, it sounds ridiculous, but that's what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're super strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna only nodded. Suddenly she felt very self-conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was surprising \u2013 or rather Anna wanted to hit herself for not seeing this one coming. Nobody would believe her claim of being super strong just like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went over to the couch and quickly lifted it up over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\u2026\" now Kyle was awestruck again. It had taken four guys to carry the couch into the apartment, so he knew how heavy it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna took her time in setting it back down. She couldn't believe in how nervous she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool,\" he finally exclaimed and Anna felt like a great weight was lifted off her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can you do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This had left him with a few extra pounds, but he didn't mind - if he felt like it, he could work it off in a weekend, and even then, he didn't feel like it, so what's the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his slacker ways meant he did the bare minimum necessary at work, which left him surprised when...</span></div></div>",

After he'd gotten out of work the morning prior, right at the crack of dawn, one of his buddies from high school, home from college, invited him out to go bar-hopping. He was happy to wander over to the city's nearest bar. Chase's fake ID worked at the first two bars, but around 10 a.m., at the third, the bartender tried to stall him with conversation without giving it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chase saw the police at the front door, he booked it out a side entrance, found a side street, and ran back to his apartment as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of shape, he was exhausted when he finally locked the door behind him and realized he was safe. So exhausted that, still drunk, he fell right asleep. In his uniform. Without setting his alarm. Which meant when he woke up, hungover and sweating, his uniform was way too dirty for work, his head was killing him and he had 15 minutes to get to work, which meant he had to wear the company's backup uniform - one he loathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only extra one they had, and one of the few things Chase cared about was making sure his normal one was always clean. Because this backup one was not fun to wear. Rubber and latex, loose yet tight, bright orange and white, it was uncomfortable and embarrassing. With a scowl, he threw it on and ran to work, both to make it on time and to avoid anyone seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it to the timecards just in time to clock in, only for his pounding hangover to come back with a vengeance. Groaning, the fox begrudgingly (and poorly) did his duties as quickly as possible. When he finished his first rounds, he sat back in his chair behind the desk, ready to doze off. After such a terrible day, he thought, he could just nap through this shift and recover for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he woke up with a gun to his face, and thought to himself \"you have to be kidding me\" as he looked up at...</span></div></div>",

The one directly in front of him was dressed in a black jumpsuit with blue outlines, while the other two were far back enough in the room's doorway that he couldn't quite see many details about them. What he was able to notice was their size, however. Each one had a hulking, massive frame. The one with the gun, a wolf, was easily over 300 pounds, his black and blue suit struggling slightly to contain his size. The others were even bigger, somewhere closer to 400 pounds. He wasn't sure if he was dreaming such a ridiculous sight until the gun-holder started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about Sweet Bee Candy LLC's experimental facility?,\" the wolf barked at him. \"Where's CEO Leonard Sweebee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a beat, Chase said, \"I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm night security. No one has told me anything other than 'watch the cameras' and 'check the machines once a night' since I started 18 months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf, who had just seconds ago looked ready to shoot, suddenly pulled his gun away from Chase's face and turned to his fellow thugs. \"He's an innocent,\" the wolf said. \"Uh... what do we do? We checked the premises and no one else is here, it's just him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick to the plan other than the part where we get Sweebee, then,\" one of the others replied. As he stepped into the room, Chase saw that one of the two thugs may not exactly be a thug. The fat German Shepherd, wearing a full-size blue jumpsuit much like the one the fox was wearing, continued, \"Hey, kid, sorry we put a gun in your face. Wings, get in here.\" Behind the dog walked in a massively fat female hawk, her jumpsuit white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about Sweet Bee, since you've been here so long?\", the German Shepherd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, next to nothing,\" Chase replied. \"I took this job straight out of high school, mostly so I could sleep most shifts and get paid for it. I didn't even know who Leonard Sweebee was until you just said he was the CEO.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Team, a word?\" The three fat furries filed out of the room for a minute, then came back in. \"So... you want the short or long story?\", the German Shepherd continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do the short one,\" Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. So the company you've been working for in the last year and a half? Not exactly all gumdrops and lollipops, despite the fact that it makes those. You probably haven't seen anything since you're only here overnight, but the CEO has spent the last few years developing some... experiments, let's call them. Not a good guy. Not good experiments. We used to work here too,\" the dog said, gesturing to the rest of his team. \"Were you ever offered a tester role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Chase thought. \"Once they asked me if I'd be willing to take on a second role for more money, but once I said no they didn't even explain it,\" the fox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so you have. The three of us were on the assembly line during daytime, so anything for more money sounded good to us. We took it about two years ago, before you started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we were brought into a backroom in the basement,\" the dog continued, \"and they gave us each a special piece of chocolate. They said it was a new recipe they were trying to perfect. After we ate it, we each felt weird, but nothing else happened. They looked really disappointed and fired us on the spot, saying we weren't good fits for the company any more. We were all friends - oh, by the way, names, how rude of me,\" he said, gesturing to the others, \"this is Silence, that's Wings and I'm Arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the names?\", Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to that. So the next morning, we decided to meet up for breakfast at a diner two towns over and try to find new jobs, and that's when things really started getting weird. Breakfast started out normal, but after we each got our first meals, we were still hungry, so we ordered again, ate and split up to send out applications. When we were each on our own, less than an hour later, the hunger kicked back in. For the rest of the day, we ended up eating every hour, and every hour we got hungrier. Eventually, Silence found himself at a local burger shack where he was eating burgers nonstop, while Wings and I ended up at the buffet and couldn't stop eating for hours. The next morning, we were all huge, the size you see before you, but that wasn't it. Silence here realized he was flexible and could move without making any noise. Even though she was huge, Wings' wings worked for the first time ever and she could fly. And I,\" he said, raising Chase's desk in the air without breaking a sweat, \"had super strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's when Sweet Bee came after us. They sent a team of goons to each of our houses. Silence managed to run away, Wings managed to flew away, and I had to beat everyone up,\" Arms said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all finally managed to meet up, where we saw what happened to each other and realized there was something wrong with the chocolate we had all eaten. Turns out Sweet Bee is trying to develop a brainwashing candy that'll make everyone who buys it fat and hungry, addicted to Sweet Bee food. And they messed it up so bad with us that we got superpowers out of the deal. Ever since, we've been fighting crime and trying to stop Sweet Bee from hurting anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sweet Bee hasn't hurt anyone else and I've never heard of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's going to tell the police an evil candy company came after them? Is the news going to put someone on who says three fat people saved them? We're underground. Oh, here's your proof,\" Arms said. He left the room and came back in, carrying a massive box full of thousands of candy bars. \"These are exactly what we had to eat way back when, and we're taking them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to be in huge trouble tomorrow when those disappear,\" Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. We hadn't really thought about that,\" Wings said. \"They're probably going to call the police and have you arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm in trouble with the cops already,\" Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three huddled up again for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we came up with two options,\" they said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You should probably come with us,\" Arms said, picking the box back up effortlessly. \"We're going to get back to our hideout before the alarms sound. We can keep you safe until Sweet Bee stops looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase considered his options. Go with three massively fat apparent superheroes, or likely be arrested for falsely stealing a ton of candy bars? Both options seemed ridiculous, but the former had less prison involved. \"Alright,\" Chase said. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like this kid already,\" Silence said, and the four ran out of the factory and down the road, eventually coming up on an unmarked white van. \"Get in,\" they said, opening the back door and climbing in. Chase followed, since he didn't really have a choice, as the van rumbled to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase was surprised when the van got on the highway, then kept going into the country. For more than an hour they drove, until they came to the nearest mountain with a wooded forest. After another few minutes, they turned onto a dirt path, which turned into pure grass. Finally, the van came to a cave and pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three super furries beckoned Chase to follow them out of the van and through a passage, and to his surprise, they had a makeshift Batcave installed. One wall had a number of computers, with power supplied by generators, while other areas included a training area and a kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our home,\" Arms said, pulling the box of candy bars from the van and putting it in the kitchen area. \"We've got plenty of food for you, some bedrooms off the side, and a rec room if you wanna go watch TV. We're all going to bed, but you're welcome to help yourself to whatever.\" With that, the three left the main room through a side door, leaving Chase all by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind of dumbfounded by the sudden situation he was in, the fox found himself wandering around. He scanned the computers, looked at the training equipment and checked the kitchen before he realized how hungry and tired he was. It had been hours since he'd eaten - it was before he fell asleep, much less before he left with the fatties - and he needed something. \"Help yourself,\" he remembered he was told, and in his sleep-addled confusion...</span></div></div>",

The bars were special in a way, but he couldn't remember why. But his sweet tooth was calling, and other things in the kitchen would take time and effort to finish, so he grabbed three and wandered into the rec room. He turned on the TV, ate the candy quickly, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Wings shook him awake in a frenzy. \"What did you do???\", she exclaimed, and Chase was confused until he looked toward what she was so concerned about. At that moment, he remembered the candy bars were tainted. Just after, he realized how especially hungry he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Arms, Silence and Wings were all concernedly muttering amongst themselves as Chase stayed on the rec room's couch, his appetite slowly growing and crowding out his thoughts of the candy's powers. Every minute that passed, he cared less about the dangers and wanted a bigger meal. A bowl of cereal, a donut and a banana. No, two donuts. No, six, and a muffin. And some eggs. And bacon. Why not a box of cereal, while he was at it? He looked at the three fat furs, still conversing among themselves, and saw none of them were looking at him. With that, he wandered into the kitchen and opened the pantry door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the heroes hadn't been gaining any more weight since their initial transformation, Chase saw they knew how to grocery shop. He grabbed a box of cookies and started chowing down, finishing it in just a minute. From there, it was a box of brownies, a bag of chips, some pasta (which he ate raw). He had just opened the fridge and grabbed a slice of leftover pizza when Wings finally caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween bites, she frantically tried to get him to stop. \"Chase, you\" -chomp- \"need to stop eating\" -chomp- \"so much. You ate more candy bars\" -chomp- \"than any of us, and we're\" -chomp- \"not sure what it's going to\" -chomp- \"do to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grabbed a second slice, Chase laughed. \"Are you kidding me? This is great,\" he said. \"I've always wanted to snack nonstop. Let's just see what happens here. Besides, you did kinda leave me by myself, and this is all technically your fault,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day, Chase's diet became ridiculous. In just two hours, he finished everything in the pantry. Another hour later, as he finished drinking last bottle of soda in storage, the others realized they'd need to keep feeding him. For the rest of the day, Chase's stomach rapidly grew, and fat slowly but surely added itself all over his body. He finally passed out hours later in a food coma, after eating more than a dozen take-out pizzas and three cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, groggy, Chase woke and tried to sit up. Something stopped him. Snapping out of his food obsession, Chase realized he was now...</span></div></div>",
