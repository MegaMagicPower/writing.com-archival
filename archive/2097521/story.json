There was an Irish purple haired lady for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne commercial features her as a volunteer for a magic act where her head is cut off. Another is a tech company add that involves jar heads. The strangest thing of all is that her voice is similar to the one in her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui's head dropped the toast in her mouth as she found a clue to her state.

How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dolly, it's me! Quad2. Got any clues? I'm coming to your house anyways. Just giving you a heads up.\" said the voice until it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta grins, \"That's a friend of mine. He tries to solve this mystery as he found out that it happened to a bunch of people as of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui gulped at the thought of this happening worldwide. She then heard the doorbell rang as Yui rushed to the door carrying Greta's head.<br>\r\nWhen Yui opens the door, she found a man in a trench coat with the only thing visible under his hat is a collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one. Oh great.\" said Quad2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Quad2?\" asked Yui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Looks like Dolly found another head and how are you Greta?\" asked Quad2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I even see that you been on deviant art as of late.\" said Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have some people that will listen to me as it is their interest.\" said Quad2, \"Any progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Bianca is still at it.\" said Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca?\" asked Yui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't know. Our team are just heads that share this body. Each of us specializes in something. Heck, I'll bring you to the team if you like. They have their own special row.\" said Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well meet them. I need more information.\" said Quad2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then end up in the room filled with shelves of disembodied heads. However, they finally met up with a group of heads that look like they are from a spy movie while looking cute and pretty at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst is Jackie, the head you put on when you need some brawn and combat. She is a skilled fighter when attached and even as a head she can handle her own. She is a tan looking head with a dark pony tail and a confidant look. At the moment, she is smoking a cigarette that already lost it's fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is Bianca who is the intelligence of the heads. She has short dark hair and wore a visor like glasses that she uses as a computer that works through voice commands. She often has her hair cut every week as she thinks that it would help her focus and thinks that this is ideal for a head like her. Has some combat experience and is a bit shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is Brenda who is the weapons specialist of the group. She helps forge and build things such as Bianca's devices whenever she gets attached. Although Bianca is a genius, Brenda can build things better, but is not as smart as Bianca. She has long blond curly hair and green eyes. Is considered as strong as Jackie, but it's a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Do we got another mission?\" cheered Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud. I don't have a body so I can't simply leave the room.\" said Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to have visitors here.\" said Brenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta clears her throat, \"Everyone, we have a new team member. She can be our detective as Bianca is not as observant despite her high IQ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not cool.\" said Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet Yui!\" said Greta's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team of heads look at Yui who blushed. Quad2 decides to break it up and get serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your mission is in this folder.\" said Quad2 as he hands it to Yui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come if you want rookie, but you need at least one other head for the mission as an assistance.\" said Quad2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sit on the shelf for now. My last mission left me tired.\" said Greta as Yui places her head on the shelf with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui decides to take one of the heads that is not Greta to her first mission.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In front of a secluded beach in Southern California a battered RV bakes peacefully in the sun, its three occupants snoring loudly and contently in their personal slice of heaven. Unfortunately for them, their morning was about to get much louder and much less peaceful. It all started with the sound of an ancient electronic alarm going off, its shrill shrieks stirring the vehicle/apartment's occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to speak was the one seated with a tattered blanket thrown over him in the driver's seat. Known as Jones he was a relatively tall and lean man in his mid early to mid thirties, though no one knew his exact age. Or his last name. Or if Jones was even his real name. Or why he never shaved the scraggly and uneven patches of black he called a beard. Unwilling to leave his chair just yet, Jones called back \"Kristi! Alarm!\" The alarm continued to beep. \"Kristi! It's your turn to get the alarm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to move from the sleeping bag she resided in Kristi Fields grumbled \"Nuh uh, I got it yesterday! It's totally your turn, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BS, you say that every freaking morning! I got it yesterday, you haven't turned off the alarm in like a year!\" Jones countered angrily, not sure if he actually had turned off the alarm yesterday or not but definitely sure that Kristi didn't do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" A third voice demanded, the short and well curved olive skinned body belonging to said voice rising ominously from the RV's only actual bed like Count Dracula. A half hateful and half asleep glare scanned the room for the source of the damnable beeping. Sighting the alarm amidst a heap of greasy but clean picked Chinese takeout boxes, the dour young woman tossed her blanket aside and stumbled stumbled to her feet, revealing that she'd gone to sleep in her stained, crumpled, and slightly musty Dan's Diner uniform. The name tag she'd not bothered to remove before collapsing into her bed read \"Collie Summer at your service!\" This was in spite of the fact that her name was actually Collie Sumter, though she doubted her boss noticed the mistake or cared enough to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling over to the alarm,nearly tripping over a half dozen curios Jones had scrounged up with his metal detector, magazines Collie had read enough times to memorize, and wrappers for microwave meals that Kristi had been too lazy and to whiny to take down the street to the nearest public trash can, Collie commented \"Jeez, you two are such big babies. It's a wonder either of you can hold down a steady job. OH WAIT! YOU CAN'T!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJones scoffed at the remark, and waved a dismissive hand as he said \"Forgive me, your majesty, for not wanting to involve myself in the soul crushing system of the man that is capitalism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to God if you charged a penny of rent I'd leave you two freeloader hippies to starve so fast...\" Collie muttered. While she technically paid for just about everything the three of them used, including food, water, gas, power, clothes, RV repairs, and about half of their surfing equipment, the RV was Jones', as was the amazing private parking spot right on the beach that he legally owned due to a loophole in California state zoning law (which he inexplicably knew), and he allowed she and Kristi to live there rent free for as long as they chose to, which was coming up on three years for Kristi and was just over four for Collie herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollie turned the alarm off, and was about to make a jab about Jones' general hippie attitude and constant crazed ramblings about the sinister machinations of 'the man', when she noticed something odd out of her peripheral vision. Turning to get a better view she stared at her housemate Kristi's sleeping bag, noting that while her head was poking out the end of it the bag itself seemed... flat. As though there was nothing in it. Walking over to it Collie took hold of the fabric and lifted the sleeping bag off the ground, her eyes widening in shock at the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" She screamed, dropping the empty bag to the grimy floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, what?!\" Kristi asked, looking in annoyed confusion at her horrified friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your body!\" Collie said, pointing below Kristi's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my...\" Kristi stopped, realizing that she couldn't look down. Her neck twitched but her head simply refused to look down. Concentrating, Kristi realized that not only could she not move, but she couldn't even see her body below her relatively small nose. \"What the hell is going on? I can't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the commotion Jones slides out of his chair and turned to the living area. Upon seeing what Collie saw he stumbled back and said simply \"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would someone explain to me what's wrong?!\" Kristi demanded, her friends' horrified expressions rubbing off on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJones and Collie looked at one another, exchanging a wordless expression that ended with both of them nodding. Collie turned back and placed her hands around Kristi's head and lifted her up. Kristi made unintelligible noises as her friend effortlessly moved her, as though she weighed only a couple pounds. Collie then turned her around and carried her into the bathroom area of the RV, showing her the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY BODY!\" Kristi screamed, tears welling up in her eyes. Kristi used to have the athletic body of a twenty five year old professional surfer (what with her BEING a twenty five year old professional surfer, along with both her twenty four and 32-36ish year old housemates), well muscled and darkly tanned with a nice plump butt and small yet perky breasts. Now, however, she had nothing, she was merely a thin faced and dirty blond head being carried by her friend Collie. \"What the hell happened to me? Where the hell is my freaking body? How am I supposed to compete in the Riptide Royale now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't- Wait.\" Collie stopped, turning her friends' head to face her. \"Seriously? You're worried about that surfing competition now? You're a talking severed freaking head and your first concern is a stupid contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING FOR MONTHS!\" Kristi whined \"THE PRIZE WAS $25,000! THE CONTEST IS IN A WEEK AND HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO COMPETE WHEN I DON'T EVEN HAVE A BODY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollie shook her head \"I can't even... Look, just calm down alright? Let's just think about this. You're still alive despite being severed from your body and missing your... basically every vital organ. That means we can assume your body is alive even without your head. All we have to do is find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristi tried to calm herself, breathing more slowly. \"Yeah, yeah you're right. We just need to find my body. After that we can... do something. Find a way to reattach me. Whatever, first things first we have to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJones entered the restroom with the two girls \"Can you feel your body? Maybe if you can feel it we can get a better idea of where<br>\r\nit is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristi closed here eyes, concentrating. \"I... I can feel...</span></div></div>",

What if you run into a bird or a kite or something, I mean falling five feet in the RV is one thing but from a couple stories up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm learning quickly!\"  Kristi said, doing a little loop-the-loop to prove her point.  \"Besides people are less likely to notice me while I'm way up in the air.  On the ground I'll either have to be hidden in one of your backpacks or attract a TON of attention by floating around with you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to attract attention anyway, I mean eventually we're gonna have to ask SOMEONE if they've seen the headless body of a surfer chick stumbling around.\"  Jones says.  \"Assuming your body hasn't been taken back to CIA headquarters for testing or whatever.\"  Before Collie could tell him that he wasn't helping with that last comment Jones said \"Wait, hang on.\"  Jones left the restroom and began rummaging around in one of the RV's closets, emptying out half the contents onto the already cluttered floor before finding... some string and a Halloween face painting set.  \"Kristi, you may have been on to something earlier.  If you're going to be floating way up high above the city we could paint your head up all red or green or whatever and tie some string around you so people will mistake you for a balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a genius!\"  Kristi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're both idiots!\"  Collie countered, scared for her female friend's safety and angry that her male friend was goading her on.

What if you run out of energy or magic or whatever?  Or what if you find your body but can't get back on it?  You couldn't contact us if you did, you'd just be stuck.\"  Collie said, shooting down Jones' flying idea.  \"We'll just have to carry you around with us for now.  Don't worry, we'll get your body back in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever, just hurry up and let's get going!\"  Kristi said, slightly disappointed that she wouldn't get to do more flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A please would be nice.\"  Jones joked, trying to lighten the mood.  Kristi simply glared at him in response.  Pulling a battered old hiking backpack out of the closet and dumping out its contents (among which were expired granola bars, tangled fishing line, a compass that didn't point north, and a first aid kit that had never been opened) Jones motioned for Kristi to hide inside.  Kristi floated herself in and maneuvered so that she was facing up, checking that none of her short dirty blond hair would be caught in the zipper when it was closed.  \"Alright, just sit tight.  If you need to tell us something just whistle, we'll slip off the street and talk in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Kristi said, trying to force an optimistic smiled onto her face in spite of everything.  Without another word Jones zipped up the backpack and Kristi was plunged into almost total darkness, the thick rain resistant padding of the camping bag stopping nearly all light from passing through.  Kristi felt herself being lifted up then shaken as the backpack is thrown over Jones' shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where should we look first?\"  Collie asked, her voice muffled and distant through the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...we should start at the beach and work our way into the city from there.  If we overhear anyone talking about a headless surfer chick stumbling around we'll ask where they saw it but otherwise we should keep our mouths shut about our friend's 'condition'.  Wouldn't want to start a panic.  Or draw too much attention to ourselves, even if it ain't the Fed behind this then they'd probably pull us in for questioning and throw Kristi in a lab forever.\"  Jones said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Collie wanted to argue against Jones' usual brand of paranoia she had to admit he had a point for once.  \"Alright, let's get looking.\"  With that she and Jones stepped out of the RV and began combing the beach.  Being early in the morning on a weekday there weren't a whole lot of people around, and eavesdropping in on a few of their conversations none seemed to be talking about a headless body running around.  After an hour of walking along the sand Collie and Jones made their way into the city proper.  Another hour passed and still nothing, not one person had sighted Kristi's body or if they had they weren't talking about it publicly.  After a while Jones and Collie snuck into a unisex supermarket bathroom to discuss things with Kristi.  \"Shit, nothing.\"  Collie said. \"You'd think that if a headless lady were walking around a highly populated area SOMEONE would have seen it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming her body hasn't been taken in for experimentation.\"  Jones muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT.  HELPING.\"  Kristi said angrily.  \"Look, maybe we need to change up our tactics.  We're getting nowhere fast by searching on foot like this.  Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kristi could finish her thought the three friends heard something from the other side of the bathroom door.  Screaming.  Running to the door Jones cracked it open enough for all three friends to see out.  What had caused the screaming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are met with screams as they scramble away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some dude's head just fell out of the sky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head just talked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to all the things people yell across the street in panic. Someone running accidentally runs into you, sending you up in the air again, before landing and rolling down a hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop!\" you try calling out \"I lost my body and could use some help\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop upon rolling up to a storefront. You sigh as everyone is scared of a bodiless head.<br>\r\nFinally, someone comes up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is...</span></div></div>",

You try to move, but part of you is petrified with fear and the other part can't wait to see what happens. Her speed picks up as she holds the sword up, readying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one large swing, you feel the cold blade start to cut through your neck.

In the corner of your eye you see the dullahan woman standing with her back to the window. She appeared to be undressing. With her focus off the window, now was a good of time as any, Luckily it isn't locked as you raise it open quietly. You climb through and immediately take cover behind a table. Your vision hadn't moved despite your head having moved, so you could see above the table with your neck stump still hidden. She was still focused on removing her clothes as you try not to look. You sneak your way over to your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you extend your arms to pick it up, you hear a loud stomp. You turn to see the naked headless woman standing over you with hands on hips. She looked angry that you'd steal what must now be her head. You back away slightly from her. She then seems to act like she is laughing. Picking up a small notepad and pen off a table she begins to write. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I figured you'd come after your head. Most people like keeping it on\" she writes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just feel I could use it. I like being headless\" you type out on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? No one before has ever been happy about it. That might mean you'll choose differently\" she replies on paper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choose differently? What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always give people I behead a choice if they come after their head, which they all have. You can take your head and leave, or stay with me here and we get rid of that silly head\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised at her offer. You got a sense of loneliness from her as she awaited your response. You look at your head then back to her. Making the choice...</span></div></div>",

He works 8:30 to 5:00 at a boring but well paying office job, he has two beautiful children he loves dearly, he is a little out of shape but does enough jogging to keep himself chubby rather than fat, and right up until this morning he thought he had a pretty stable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat notion was proven false at exactly 7:00am one Wednesday morning, when the buzzing of Tyler's alarm clock roused him from a very deep sleep and a very strange dream.  He dreamed that after a particularly lovely dinner of capers and milk, his kids had hugged so hard that his head had popped off and floated away from his body like a balloon, into a sea of clouds made of diamonds.  Normally Tyler's dreams were just random colors and the occasional face, so dreaming of something so tangible in and of itself was an oddity, an oddity which compounded with the strange subject matter of the dream.  Tyler was about to roll over and tell his partner about the strangeness of his dream, when he realized that he couldn't.  Tyler couldn't move any part of his body.  In fact, he couldn't feel any part of his body.  Everything below his neck was completely numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes snapping open, Tyler quickly noticed something unnerving about his position.  His head was at an impossible angle, his chin resting flat against his pillow, as though his neck and body were embedded inside the bed.  \"What the fuuu!\"  Tyler yelped as his world suddenly lurched and spun in a blur of colors.  He hit his carpeted floor hard, his face and messy bedhead grinding across the floor as he rolled across the room.  He came to a stop when his scalp bumped into his dresser, facing the bedroom's standing mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\"  Tyler squealed, his horrified face reflected perfectly in the mirror.  He was just a severed head, his body nowhere to be seen!  \"OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!\"  He repeated, unable to accept what he saw.  How was this happening?  How was he alive?  How was he talking without a body?  Where was his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler heard his door open, his panicked screams attracting one of his family members.  It was...</span></div></div>",

No one else can hear him or her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead and body need to be together to stay alive as the body provide movement and the head is used for communication, senses, and eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo prior boyfriends or girlfriends. I'm just sick of this with protagonist that already have one. Trying to have a new change of pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe character has to earn the love relationship and it needs to be develop. Have a few chapters(About 7-10) of them building it until it's official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesent grammar would be nice and make the chapters descent at least. Not too short like one sentence or a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStay in character. Try to understand what is going on before adding the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone breaking these rules would have me either editing the chapter or deleting it. I won't be rough unless it's a major problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust enjoy yourself. I do not like being pushy, but only when I have to. Write whatever you want and don't be afraid.
