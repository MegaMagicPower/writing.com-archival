Finished looking at his reflection he entered the shower to bathe.<br>\r\nExiting the shower he got dressed and made his way to the kitchen of his house, to cook breakfast. <br>\r\nOnly to be interrupted by his television showcasing an Alert to the citizens of Las Vegas, approaching the television he turned up the volume to hear the newswoman speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Beverley Clang, reporting to you live from the Vegas strip. Which approximately twenty minutes ago was assaulted by an unknown source. As you can see behind me firefighters are attempting to put out the fire encasing multiple buildings that line the strip. <br>\r\nAt this moment 32 deaths have been confirmed. On top of dozens of wounded people, covered  with third degree burns who have been rushed to hospitals for immediate care.The source responsible for this destruction is still unknown.  <br>\r\nWitnesses of the attack claim the one responsible wasn't human, one witness who claims to have got a good look at the creature says it had a metal body with electricity covering It head to toe. These claims however  police say are unverified and likely untrue.<br>\r\nWe'll continue to update you to the situation as soon as more information becomes available. <br>\r\nUntil then we'll return you to your regular broadcasting already in progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuting the television Thomas, sat down on the couch that was positioned in front of the Tv to take in what he had just seen and heard.<br>\r\nA few minutes later he rose to his feet, headed into his basement, and removed the dark blue body suit and hover board from the closet he stored them in.<br>\r\nHaving put on the full body suit that consisted of boots, leggings, body jacket, gloves, and a mask he grabbed the hover board and existed his two story house, activated/mounted the board, and headed to the Vegas strip, to investigate. </span></div></div>",

Thankfully my bodysuit absorbed most of the damage. I wonder what the hell that thing was. Whatever it is it's no pushover. What did it call itself? Syphon? Yeah that's it.\"<br>\r\nTyping into the computer Midnight, entered Syphon, into the blank page and begun to jot down all that he's learned about him so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on what I know so far it's got at least some intelligence, is immensely strong, and apparently can control and redirect the electricity in it's body. He's at least 7 feet tall, covered in a silver metal like body casing, and is equipped with a long metal blade in his right arm.<br>\r\nAfter electrocuting me it seemed to have lost energy. Which means it must run on electricity. Which would explain why the electric box at the casino was unharmed and why there was no electricity in the area. He absorbed the electricity being pumped into the building so he could charge his power cells. He must need electricity to function. If that's the case then he'll need to feed again and continue to do so often.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished typing, Midnight, leaned back in his chair thinking to himself.<br>\r\n\"If Syphon, needs to feed on electricity to function, he must be a robot of some sort, but who built him and why?  Perhaps i can get him to tell me, as soon as i find him again. He's in need of fuel so he has to feed soon. But when and where? Is the question.  Guess I'll have to explore the city until I find him\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the chair he picked up his mask and put it back on as he walked up the stairs. <br>\r\nExiting the basement he walked into his living room and saw the tv that he left on earlier had another alert on it. <br>\r\nGrabbing the remote he unmuted the tv and listened to the reporter say.<br>\r\n\"This is Beverly Clang, reporting to you live from downtown Las Vegas, where just moments ago police entered a standoff with a robotic like creature. The robotic like creature has reportedly killed several officers and shows no sign in surrendering.  The entire area has been blocked off, and at this moment we're unable to see what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting any time he rushed out of his house, mounted his board, and flew to downtown Las Vegas. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I suggest you stop shooting, and get everyone out of the area.\"<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?\" Shouted back one of the cops.<br>\r\n\"The name is Midnight, and I'm here to take that monstrosity down.\"<br>\r\n\"Just how do you propose on doing that?\" <br>\r\n\"Look I don't have time to explain things to you, that thing is going to the power station to absorb the electricity from it. I have to stop him before he gets that far, now go get everyone out of the area and leave him to me.\" <br>\r\nObeying the masked man, the officer shouted  \"You heard the man let's go.\" <br>\r\nAs the officers fled Midnight, raced after Syphon, catching up to him, he jumped off his board and tackled him to the ground. <br>\r\n\"Enough\" Said Midnight, as he struggled to hold Syphon, down. <br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Replied Syphon, as he smacked the back of his head against Midnight's, face. <br>\r\nTumbling backwards onto his ass from the blow he just received, he quickly got up and saw Syphon, rising to his feet. <br>\r\n\"You got lucky earlier, but this time you're not going to survive.\" Snarled Syphon. <br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure about that.\" Replied midnight. <br>\r\nBringing his hands to his side Syphon, retracted both his hands replacing them with long metal blades as he yelled \"Prepare to die!\" <br>\r\nRecoiling Midnight, prepared to defend himself. <br>\r\nSyphon, began swinging both hands in a swiping motion in an attempt to hit his opponent. <br>\r\nWhile dodging the attacks Midnight, countered by blocking Syphon's right hand as it swung toward him with his own right hand, followed by delivering a kick to his abdomen sending Syphon, to the ground.  <br>\r\nQuickly getting up Syphon, jumped 10ft into the air in an attempt to stab Midnight, from above. <br>\r\nManaging to doge Syphon's right hang blade that came down toward his head and pierced threw the road, Midnight, braced himself for the next attack.<br>\r\nForcefully pulling out his blade that was embedded in the road, Syphon, began to walk toward Midnight, only to begin stumbling. <br>\r\n\"Damn it! I'm almost out of energy, I need more.\" Muttered Syphon, to himself. <br>\r\nSeeing that Syphon, was barely able to move Midnight, went in for the attack upper cutting Syphon, sending him flying up in the air and crashing down to the ground a few seconds later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching Syphon, who was laying face up on the ground, Midnight, slammed his right foot down on his chest.<br>\r\n\"It's over you're finished.\" <br>\r\nStealthily moving his right hand Syphon, managed to stab Midnight, in the leg. <br>\r\nPulling back his leg and falling to the ground, Midnight, grabbed his injured leg with both hands letting out slight moans of pain. <br>\r\nRising to his feet Syphon, replied \"I'm far from being finished.\" and began to slowly make his way to the power plant to feed. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
