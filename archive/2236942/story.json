A select few are assimilated into a gems...well, gem, making them much more durable, long lasting pets that their goddess can bring back after death. Sometimes this is worse for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-A assimilated human can always be brought back, some gems use this as an excuse to play with them in...creative ways. They can also inherit some gem abilities (EG-fusion. A human absorbed by a Jasper will slowly get stronger, the marks on a Jasper's skin appearing on theres and gaining an orange tint etc). Gems can also alter the human with Shapeshifting post absorption, making them smaller or larger or even changing there appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2- you can have the human be treated in *any* way by their Gem. Although Cruel is prefered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3- As you may of noticed, we are 18 plus here. However we do have limits. No Farts, scat, piss, male giants or Futa please.</td>",
