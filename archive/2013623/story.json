This is not a perfect system and will probably lead to some overlap (For example, although she has been in a few movies, Kat Dennings is largely known for starring in 2 Broke Girls, so she'll be listed under the TV section), but it's the best I can do, so kindly bear with me. To make things easier, I'll be sure to put the celebrity's name in the title of later chapters where choice branches become limited, so browsing from the story outline won't be a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy choosing, you sick control freaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Also, pics for reference on what a celeb looks like are on you to find. New tabs and Google are your friends here.)</span></div></div>",

Pleasure to meet you! Thank you for the kind words!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma Watson entering your apartment. It was a dream come true. It did occur under some rather strange circumstances, but then again, it takes a very strange set of circumstances indeed for the famous young actress to show up at an average man's door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had not been long after Watson had made her speech to the United Nations on the topic of feminism and the organization's newly created HeForShe campaign for gender equality. With the speech drawing both praise and criticism in substantial amounts, you decided to add your voice to the discussion. Watson being the refined British lass that she is, you decided to dust off your old fashioned penmanship skills and send her a hand-written letter expressing your support for and agreement with the views expressed in her speech. Rather boldly, you ended your letter with an invitation for her to meet you at your apartment in order to discuss relevant issues relating to the movement in greater depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for that boldness was not so innocent, however; You had always had a penchant for concocting strange chemical mixtures in your spare time, the kind of experiments even the most daring of professional chemists wouldn't touch. One evening, through a combination of chemicals you obtained not entirely legally (Hey, all's fair in love and science, right?), you wound up creating a stable mixture with a light pink hue, pheremone-like qualities, and a rather pleasant, fruity smell. Upon further testing (i.e. spraying around the complex wherever you could sneak it in), you found that the mixture's sole effect was to induce a strange reaction in human females, causing them to behave in a more traditionally feminine way than normal. For instance, the rather standoffish woman who lived a floor below you started acting much more open and demure in the days after you initiated testing, while your female landlord, who was normally quite tight-fisted, was suddenly much more patient with you, and had developed a sudden interest in baking that fortunately meant several offers of free, freshly baked sugar cookies. It was truly a scientific miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to your other, more exciting (read: more explosive) creations, this new concoction was rather mundane, and you didn't intend to use the compound for much more than personal amusement and enrichment. That all changed, however, when you saw a news report on Ms. Watson's speech. Having always been rather mischievous and a fan of black comedy, you couldn't resist the urge to attempt to turn the woman who had now become one of the most visible feminist figures in the world into someone a bit more... domesticated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowsing the letter in copious amounts of the chemical (Luckily, the stationary was already a similar shade of pink), you stuffed it into an envelope and delivered it to her address (which took a bit of personal sleuthing to uncover. You were certainly known for going to great lengths merely for the sake of a joke.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you knew in the back of your mind it was a pretty big lark. The address might have been bunk. It might have gotten lost in the mail. A mail carrier or one of Watson's handlers might have thought in was from some crazy who laced the letter with cyanide, even though you did your best to make it look harmless. It was all a shot in the dark, really. As much work as you put into your practical jokes, you never gave them much thought after the deed was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why you lit up when you not only found a personalized return letter from Watson in your mailbox, but saw that the letter gave a specific date and time for when Ms. Watson would come to visit incognito (She specifically stressed that this was in fact a private meeting, not a PR stunt. What a relief.) The chemical worked: Emma Watson had been compelled into acquiescing to your rather silly demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the date in question, you brewed a new batch of the compound as fast as you could and practically coated your apartment in what remained of the first batch. Oddly enough, it made the place smell quite a bit nicer than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around mid-afternoon when Ms. Watson made her entrance. While well-disguised in sunglasses and a hooded coat, she removed her coverings to reveal an exquisite pink dress underneath. Wowed by her wonderfully feminine presence, you were quick to invite her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope the flight wasn't too much trouble! Thank you again for your visit! I feel so blessed to be given this chance to speak with you!\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing at all!\" she said brightly, \"I'm quite busy though, so I must ask, what did you have in mind to discuss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually had a rather clever idea.\" you said, \"You made it a point in your speech that current gender roles were too stifling for both men and women. What if, as a little thought experiment, we acted out those gender roles for a little bit? You know, to point out their patent ridiculousness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the strongest hook, but the air was thick with the chemical, and Watson's body language was only becoming more compliant and accommodating. \"That sounds brilliant!\" she said eagerly, \"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

What better way to force Emma to act like your idea of a typical woman than have her clean your entire apartment. Maybe even in that outfit\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmma, I'd like you to look around my place. No need to move, just look with your eyes,\u201d You tell her, gesturing to the messy room behind you. Her eyes scan the room before returning to you. \u201cWell, what do you think of it? Be totally honest I can take it\u201d. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is rather messy. Being totally honest, it's a bit disgusting,\u201d She said, her eyes locked onto yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then. I think that the first gender assumption will be to have you clean the entire apartment. No empty cans, no pizza boxes, no clothes in the bedroom\u2026 You get me?\u201d<br>\r\nThe young woman nodded. She looked eager to start, you noted with a smile. This newest formula was working amazingly! <br>\r\n\u201cBefore you start, however, I have a small request,\u201d You say to her. \u201cI'd like you to wear a specific outfit. Allow me to go get it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading for your room, you quickly grab a brand new maid's outfit. You grinned at the low neckline and short skirt. This would be perfect for shoving Emma into the role of what she was fighting against. <br>\r\nBefore leaving, you spray a little more of the compound on the uniform, in case the mass amount you had sprayed around the apartment wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to Emma, who was busy looking around in the kitchen, you present the uniform to her with a rather mischievous \u201cTa-Da!\u201d<br>\r\nWatching her face, you grin inwardly as she smiles at the uniform. <br>\r\n\u201cThat would be perfect for cleaning in! Thank you so much for thinking of it!\u201dShe says brightly, taking the black and white dress from your hands \u201cAllow me to go change\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving for a minute, Emma returns in the dress. Not only did she suit it, it made her look\u2026 Beautiful? Gorgeous? You smile as she pulls her brown hair up, tying it into a ponytail. <br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asks, twirling around. <br>\r\n\u201cYou look amazing, Emma. Now, to work, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her a duster, a bin bag and a spray bottle, you decide to act out your own role by\u2026  </span></div></div>",

Publicity can be a rather mixed one, however, and when that publicity leads to you being targeted by online hackers ready to leak your most private moments to the horny world at large... well, even the toughest competitor in The Hunger Games could be forgiven for cracking under the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been an easy few months for Jennifer Lawrence, having been one of the most prominent victims of an enormous celebrity photo leak (nicknamed, quite crudely, as \"The Fappening\") that saw countless photos of her tight, athletic body posing in the cutest, most revealing outfits and underwear that blockbuster franchise money could buy (that is, when she was posing in anything at all.) Already feeling pressured to deliver another crowd pleasing turn as lionhearted heroine Katniss Everdeen in the latest installment of the Hunger Games franchise, the humiliation of being thrust into the media spotlight in the most degrading of ways left her quite visibly shaken while on the set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think it really affected you at first. After all, you were just a bit player intern on the set of the latest Hunger Games movie. Sure, landing an internship at such a popular film project sounded like the breakthrough of a lifetime on paper, but in reality you weren't so much the bottom of the totem pole as the dirt beneath it. You did whatever inglorious odd job they demanded of you, and the most interaction you ever got with the exciting young stars of the franchise was handing off coffee to them in a hurry. Still, what few encounters you had with JLaw (as she was so affectionately nicknamed) were enough to see how unhappy this whole mess was making her feel, and you couldn't help but feel like you had to do something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring another routine coffee run for JLaw, you nervously mentioned that you dabbled in hypnotherapy in your spare time, and suggested that it might help her relax and relieve some pressure. It was little more than a minor ice breaker, so you were surprised when she was actually willing to give it an exasperated try (\"Why not? Don't really have time to book a real hypnotist session anyway.\") Obviously, you were not about to pass up some one on one time with one of the hottest new actresses in Hollywood, which is how you found yourself nervously fiddling with a coin inside her private trailer during a quick 15 minute break on set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay... Uh, I'm not really sure how to swing this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I sure hope so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young blonde gave an impatient sigh. She had obviously treated this as a bit of a joke, and was quickly growing bored with it. Not wanting to look like a complete idiot in front of someone who could make your young career, you desperately thrust the coin in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some miracle, some light peering through the trailer window hit the coin at just the right angle, lighting it up with a brilliant glow. It only took a split second of staring at the luminescence before JLaw's hardened gaze suddenly relaxed into a sort of neutral daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... It's really pretty...\" She mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:Really? I mean it's kind of ol-\" you cut yourself off quickly, realizing in time that you were about to miss your cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yes! It's r-really pretty, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Shiny...\" She said, her voice trailing off into even more of an airy whisper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like the light it gives?\" you said with more confidence, realizing that it was actually working (First time ever!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes you feel good, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes....\" Her voice was barely audible at this point, and her eyes were completely glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to keep the good feeling, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. The gorgeous young starlet simply sat in an entranced stupor. You couldn't believe it; one of the most famous women in the world was completely helpless in your power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you feel the good feeling, all your other bad feelings will go away. You will feel free... no stress at all, no pressure. Only the good feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer luscious lips curled slowly into a dopey smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to keep this good feeling, you must do what the coin says. The coin is your master. I master the coin. Therefore, I am your master. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words coming out of the mouth of the woman you were once a lowly coffee slave to. It was too perfect. Still, break was almost up, so it was finally time to give some quick instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were certainly going to do something alright... You were going to take that firm defiance and strength she showed in the face of public embarrassment and turn it on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like the harmless coffee boy had more of a prankster streak in him than anyone expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see here...\" you thought evilly to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You have psychic powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power to control the mind of people who's mind are weak. Sure it sound silly but you found out about this power this morning going around the con alone again. You never had many friends who liked what you like so as always you went solo on you con adventure, yet this time instead of it being an experience of fighting for places to see the latest comic or having to queue for hours eventing seem to go your way. Standing in a long line too long? You<br>\r\nsimply complain and sudden the entire line moves aside as if your the king. Voice actor not willing to say the line you like? You complain to them and suddenly there doing it before asking you if you need anything else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought this was all a trick or something by the staff of the con as your were a regular. Yet what finally nailed you belief that you indeed wield some mystical power is around some booth babes. You complain to yourself that you've never get to touch one of these girl and suddenly one rather busty babe grabs your right arm with a grin on her face, takes you around the back of her booth and begins to allow you to grope her all the while encouraging you by telling you how string your hand felt and how your touch made her want more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proved it and with this new found knowledge you made your plan to have Megan Fox  as your own. You knew she was coming to the con everyone did but now you could something no other fan could. You think the plan through in your head again and again as the queue becomes shorter, first get to the table where Megan is signing. Then complain about not having such a wonder person as her not being at your beck and call all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this works, I swear best comic con ever.\" You think to yourself happily as finally you get your chance. Sitting down and looking rather bored out her skull Megan welcome you with a big smile and cheerful \"Hi there and what can I sign for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you mange to give her your copy of the teenage mutant ninja turtle before quietly complaining causing  Megan to say \"Sorry did you say something?\" You shake you head and quickly thank her before racing off. Nothing seem to happen even standing around for a few minutes waiting Megan still sat there signing shirts, dvds and talking to fan like normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dam it what did I do wrong?\" You thought to yourself rather angry at your failure. You decided enough was enough and left the con to return to your hotel room for a bit to time to yourself. Your powers managed to get you the best dinner the hotel could offer for free including a pot of fresh strawberries and cream. You sit on your hotel bed sadly with nothing but the sound of the busy streets below you as you wonder what went wrong with your powers as the time slowly goes by until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Your heart is thumping almost painfully in your chest as you watch her. She is watching you now as she slips her fingers into the waistband of her panties and slowly slides them down her hips. You watch them as they slide down her shapely legs and puddle on the floor at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling now, she bends over slightly to reach into the shower.

They sound mad and the knocking is getting louder....But Megan Fox is also standing in your shower, waiting for you to join her and massage her glistening, wet, naked body. </span></div></div>",

It left many fan feeling sorry for her with some sending her chocolates, cards and flowers to hep with the healing however you wanted to do more for your favourite actress, she needed to be around someone during this time and who better then you her number one fan? Well the question is how would you an average joe get such a Hollywood hottie to spend time with you? Body spray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes thanks to your time in chemistry in university and plenty of free time like all students, one night you manage to create a body spray that messes with the human hormones. At university your magic spray was only a prototype you used to pull jokes on your fellow students but now with your own flat and a few more years of tweaking you have finely tuned the spray into a real piece of science. So after a few test run with a few local women resulting in some interesting results such as you now having a free maid to clean your flat and a life time of free fast food from a local joint its time to push the spray to the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending a simple bunch of flowers and a small card to Kaley Cuoco covered with your spray, you wait about two weeks going to work and dealing with every day thing until finally one early morning your door bell rings making you sleepily slumber over to the door ready to shout at whoever though waking you up at this hour is funny. You slowly open the door and there standing in a coat with the hood up is Kaley with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your name. I got your note and flower you mind if I come in?\" she asks kindly making you quickly invite her in. It was only when she came in that you noticed Kaley had her legs on show and that's when she took off her coat you saw she wearing the red dress she went to the golden globes in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just come from a party?\" You ask making her nod answering she did explaining one of her staff brought her your gift and at once she just felt compelled to come spend some time with her number one fan. Hearing you couldn't help but feel giggly that one of the hottest women in the word is in your flat though you did ask Kaley if anyone came with her making her laugh saying she wouldn't want anyone to get between them this instantly set your head ablaze. Now the idea where coming fast and furious of what you could do with your guest and the time to choose to come.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink to image Kaley wearing the dress!<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://k60.kn3.net/taringa/C/4/7/D/E/7/ulyssesdc/B1D.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://k60.kn3.net/taringa/C/4/7/D/E/7/...</a>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl as if irritated, but your sister can hear the laughter in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're the best boy grip on the <i><b>Ghost Whisperer</b></i>, now starting filming its second season. It's a job that the men in your family have been doing since the movie industry started up at the beginning of the last century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you're doing the job a little differently than the men in your family before you have done it. For one thing, you have a dual degree in physics and electrical engineering. You also have five patents in your name that subsidize your salary quite nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you have  one unpatented invention that comes into play in your current job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not a bad looking guy, and  the fact that you're in your late twenties, have a job in the entertainment industry and make good money, means you never have to worry about getting a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't want to just date someone. You want to be with one of the starlets you work around all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, you want to be with Jennifer Love Hewitt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you saw her in <i><b>Can't Hardly Wait</b></i> seven years ago, you fantasize about her all the time. And when you found yourself on the production crew of her new TV show, it was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were no closer to Hewitt than you when you watched her on the big screen, but now you had a plan and a secret weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your position as best boy for lighting, you introduced your unpatented device into the lighting on the set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make everyone instantly obey you. But it reinforced all your good qualities. You're known as the affable guy who's good at your job but isn't an asshole about, who doesn't get involved in the drama at work, doesn't date co-workers, but is willing to lend a sympathetic ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven some of the actors get to know you, at least well enough to give you a nod and use your name when they see you in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Jennifer, of course, but you had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a coffee shop on your way to work, called The Nut Hatch, that was one of those hole in the wall places everyone knew about. So every morning, you bought a cup for yourself and your immediate supervisor. In a couple of months, you were bringing in a tray for a number of people, usually dropping them off before you went to your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, you brought in a tray when Hewitt was talking with one of the producers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wish I knew someone was going the Nut Hatch,\" she remarked. \"I love that place. But the paparazzi are always thick around that place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take mine,\" you tell her, handing her your cup. As luck and careful planning would have it, you drink your coffee the same way Hewitt does. She gives you a smile as you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there on out, you drop a cup at her trailer every morning you go to the Hatch. For the first month, you give it to her assistant (whom you offer to get a cup for as well, but fortunately doesn't like coffee). You don't wait around for Hewitt to get her coffee. You're projecting the image of the nice guy doing something to keep the star of the show happy before getting to his real job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a month, Jennifer makes a point to come out her trailer and thank you. After a couple of weeks, she invites you to stop by her trailer at the end of the day for a cup of the set's coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a point to not say anything inappropriate or let your eyes linger anywhere too long. You give off the impression of a guy who doesn't need to be told that he needs to stay in the friend zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more weeks, Jennifer is laughing and touching you all the time. You smile but don't get touchy feely in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have to. The device is doing its job. You just have to wait until Jennifer is in a position in her life where she can date you. Then you just need to get her back to your place, where the altered lighting will further reinforce the instructions the lighting at work is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filming for the season ends, and Jennifer gives you a hug, telling you that she hopes to see you when filming for season two begins. You're a little disappointed that Jessica's social life is such that her subconscious doesn't suggest she ask you out, but you're patient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen filming for season two begins, Jennifer makes a point of searching you out. Because you didn't push the programming (or yourself on her), Jennifer still has a positive outlook toward you. The gossip column says she's available, so maybe this is the year you get her back to your place and give her the enhanced programming through your home lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the directions for episode two of the second season are posted, and you see who the featured guest star is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacey Chabert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, she's what made the movie <i><b>Mean Girls</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea comes to you. What if you could get Chabert and Hewitt back to your place together. Put them through enhanced programming together, Have them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you do something that might be stupid, but you make an adjustment to the programming device in the lighting, to get Lacey more inclined to like you, and to get both women not to be jealous of the other over you, and end up cancelling the programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, you don't get caught, and it works. Jennifer now thinks of you as one of her BFFs, and subconsciously considers you as a possibility for more. Lacey thinks of you as a nice guy, and subconsciously wishes she could find someone like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Lacey enjoy their time working together, and at the end of the week, you spend time with Jennifer and Lacey in Jennifer's trailer. Jennifer and Lacey don't want their reunion to end quite yet, and suggest a homemade meal, with you invited, at<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She places a hand on your forearm as you refill her wine glass, giving it a little caress as she does so. \"Anyway, I wanted to see if you were as good at cooking as you seem to be at everything else at work. You do not disappoint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live for such compliments from your lips,\" you say with a little bow, which makes the two young women giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything has been going perfect since Jennifer and Lacey have arrived at your beachfront condo. Lacey seemed impressed that someone on the lower end of the rolling credits (not how she put it) had such a nice place. Jennifer explains you have five patents to your credit. No, you didn't brag to Jennifer about it. It came up in casual conversation. But your special lighting must be doing its job, since she remembered that fact, and is using it brag on you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls laugh at the sight of the hot tub on your deck, with Lacey calling it classic Hollywood kitsch. You laugh with them, but add that as much as you would like to say it was for \"recreational purposes,\" you actually got it after working on a particularly grueling movie production. This leads to a discussion of everybody's past projects as you settle the ladies into your living room, pour them a glass of wine each, and begin making dinner. Jennifer and Lacey, both dressed comfortably in sweatshirts with \"Party of Five\" on them, as well as loose jeans and sandals, seem very relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe programming of the lighting, combined with the wine and the relaxed atmosphere, is doing its job. Any time one of the ladies walks into the kitchen to see how things are going, she makes it point to give you a lingering touch. Equally exciting to you is that Lacey and Jennifer are being very touchy-feely with you. You're refraining, of course. Not that you don't want to be touchy feely. It's just that when it's time to \"cross the line,\" you want Lacey and/or Jennifer to do it, so that you know your programming is working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupper is light (pasta with a lemon and butter sauce, grilled vegetables and plenty of wine), so everyone feels content but not full. You don't do anything to the wine or food. Your expertise isn't biochemistry, after all. But the lighting seems to be doing the trick. Jennifer and Lacey are staring at you (and each other) with thinly veiled desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to gather the dishes, Jennifer stands up and says, \"I think the chef deserves a reward,\" and wraps her arms around you. Lacey chimes in, \"Group hug!\" which makes you and Jennifer laugh as you both stretch an arm for her to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug isn't a brief one, but extends beyond a point that most people would find uncomfortable. You are enjoying having Jennifer's and Lacey's firm soft bodies pressed against you, and they seem to be enjoying the experience as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comfortable silence ends when</span></div></div>",

Striking good looks, countless music awards, many millions of dollars in record sales... and such a checkered love life that it became constant fodder for tabloid gossip and cheap late night comedy. Perhaps even the most talented of young women still couldn't quite have it all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you thought you had a way to fix that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a lucky chap who happened to win a contest to meet Taylor Swift after a concert (sponsored by Coke or Pepsi or Mr. Pibb or... someone. You bought a can of soda for lunch one day and apparently you were a winner, announced in big, bold, capital letters at the bottom of the can.) Naturally, you were quite excited and gossiped (some would say bragged) about it to all your friends. After making exaggerated shows of jealousy, many of them were quick to segue into a cheap joke about you being her \"next celebrity hookup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust an idle joke? Not to a curious, brilliant young mind such as yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy coincidence, you happened to have a bit of a proficiency in chemistry. Being a healthy young man, of course, that proficiency mainly manifested itself in attempts at recreated flatulence and penis enlargers, rather than, say, a life-saving new medicine. The chance to meet Taylor reminded you of an old abandoned love potion project you tried about a year ago. Nothing you tried stuck (although one failed attempt made for a decent hot sauce prank), but now was as good a time as any to try to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, a year away from the project brought just the fresh perspective you needed to try variations on the formula you hadn't considered before. After a few (very messy) misfires, you finally created a stable formula. Further testing on your long beleaguered pet mice saw them falling all over each other. Finally, the miracle potion you had wanted desperately to exist ever since you turned 13 was sitting in one of your beakers right now. Granted, the length of the brewing and testing left you with no time to try for a human subject, but really, what was the worst that could happen? After all, this potion could finally solve the singer's longstanding romantic woes (and your own, completely coincidentally), and what could be a better gift to give a celebrity than that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date of the concert arrived, and it was everything you could ever want from a music event: tons of free swag, a VIP box all to yourself, and a great view of the young singer-songwriter performing a what's-what of her biggest, most ridiculously catchy hits. That view, however, was nothing compared to meeting her in person afterward; between her surprisingly tall stature, the country girl charm of her dirty blonde hair, and those pouty, lush red lips of hers, you were swept off your feet. Suddenly, it wasn't just the formula's questionable effectiveness that had you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's wonderful to meet you!\" she said, her face lighting up in sincere friendliness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey!\" you said a little clumsily, \"That was... really a heck of a show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you!\" she responded, laughing a little at your shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so, I-I actually brought you a gift! Y'know, seeing as this is like a once-in-a-lifetime miracle, I wanted to show my appreciation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching from a bag you somehow snuck past security, you took out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: the first choice is meant to be a \"delayed falling for\" option, with you and Taylor parting ways and her drinking the wine later, while the second one has the effects begin to take place immediately. The third is similar to the first, only with the potential for it to affect multiple female celebrities with whom she shares the perfume.)</span></div></div>",

However, when I heard that Arianna was performing a concert in my home city, Jesus I knew I had to take advantage of that, and I knew just had to do it, over the last few months I had been perfecting my new found abilities especially for an occasion such as this, so I emptied my entire bank account and splashed out on the most exclusive backstage passes which even included a pre show one on one with Arianna. I knew that this was my opportunity and I had to seize it. After a couple of weeks of pure suspense and anticipation the day of the concert had finally come, and I was ready, I packed up my gear and began to drive to the arena. As I approached the stadium I was immediately greeted by security and told to follow them, and after a brief tour of the stage they led me straight to her dressing room. As the large and bulky security guard opened the door I couldn\u2019t believe what was in front of my eyes, their she was, my childhood, teenage and adult crush, Arianna Grande. She sat on a small black chair with her silky smooth legs crossed over each other while her hands were frivolously playing with her luscious brown locks. In preparation for her concert she had on a tight leather skirt and a revealing white tube top. As we began conversation about me being a fan and her latest releases the body guard opened the door and stared me straight in the eyes and said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got 5 minute left\u201d. As soon as I heard that I knew it was now or never, so I immediately turned to Arianna and said, with a slight stutter in my voice, \u201c would you mind if I showed you something cool\u201d to which she replied \u201cof course, but you\u2019re going to have to make it quick\u201d.

Just as I saw her face turn from one of excitement to pure terror I could see that she was about to scream for security so I immediately squeezed the trigger resulting in only a short gasp fleeing from her mouth as her head began to sink into her lap and her arms sagged limply by her sides. I had never actually tested this gun before so one of two things could happen, either her brains will have just melted or she\u2019ll be under my complete control, and obviously I was praying for the latter. So I began to approach her and started to click my fingers in front of her face, after a couple of rather annoying clicks I saw her head begin to slowly raise back up to its regular position, however she just sat their, her mouth shut but her eyes staring emptily into the distance as her mind remained blank, so I decided to begin, whilst hoping for the best. As I slowly returned to my chair I said in a calm voice \u201cAriana, can your hear me\u201d and almost immediately, whilst remaining in the same position, she replied in a monotone voice \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cdo you know who I am\u2019 I said in a rather assertive voice and yet again in a rapid monotone voice she replied, \u201cyes, you are my master, and I must always obey my master\u201d. Although I thought that this would always happen a let out a short sigh of relief as I finally saw that all those months of preparation had finally paid off, but then my heart skipped a beat as I heard the security guard begun banging on the door and shouting if everything was alright, I knew I had to do something soon otherwise all of this will have been for nothing, so I ....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah, alright man, no problem. I'll meet both you guys near the east wing, OK? Alright, later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flipped your phone closed as you opened your door to your solo hotel room. \"Home sweet home\", you sarcastically mumbled to yourself. It certainly wasn't the Four Seasons, but finding a single bed hotel room before a con on short notice was a small miracle you didn't feel like questioning. Normally, you would've happily crashed in your friends' room as usual to avoid the trouble and save money, but if this little experiment of yours really did pay off as you hoped, it would be worth all the money and hassle in the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened pretty recently. Feeling a little peckish, you tried to nonchalantly walk off with a few small Reese's Cups after buying some smokes at the 7 Eleven. Of course, the pissed off foreign dude behind the counter had to give you shit for it, as if a few missing chocolates would drive him to bankruptcy. Normally, you would just give up the game and put the candy back, but something made you feel particularly irritated and demanding. \"C'mon man, it's like 75 cents! Leave me alone!\", you protested as you stared straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely perceptible, but you swear you saw his eyes glow a faint red as his expression and demeanor immediately softened. \"OK, sir.\" he said flatly. Taken off guard by his sudden submissiveness, you hesitantly left the store, candy still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. That guy was known for having a five foot stick up his ass. He would never cut anyone a break, especially not shoplifters, however petty. If it had been anyone else, you probably wouldn't have thought about it. Instead, it was stuck on your mind for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just stared straight at him... That red thing... That had to be something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the limited time you had between then and getting ready for the con that weekend, you decided to experiment. Sure enough, if you focused your gaze intently enough on someone, that red glow would keep coming up, and it would always have the same effect. You started low-risk: you'd make small talk with complete strangers and ask them to scratch their hands while talking. You'd compel a passing jogger to stop and break pace for no reason. You got more than a few extra toppings on your ice cream at no cost. And none of it required even the slightest bit of sweet talk or arm-twisting. You asked. You demanded. Didn't matter. You got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your confidence grew, so did the audacity of the stuff you pulled. You got that cute yet cold receptionist at the gym to give you her phone number, and even admit she thought you were cuter than her boyfriend (A thought you may or may not have \"suggested.\") That cop that pulled you over for going 50 in a 25 not only let you off easy, he made a few hilarious pig squeals as he walked back to his car. Your mom went from pressuring you to get a job to offering to reinstate the very generous allowance you used to get back in middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every single time, that same flash of red...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a fluke. This was legit mind control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course you were going to go wild with this gift on your first weekend getaway in months. The first day was pretty tame, like it is for any con. As usual, you and your buds went to get registered, grabbed some dinner, then hit the sack early so you could hopefully make it to both the dealer's room and the good panels before they got mobbed. Lucky for you, you happened upon a cutie in goth clothes and perfectly dyed white hair in the lobby that night. Sure, she didn't seem to want to be flirted with at first, but she immediately went from short, curt responses to constant touching and suggestive body language once you got a chance to \"work your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it was a good night (Turned out she was a 16 year old virgin, which had always secretly been on your bucket list. Luckily, she wouldn't be calling the cops on you. If it hurt for her, you couldn't tell, since you had already used your power to keep her quiet so you could go as hard as you want without complaints. Damn, it's gonna suck to be the housekeeping crew for this place.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready that single bed room paid for itself, but this was small potatoes compared to your true target. As you were browsing the guest list before making the trip, you eyes immediately shot to one name: Yaya Han. International cosplay model. An A-list name, at least among geek culture. And bona-fide, hot as hell, nerdy boy wet dream come to life. Your eyes immediately widened, hungry for the opportunity. And it was this opportunity that would color not just your first day at the con, not just that weekend, but the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take your new \"friend\" along with you so that you wouldn't look like the usual lonely creep in line to meet a famous hottie. True, she was a bit young for you, but she looked close enough to 18, and you figured taking her along would do more to lower suspicions than coming alone. After you explained to her friends why she'd be spending the rest of the weekend with you (you were very persuasive), you both went off to meet up with your friends. Luckily, they assumed she was just some con hookup, so they didn't ask any questions before you all went off to your event of choice for that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the line to meet a famous female star at a geek convention was long and boring. Sure, you had Whiteylocks there with you to amuse yourself, but a sloppy make-out in the middle of a crowded line would draw attention you really didn't want right now. You waited it out as long as you could, worrying that you wouldn't be able to make it in at all, but sure enough you finally managed to make it to your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were practically shivering in anticipation as you approached her. Those strikingly Asian features, that commanding body language, and, of course, that gift from God himself that was her chest. You couldn't wait to lay claim to all of it. As you walked up to her and returned her smile, you knew that a little small talk was all you had left to get through before you had the woman of every geek guy's fantasies under your thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there! How are you?\" she asked politely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine,\" you answered calmly, \"can I just ask for your autograph?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved to put down a notepad from your bag, you made sure your eyes met hers. And there it was, reflected in those regal, expressive eyes of hers: the red glow that gave you the green light to give the orders you had been carefully rehearsing since that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rip out the bottom sheet of this notepad as discreetly as you can,\" you said under your breath, \"Meet me at the time, place, and address written on it. Make whatever excuse you have to to make it there. Come alone, and don't attract attention to yourself. If anything holds you up, text the number listed. Now laugh as though I just told a funny story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaya's expression, which had been a vapid, vacant smile as you gave your instructions, immediately brightened into a full laugh on cue. Your cover was perfect. You accepted the autograph, then sneakily tore off the bottom sheet on the notepad as Yaya carefully slipped it out with her forefinger and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the con flew by in a haze of restless waiting for that night, where you stood outside the back entrance of your hotel, checking the time constantly. You had to give your friends a lame excuse as to why you'd be late for dinner that night, so this plan had better work perfectly. You held your breath, nervously wondering if she'd come on time, or at all, and if these powers really were too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil...</span></div></div>",

Looks like the powers really compel people above and beyond the call of duty) was walking straight over to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeyy...\" she said as she reached the entrance. Her voice and body language were equal parts flirtatious and vacant. Looking closely at her face, you noticed her eyes were giving off a fainter version of the red glow, as though she were still under her instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually came.\" you said, both confident and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's weird...\" she responded, her body moving into yours provocatively while her face kept the same semi-listless expression, \"I normally don't go out of my way to see my fans much, but there was just something so... interesting about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unbelievable. You had her completely wrapped around your finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you come inside? I've got much more interesting stuff in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot your smoothest line, but it didn't need to be. Your eyes locked with hers and the red glow in her gaze flared up and then died down, signalling her receiving of a new command. You shivered. The thrill of using the power and dominating people never stopped being so intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... Hee hee.\" She said with a light, airy giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, the front desk worker didn't seem to take much notice of your new companion (obviously not a fan of what all these guests were spending their weekend celebrating) and most of the guests had left for a weekend night out, so getting her into your room without being hassled was a cinch. Inside, your bathroom door was opened and your snowy haired con hookup was sitting on the closed toilet seat in a cross-legged position, slowing counting backward from 10,000. Although you were all set to \"trade up\" from her, you didn't have the heart to let her go so quickly, so as yet another mischievous show of power, you kept her occupied in the funniest and most degrading way you could think of. Besides, she might prove useful in the evening's festivities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your delight, Yaya didn't even take notice of her. She was completely entranced, allowing you to lead her anywhere you wanted to (holding hands with a cosplay superstar... a fever dream for most nerds, but a tame warm up for you) with no show of resistance at all. Leading her to the center of your room, you let go of her hand and turned around to face her. An empty smile on her face, her dreamy eye contact with you never broke, like prey hypnotized by a snake. Your plan was a runaway success; Tonight, and for who knows how long after, the international cosplay star was your willing plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to begin?\" you said, smiling back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ah yes Meg Turney, the co-host of the know show on youtube and known as the cosplayer goddess within the community who else would you spend your free time admiring? Of course it wasn't just her body you were admiring no you more mature then that you found her upbeat personality interesting, her skill in cosplaying entertaining and well yes her womanly figure certainly helped keep you concentration. But could you imagine her with you now? Sitting on your bed or sofa watching you play video games or watching a show together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell imagine no more for this how it all begins your time with Meg should I say. First let's set the scene, you are in your bedroom or apartment (make your choice) watching the know on youtube as you tend to do on your laptop or computer,sitting down on your personal chair/sofa you seem to pay little attention to the news being presented to you but more on the two women on your screen Ashley Jenkins and Megan Turney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the pair laugh and joke which you laugh along with making you feel connected to them however quite quickly the video comes to an end leaving you feeling a little disappointed that the show is over and a tiny part of you wondering. I wonder what having Megan Turney around be like? Your imagination could help you picture the simply things like sharing a cup of tea together, joking about games and telling her how much you enjoyed her work but it could also slip in some rather erotic scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine Megan naked on your sofa/chair calling out for you to come to her, desperate for you to please her by making small begging noises and moans that make your pecker stand on end without  second thought. However you quickly shake that little scene out of you head and the rest as it would never happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo your just an average guy who went to a job, came back home, wasted a few hours and then went to bed again to repeat it all over again. A boring way of life perhaps but what about a change? One morning rushing out of your house to your car or bus stop after a night of shall we say self pleasuring, Your mind is still half asleep from the night and thinking of nothing but work and how late you would be you fail to notice the car from behind. It came from nowhere and yet you suddenly go from standing to being flung into the air before falling down onto the pavement below you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds pass as you see a red car zoom off followed by the sounds of police sirens before everything around you goes back. A tragic end for you? No but the beginning of a strange new life. For opening your eyes your surprised to see yourself no longer on the pavement where you lay but now a hospital bed with a nurse and a doctor looking pleased to see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah welcome back. You gave us quite the scare there.\" The doctor said in a calm tone of voice as he begins to look over you. At first nothing made sense but with the nurse calmly explaining that you were hit by a fleeing car and feel into a coma for nearly three days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days. Oh well thank you for helping me.\" You say a little more calmer now with the full picture however you could not help but notice the pain in your head. Like a continues thudding right in the back of your head. Asking the doctor about this made the man frown before telling you that the accident had left some of your brain swelling as such they'd been getting rather strange brain waves from you when examined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm I going to die?\" you ask the doctor and nurse thinking brain swelling is never a good thing. Luckily for you the doctor the doctor tells you your life would be the same only you would stuffer from changes like the thumping in the back of your head. You guessed you could live with this after all what's a thumping head compared to death? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill its what happened next that struck you as odd. For the doctor wanted to keep you in but looking at the small calendar by your bed you remember that Comic con would be in your area soon meaning you'd finally get the chance to meet Megan Turney in person. It was a something you planned a while ago and now really did not want to miss it but the doctor didn't seem to want to budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are still sick I think it best you say here for a few more days.\" Well you thought differently and even though you didn't say it suddenly the doctor changed his tune. In fact he did a complete u turn saying that if I felt all right to go I should. The nurse beside him looked stunned but hey you did not hang around after all who would? Still the fact the doctor changed his mind so quick made you wonder why? And these brain waves what about them? Perhaps you should of asked the doctor however the time is passed and with you now out the hospital you had to find your way home with only a hand full of change in your pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA task you thought would be difficult yet it went rather easy. First you where somehow a bus driver let you ride for free, then at home your neighbour who most of the time would not talk to you allowed you inside their home to give you back your keys telling you they've been looking after the place for you while your were away. So now your back at home and yet something is different, your day which sound have been hell has been in fact rather easy. Too easy like any time you thought hard enough about someone doing something they did it without question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stupid thought popped into you head about you having some kind of mind control power but in the next few days that idea seem to be far truer then you thought. Your boss happily paid you for the days you missed and even gave you a month off of paid work so you could recover. You paid nothing for your bus trips to and from work, cashiers gave you sweets for free and for some reason everything went your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes in the end everything pointed to you to having mind controlling powers. How you got them did not matter you now as now the world was at your mercy you could get away with anything you wanted. So what did you do why you decide to use your new found powers in Megan Turney, she is in town after all and as such your day dreams had a chance to become reality.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to skip to when Megan Turney is back at your place or find out what antics you get up to at comic con?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS.

        "created":1412901960,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Taken from Wikipedia:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On August 31, 2014, a collection of almost 200 private pictures of various celebrities\u2014mostly consisting of women, and with many containing nudity, were posted on the imageboard 4chan, and later disseminated by other users on websites and social networks such as Imgur, Reddit and Tumblr. [It was] later confirmed that the hackers responsible for the leak had obtained the images using a \"very targeted attack\" on account information, such as passwords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale celebrities. Their beauty and status have driven men to the lengths quoted above. They're the ultimate objects of carnal fantasy for every straight boy since he hits puberty. They're the rarefied, the adored, the unobtainable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo fellas (and lesbian readers, I suppose?) why not close our eyes, play pretend, and imagine that level of beauty under our complete control, compelled to satisfy our every desire? Sounds fun? Probably nowhere near as harmful as a massive photo leak, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the title should make clear, this is a mind control fetish story centered around female celebs (we'll cover fictional girls later. Promise.) This is every bit as much your depraved playground as it is mine, so all additions are welcome... provided they follow a few rules, of course:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Write as best as you can. I'll gladly fix any spelling and grammar mistakes as needed, but that's no excuse for a lack of effort being put into the story content itself. (This IS a creative writing website after all.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Keep choice listings to a minimum. I never like it when a good story thread in an interactive gets derailed by superfluous choice listings suddenly cropping up, so stick to real content as much as possible (A long series of celebrity choice chapters in the beginning is probably unavoidable, sadly. I'll try to keep it from getting too messy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You're completely free to use any method of mind control you want. Love potion, hypnosis, psychic power, what have you. All I ask is you not make a series of separate choice chapters asking which method the reader wants. It's just fluff, and it should really be left up to the author.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The term \"celebrity\" is used fairly loosely here. In addition to the usual actresses and pop stars, I plan to add options for categories like cosplay stars, female wrestlers... pretty much anyone you find hot who has some level of name recognition is fair game for addition here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No females controlling males. Same sex controlling is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- One final warning: while there probably won't be much violence in here, there will be a LOT of sexually explicit material. It's nothing you shouldn't be able to handle if you've hit age 18, hence the rating. Don't say I never said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lust's passion will be served; it demands, it militates, it tyrannizes.\" - Marquis De Sade<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy yourselves</td>",
