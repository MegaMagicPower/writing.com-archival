Your heart is pounding too fast for you to want to go back to sleep.  So, you get up and move over to your computer, do a little late-night surfing.  However, as you continue, you can feel your eyelids getting heavier and heavier.  A bright flash from your computer gets your attention and wakes you up fully.  Peering down at the corner of the screen, you see that a tiny monitor has appeared.  Moving your mouse over to click it, the screen suddenly seems to have an implosion impact in the middle, and a vacuum-like force drawing you into the monitor!!  Before you can scream, you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you can see huge, green trees surrounding you, engulfing you.  When your eyes focus, you can see that they aren't trees at all.  They're blades of grass.  You're surrounded by grass!  You've shrunk to a mere two inches tall!  Before you can get your mind to how this happened, the ground rumbles beneath your feet.

He might generally think he's always right, but he has a good heart...  you hope.  You can only hope that these kids are like how you have come to know them on the show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Tai's giant feet and look at him, and whistle softly under your breath.  He's cute, but damn if he isn't intimidating at this size.  Judging yourself by his shoes, you estimate that you've shrunk to only three inches tall!  As far as you're concerned, this kid's well over a hundred feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout up at Tai, but he doesn't even notice - your tiny voice would be drowned out by normal conversation, let alone a shouting match like Tai and Matt have going on.  Lovely.  You decide you're just going to have to climb up Tai to get his attention.  As you grab one of his shoelaces to brace yourself for climbing on top of his shoe, you think to yourself that it's a good thing fabric has a lot of rough handholds for someone your size - and hopefully you're small enough to escape injury if you fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to climb on top of Tai's right foot, standing in front of his sock as it rises out of his shoe into the hem of his pants.  You are wrinkling your nose at the slight smell as you stand there, trying to get up the courage to start the long climb, when Matt pushes Tai and causes him to take an unexpected step back - because like an idiot, you weren't paying attention to their argument.  Startled, you...</span></div></div>",

Quickly, you latch onto it and continue the journey upward as the arguement becomes heated even moreso.  You're a mere fly on the wall... well, more like a tiny bug on the outside of Tai's pants.

Matt's toes released you just as his sole came in contact with Tai's. You grunted as you were sandwiched between the feet of two cute gods.

Your hair was soaked and some of it got into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it feel?\" asked Tai with a chuckle. \"Are you enjoying the treatment?\" Both boys laughed out loud, knowing full well you were suffering.

You've never been that fond of dopey, sickeningly saccharine lovebirds.  And besides, they're walking so close together that if they didn't notice you, you know you'd have almost no chance to get out of the way.  Giants may be portrayed as slow in movies and cartoons, but these kids are certainly a hell of a lot faster than you.  You figure that you have a much better chance of getting Davis's attention anyway, since TK and Kari seem to be more interested in each other than their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your chance, you dart between TK's legs and into Davis's path - a few steps away to him, several hundred feet away to you at your three-inch height.  You start jumping up and down frantically and yelling to get Davis's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't count on is that Davis is also more interested in TK and Kari than in his surroundings, and not in a good way.  As he glowers at them and dwells on his thoughts, he isn't paying attention to what's going on in front of his feet.  He doesn't see you, and at his tremendous height over your tiny form, your diminished voice doesn't penetrate the irritable thoughts running through his mind.  You're like an insect now, and about as significant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he's not going to notice you, you try to flee - but it's too late.  You stumble in the mud, and look up in horror as a shadow falls over you to see his huge shoe, the size of a house, move smoothly through the air and slam directly on top of you.  Time seems to slow for a moment - but you don't even have time to see your life flash before your eyes.  The impact smashes you into the ground as you scream a muffled, unheard cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it seems that you must surely begin to feel everything in your body break and rupture in the blind darkness underfoot, after a second that feels like an hour light floods back into your world.  You feel a tremendous rushing sensation of motion, and see the ground fall away beneath you and fly away at seemingly incredible speed.  Then as you look on, staggered - the world rushes back up to meet you.  You open your mouth, but have barely begun to get out a small choked sound before you slam into the ground again and mud is forced into your mouth and around your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, you realize you have escaped death, but only just - you are stuck in the tread of Davis's shoe!</span></div></div>",

HAVE ANY OF YOU SEEN KARI???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...that aint Ken's voice... his voice isnt THAT feminine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IZZY? KEN? ARE YOU IN THERE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens... in walks a digimon... a cute cat digimon with blue eyes, purple hairs on her cat-ears, a purple and white striped tail, and yellow paws with red stripes... GATOMON! SOOOO cute!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around the room and says to herself, \"Hmmm... where did they go?\" Izzy runs and hides behind his shrink gun. You, however, head toward her and hope she sees you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!! DOWN HERE!!!!\" you scream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Did I just hear something?\" Gatomon says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell again, \"HEEEELLLLPPPP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down... and sees you! \"What the?\" she tilts her head and stares down at you in curiosity! The moment she looks down at you, you freeze in place!!! You remember: She's a cat!! Cats are carnivorous preditors to almost anything smaller than them!! But seeing as though she's a cat DIGIMON, maybe it's a different story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches for you.... you want to run, but you dont have the nerve... youre just scooped up and brought to her eye-level!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a long moment of silence and you shivering in terror.... until FINALLY....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
