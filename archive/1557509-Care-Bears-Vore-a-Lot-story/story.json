Finally you realized that you could ask for some help to the Care Bears. They always seem to be glad helping other kids. Even you knew how to get to the so called Care-a-Lot. (You only have to think in a cloud and from Care-a-Lot land will automatically come a cloud). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out of your house and thought about the cloud that would carry you to Care-a-Lot land. A cloud in a shape of a car came flying to your direction. You jumped inside of it and it automatically returned to its original place. You noticed the rainbow entrance and you thought in stopping there first to greet the Care Bears. You jumped out and landed in the rainbow just to get zapped by a light. You blackened for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this thing was malfuctioning\" said Tenderheart Bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to make a defense machine so that no bad person can come here. It would automatically do that\" said Grumpy Bear, creator of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why making a shrinking machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To... \"minimize\" their actions?\" said Grumpy Bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure. I bet you fix it to shoot automatically\" said Tenderheart Bear very confident about his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will.\" said Grumpy offended and kicking the machine. The machine crumbled and fell apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you ask Bright Heart... he might tell you what to build next\" said Tenderheart sarcastically. \"The only good part of all this is that it did not hit anyone... like many other times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you complaining? You have been enjoying those \"accidental cases\" and many others that have found them\" said Grumpy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you too. Remember not to... finish them all until you fix that machine\" said Tenderheart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. I need to think in a better machine also\" said Grumpy returning to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you waked up, you noticed that the entrance to Cara-a-Lot land was somewhat far. You walked... and then ran to it. It took you about 10 minutes to arrive. You thought that something was wrong and you walked to the central fountain of the plaza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive you found yourself in front of... a 30 feet tall fountain!!! \"Why making a fountain so tall?\" you thought. Then you felt a shake like almost being in an earthquake. \"Earquake? In the clouds?\" You fell backwards and you got stunned when you saw... a 30 feet tall Care Bear. \"What is going on here? Why is everything so big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you realized that you have shrunk  to 3 inches tall. \"Great. I came for help to solve my problems and then I get bigger ones\" you complained. You decide to climb the fountain and to get the attention of a Care Bear. You climbed it and when you reached the top. you began to think in a plan to get their attention. However you were not aware about how close you were from a Care Bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Care Bear/Cousin was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) The bear that complains more than any other Care Bear. Maybe it is because he has to do all the work of a mechanic and an inventor. That is why he is somewhat hungry most of the times. The only thing that he does not complains is the flavor and kind of the food he eats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)Who better to solve your problems than the smartest Cousin of all Care-a-Lot? He surely will find a solution for your problem... unless he gets a mental block due lack of food. But do not worry; he does not need much food to start thinking again... just a little snack solves the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)Power can go to the heads of the leaders. This not his case, as he considers the same as the others... of course of the same size. He incites everyone to be the most caring and helper that they could be. It is a shame he does not shows that when he is hungry.</span></div></div>",

Another victim* thought Grumpy. \"Well, I suppose that I have to do something for you. Come with me, my little sna... I mean friend\" He picked you gently with his paws and carrying you to his house. when you arrived you noticed the house was a bit messy and full of weird stuff and machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being and inventor and a mechanic... it is a nuisance but someone has to do it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think in all these machines?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them. Some others are inventions of the others, specially Bright Heart. God, he needs to relax a little sometimes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took to the kitchen of his house and put in the counter. He sat in a chair and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I am gonna do with you?\" he said \"But where are my manners? You are new here, my name is Grumpy Bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. And about my problem... Can you help me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... that depends if I am in the mood.

I can wait.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not like other humans that want things in a moment or in a short time. I like you\" said Grumpy changing his face in a happy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides we can talk about my other problem... the reason that is why I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping if you could teach me how to make a fine pie\" you said timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pie, huh? Well... I am not professional; but I know how to make a delicious apple pie\" said Grumpy proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds delicious\" you said. \"And I am rather hungry right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good that you mentioned the hunger.\" said Grumpy as he approached you with a bizarre look in his face \"Because I am hungry too.\" his tone was deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then... what would you like?\" you asked a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...</span></div></div>",

Pure and delicious human meat. It was the best we have ever taste\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I happened days ago. I was working on a machine to shrunk any villain that came here to cause troubles... and we accidentally hit two kids that really affected them.

It's meal time\" said Grumpy closing his paw around you and lifting you in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't have to do this\" you shouted. Grumpy did not paid attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...know there still heart in you.

He looked at you and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans are always the same.

You  became pale of fear and tried to break free from his paw. He just chuckled a little and finally said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persistent, as I see. Well I suppose that we have to hurry this up, little girl. So... inside you go\" said opening his mouth again and throwing you inside. He began to savor you and enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were violently carried to one cheek to another. Then it stopped. \"Will he let me out?\" you thought with a little ray of hope in your mind. Your hope broke, when you felt carried to his throat. You tried to hold on his tongue but it was too slippery and you slide down to his stomach. With loud gulp, Grumpy finished his little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh. I found the first food that I cannot complain about anything. It was so perfect... and sweet. How I wish they would be more\" he said patting his belly. Then he burped and chuckled a little <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Oh, well I have to get to work again. I will rebuild the machine, so we can have... more accidents\" said leaving his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout you? Well... I suppose building things needs energy that anyone can get from eating.

Maybe you would have better luck in there. You climb down the fountain and proceed to walk there. But there was a big detail you did not think about... the distance to the forest.

A silhouette was seen going from tree to tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Anybody there?\" you asked. No answers was given, just there was more whispering.

The moonlight increased a little and now you could see the forest a bit more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I see why he could move so fast... Raccoons can see in the dark... I think he is one of the Care Bear Cousins. He might help me\" you thought as you got out and began to walk towards him. But a hand pulled you backwards.

Now can I find them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what are you doing?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not make any noise.

He pushed you inside and he entered while blocking the entrance. Inside was illuminated as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Who are you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are kids like you...\" said one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came here for help...\" said another. \"But I think that was a bad idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why you didn't asked for help to the Care Bears or the Cousins?

Since the accident with the shrink and the victims of its effects... they... well... began to do something really awful things to the kids that got zapped\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what do they do to them...?\" then you were interrupted by a giant paw that came towards you and the others. It grabbed a kid and it went. You and the other four thought it was the opportunity to escape. But in the retreat the raccoon grabbed another two kids. The only ones left were you and the boy. He told you to ran as far away from the forest as you could. He stayed to distract the raccoon... You both ran in different directions. You looked back and the raccoon staying still and that taking out a little notebook and writing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a time for writing\" you thought and continued running. You reached the border of the forest and believe that you were free... when suddenly the raccoon appeared in front of you!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... how did you got here so fast?\" you asked, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just calculated the others speed and yours one... then the distances of reach and it was easy to bring the other to a point where I could catch him and to prevent you from escaping\" said the raccoon as he grabbed you and put you in a jar along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He calculated those things so quickly? He must be a smart one\" you concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... I will take you to my home. It is a bit late and I need some rest\" he said. Then he took you to a little house that looked more like an architect's working place. There were a lot of blueprints of strange machines. Then the raccoon sighed and said \"I cannot think when I am hungry...So would like a midnight snack\" You turned pale when you heard that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon opened the jar and grabbed one of the kids. It was a girl. \"No please... do not it!!! I-I just came here to befriend you\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sweet of your part... But I cannot avoid it... but do not worry I do not chew or bite the food\" he said and tossed her in his mouth and swallowed her quickly. You and the others were in silence, terrified of watching the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon belched and chuckled a little \"Sorry... You know... I really like your taste\" he said. \"I think tomorrow I will have another snack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked, with tears. \"Why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, little girl. If you are good you will be the last one\" he said, while putting the jar in a table and going to bed. \"I think I forgot to introduce myself... I am Bright Heart Raccoon... enjoy your stay in my house\" ans he went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the others could not sleep that night... not if you knew that one of you would be the next.</span></div></div>",

An this time you were more scared than stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it. It is delicious\" she said happily and eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of animal is her...? She is not normal.\" you thought. You ate the salad \"Hey, this is pretty good\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you. After this, would you like to see the sunset? It is pretty beautiful\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I need to relax a little after all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going then\" she said as she picked you and ran outside.

He put you down and panted a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where you live? Bit empty, if you ask me.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good for me\" said Loyal Heart still panting. \"Having or not furniture is indifferent to me. Besides the ground is soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many people or Care Bears come here?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many Care Bears... and humans too come here. And just between us... you are not the first tiny girl or boy that I find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then where...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if they wanted to stay with me for a while. All of them said no, so... since I could not force them to stay with me... but.. I better not mention it.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They returned to normal, didn't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Yes. But now that you are here with me, you may want to stay here and be my human. I always wanted to have someone to play, aside from the Care Bears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? Me? I... do not know what to say\" you began to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoyal Heart then put in a dog's supplicating position. His eyes were so cute and so pure. He just only said \"Please?\" in a really sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless for moment. Finally you answered...</span></div></div>",

Two...\" Loyal Heart began to count. You rapidly caught the point and ran as fast as you could to the forest. You leaned against a tree and stopped to catch some breath. \"I hope he does not find me here\" you thought. But then you saw behind the tree and you saw... Loyal Heart sniffing your trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran fast to other tree. \"Oh please. Don't tell he is...?\" you thought as you ran to another one. You saw him still following your truce.

You became pale and you fell on your back. He then cornered you in the tree. He licked his lips and said \"It's been a while since I ate a little girl. Now it is time for the lunch\" and he approached slowly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I changed my mind...\" you said scared. \"Now that I see you you are perfect for being my partner.

If that is the case... look, there is a shooting star passing right now. Ask the wish for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. I will try it\" you said. You closed your eyes and thought in the wish and \"send\" it to the shooting star. You opened your eyes to see if it worked. Unfortunately, it doesn't. \"Why it did not worked?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... returning to your normal size... is not what you want the most. I think you want something something else... for example, I do not know., a family?\" she asked with an intuitive attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually know what the kids wish more than anyone else. I see them with my telescope. I know that you always wanted a family and a place to call home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" you said a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you say if I make that wish come true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I would say yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.

Our transport will arrive soon.\" she said picking you. Then a star came down and Wish Bear stepped on it. It lifted both of you and took you a bigger star. It had a golden bed and a table with some seats. \"I suppose it has a great view from her. I hope she does not suffer vertigo\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is usually where I see the pass the time in night. *yawn* If you do not mind me, I will go to sleep I suggest you to do the same\" she said and took you to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will\" you said and you quickly fell asleep.

That is not so interesting... I heard about vegetarians that had never eaten meat on their entire life\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to tell you this... but I am not vegetarian... mostly. I only eat meat that is worthy.\" he said. \"For example... some days ago I found that meat. I like it... but after that... I thought I would never find it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to heart that.

YOUR taste\" said Secret Bear with a smirk in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My taste? What is that suppose...?\" you stopped as you saw Secret Bear licking his lips while seeing you.

I forget about that.\" he said grabbing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are kidding right? You do not want to do this... do you?\" you said pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the jokes to Funshine Bear. Now, it is about time for my lunch\" he said and tossed you, in his maw. He enjoyed the taste. He finished it quick, by swallowing you whole. He just let out a sigh and rubbed his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a shame that there are not many of this kind of food. Oh well, I was right, she was worthy to be eaten. I almost forgot about Friend Bear. We need to do something something in the Earth\" he said as got out of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been?\" asked Friend Bear. Secret Bear only did a lot of charades. \"I understand... so you were taking your lunch. That only means that you found another one, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecret Bear nodded. \"Hope that I will find one someday. Only when Grumpy fixes that machine. Well, let's get to the mission\" said and entering the cloud car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to you? Well... I will keep it as a secret. Unless you use your imagination.</span></div></div>",

The only thing she did was to move her hand in sign of greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind helping me?\" you said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...

She lied down in the bench and put you on her belly. She took out the chocolate bar and gave you a piece. it was pink.colored. (For incredible that it sounds).

Come to my hands... my new adopted son\" she said, carrying you gently on her paws and giving you a hug as well, along with a smile.

I just want to be alone for a moment... Do whatever thing you like\" she said going to a room and closing the door. You found the remote control for the plasma T.V. and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, True Heart Bear was walking from one side to another still thinking in your behavior. \"Why I am feeling guilty for him?\" she asked to herself. \"I had another ones as snacks and I never felt this before. Why? Wait, I think I remember know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned off the T.V. (There was nothing good on air) you heard the words of True Heart. What did you do?</span></div></div>",

You know that I do not like to be called like that.\" he said angrily and quickly turning around to see who called him pony. He also revealed a multicolored heart radiating from a central star on his tummy. You got scare by his voice and you ducked. Noble Heart then saw you and changed his voice to a sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but it is just a little human girl\" he said and he picked you up.

I did not wanted to scare you. I was not your fault not know that I do not like to be called pony. I am Noble Heart Horse.\" he said concerning about what he did.

But, I hope you do not get angry, you look like one\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. Almost every new human that comes here make the same mistake; but only a few apologies. That is way I am going to help you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will return me to my normal size?\" you asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly... right now let you ride my back and take you to my home.

I will not accept a no for answer. Now, hang tightly\" he said running with an incredible speed. \"He must be a racehorse\" you thought. For a moment, you felt happy. After all, you always wanted to ride a horse. Also you thought that it was not so bad to stay with him in your size for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrived to a place that resembled a stall.

But... you only half right. A giant pink bear, with a smiling heart holding a little smiling heart in her tummy, sat in the other side of the fountain. She was wearing a white coat and carried a small black medic kit. She opened it and took out a red apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" she sighed. \"I could not asked for a better day to relax. No patients and no missions on the Earth. It is good to have a day off\" she said and gave a bite to the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to walk on the edge of the fountain, searching for a building that resembled a clinic. \"It has to be near of here\" you thought. Finally, you got tired of walking, and you leaned on a wall. But then you realized that something was weird about that wall as it was strangely soft. You turned around and saw that the wall was pink. Then you looked up and saw the bear finishing the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gathered enough courage to talk to her and finally said timidly: \"Excuse me?\" She did not responded. \"Excuse me!!\" you shouted.

You looked around. It had a lot of medical equipment. You stated: \"It is really impressive the equipment you have here but... it is somewhat... small don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because not much come here. For my good luck, everyone cares about their health. Right now, I will make you some analysis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I just want to return to my size\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you are here I suppose you have some time to spend. After that, I might return you to your normal size\" she said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. OK.

However you did not noticed one... it was an aqua marine bear wearing an aqua marine scarf... he was just takin a walk... when suddenly he heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" he wondered as he could heard... your thoughts. Then he went to inspect the origins ofthose little thoughts... and he found it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... maybe I should until one of those Care Bears see me\" you thought. Then you felt someone touched you and then you stumbled in a soft ground... then you felt lifted up in the air. Then in front of you a happy face appeared... at first you were scared... but later clamed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there...\" said the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi...\" you said timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Aqua Bear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice... to meet you... Thanks for noticing me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pleasure...\" said Aqua and he genlty hugged you, being careful to not accidentally suffocate you. His white fur was soft... so you did not mind it. He then began to walk while still holding you and then before you knew it... you both were now in a little clear under a tree with heart-shaped red leaves. the landscape itself was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... it is beautiful...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would like it\" said Aqua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Rose... can you help me with my problem?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... you will have to wait until the machine that did this to you will be fixed... I think 1 week... Until then I will take care of you\" he said hugging you again. This time... you felt a bit unconfortable. Then he began to snuggle his cheek on your little body and again pressed you in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy... what is wrong with him...? He seems to have some kind of hug addiction...\" you thought. Aqua Bear was hearing it... without you knowing it... and he just remained silent. \"Oh boy... why I had to stumble with someone like him... I just hope is not stupid enough to kill me with... his hugs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? I am nice with you... and that is what you think about me?\" asked Aqua with some tears on his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No... I think you are a cool Care bear\" you said. \"Despite being a great nuissance with your hugs\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you are lying... why? I don't like lies...\" said Aqua Bear covering his eyes withhis paws, still sobbing a little. This time... it made you feel a bit a bad... but also this was your chance to leave him and going to get help from someone else.</span></div></div>",

Then you jumped into the ground and were about to leave. \"I need to find someone that is not a crybaby and that is not... propense to hug in excess like this idiot bear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt again that someone grabbed you but this time with a little more of force and more quickly. Also it was a somewhat angry face the one you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it... I just wanted to be your friend... but... you only keep insulting me...\" said Aqua, still with some tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... I am sorry... but I want to receive help... you are a nice guy and everything... but I need help\" you said. \"YOu are completely useless... also you are not nice...\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you keep lying to me... I think we could work this out... but... it seems you are not willing to be my friend\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOu got it right...\" you said... but then you hear a sound that froze yur attitude. Aqua Bear's stomach, rumbling from hunger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I forgot to have my midday's snack... it is a luck I found one right here...\" he said, looking at you and liking his lips. You feel a huge fear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... please... I am sorry...\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I think this time I would like some honey with it...\" said aqua, using his stare to summon a little mapple honey bottle. Then he poured some over you... you felt slimy and sticky... Aqua... then began to lick you a bit, cleaning the honey on you. Then he giggled a bit before throwing you inside his mouth. He then began to taste you slowly. You only got caried from one side to another by his tongue... while aqua was really enjoying your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for doing this to you... but it seems you are not willing to care...\" said Aqua, before swallowing. You tried to stop it but it was futile and you just stumbled and began to slide through his throat. From outside, the lump could be seen travelling through his neck and disappearing in his belly... Aqua Bear just rubbed its belly... and licked his lips, happy of having a great snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Rose... don't think I am bad... but I was hungry\" said Aqua. Then he returned to his normal caring missions... duties. However he was hoping to find... more little things.</span></div></div>",
