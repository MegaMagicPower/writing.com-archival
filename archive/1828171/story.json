The inside of your house was empty and some furniture was knocked over and satanic runes had been carved into one of the walls, but there was no sign of your family to be found, you were home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't your family here?\" The cheerleader asks as she grabs a hold of your hand. \"Huh, no...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wanted to go on... but the loss of everything you held dear, not to mention some sweet cheerleader poon, was too much agony to bear in this life. You took a final look at the outside world and crawled back into bed, never to awake. For two days you faded in and out of consciousness as the toll from hunger and dehydration wracked your body. Surely, this was the end for you... for all of humanity... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the third day without any food or water you heard the roar of wheels and gunfire fill the streets outside. Your eyes caught flashes of light that you thought were hallucinations just beyond your broken window. You were sure you were going mad in your last moments on this earth, that all of the chaos happening around you was just one last sick mad dream. Then a single voice rang out from the front door of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anybody there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to answer but your lips were dry and heavy from lack of hydration. You didn't have the stamina to get out of bed but couldn't miss this last chance at survival. You struggled to raise your arm and pound the wall behind your bed loud enough to get their attention. After a moment of tense silence you heard several more voices come from behind your barricaded door. \"Hey, I hear something in here, get the general! We may have a live one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass out just as a few men in green camo break through your door and rush over to your bedside. You drift through an empty dreamless sleep for several hours before waking up in a bed inside some kind of medical tent next to a few others. An IV was stuck in your arm and a small plastic medical bracelet on your other hand had the words \"NOT INFECTED\" in big green print. A nurse walked in and offered you a lukewarm meal as you slowly rose up in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her what the hell is going on and she apologizes before leaving to fetch a soldier to explain it to you while she tended to her other patients. A man with short blond hair and a beret stepped into the room with a smile and introduced himself as a member of the army rangers before going on to explain what had transpired over the last 48 hours. As it turns out some sort of deadly virus or plague that the US government had never dealt with before spread all across the nation and parts of Canada about a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany people had contracted it and spread it without even knowing it and soon half the population was either dead or undead. Luckily, the military was able to coordinate a strong response to the infection with help from the U.N. and was able to mobilize enough ground forces and firepower to contain and neutralize most of those infected. There were still several states under heavy quarantine, but the worst was over and order would be restored soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at this amazing turn of events you devoured half of your bland hospital food and soon found yourself falling asleep again. True to the soldiers word the world slowly returned to normal as the bodies were collected and burned while police and local officials were reinstated. Progress was slow at first but the news that the last of the known zombies had been killed or captured greatly improved morale among the survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after two long months of recovery and rebuilding, you found yourself back at the gas station standing behind the counter in the early hours of the morning. Of course your worthless boss had survived all this, somehow, and was back to getting on your case about getting your job done. You rub your head as the affectionate woman with the dog walked in to pay for gas and buy a doggie treat for her precious little baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to smile as you hand her the meager amount of change owed from her purchase and wish her a good day. As you put the money into the register you think back on everything you had seen and done over the past few months. All the blood, death, destruction and nightmares you had come to terms with... the walking dead, the loss of loved ones, the agony of sheer hopelessness, the pain of coming within inches of death only to be pulled back from the brink at the last second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering all that suffering made you realize one very important thing though... you'd gladly take it all back if it meant you didn't have to spend another tedious minute in this goddamn garbage fucking shithole of a gas station! SERIOUSLY, FUCK THIS JOB!!!</span></div></div>",

With a furious leap you pull the pins out of the grenades and crash into the lead zombies with a loud thud. They immediately begin devouring you but you die with a smile on your face as about half a dozen grenades go off inside your large intestine and obliterate the horde in a hail of shrapnel and bone. Wow, that was fucking crazy awesome my guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the military appears on the scene a few days later the first thing they notice is a distinct lack of zombies roaming the streets. Little do they know that a badass took out most of their problems just days before in one of the most epic suicides in history.

Haven't you gone through this sort of thing before, only to be chagrined later to find a man in a red coat, or a shaggy red dog? The bell over the door dings, but you ignore it. What they say about drugs, you reflect, is mostly true. They are mostly bad. And you just got this job. Shame to throw it away on another fictional fire; so you stand and blink again, and then stare (meanwhile the bell over the door dings again) off into the distance at the bright orange dot, waiting for it to disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it doesn't, you head outside to get a better look. Behind you, some doofus wants to buy a pack of Juicy Fruit gum, but you ignore him. Yep, that's a fire all right, but no one should be out there, it's a ghost town. Or an empty canyon. Or a deserted desert. You can't remember which. Only that there are no turn-outs near here, and local law enforcement discourages exploration by drifter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch, the orange dot briefly flickers before going out. Then pops into view again, the mystery again. Almost, you reflect, as though someone out there had briefly passed in front of it. But the road ahead is a roaring monster, big trucks screaming by, dust and smoke rising, and on the other side, well-posted No Trespassing signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is going on out there anyway? You don't really know the area. Could the locals be having a bit of a get-together? Because if so, that would sure as hell beat the shit out of this boring shift. They might even have a little bit of smoke, you reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking around, watching the doofus inside, you reflect that the pumps are automatic anyway. Insert credit card, get gas. Duh. Hardly a pressing need for you to be here every second of every moment of every night. A little walk then, across the road, hey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, as you're starting out, the doofus calls, spilling change from his wallet. Ahead, another truck roars, more dust rises. Ignoring both, you climb a little rise on the other side of the road and start out seriously, hair swinging, even smiling a little in anticipation. Yeah, you think. You really could use a bit of smoke right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway there, however, the shit gets serious, and you stop, suddenly afraid. It smells like something bad out here, like death. I mean really bad. And though the fire appears closer, you don't see anyone, you don't hear anything. Where's the damn party? You blink and stare. And again passes that mysterious shadow in front of the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd ug, what the hell is that stink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut onward, right? Haven't you come this far? Behind you, the gas station waits like a bloated beast, with the road in front of it like a squashed snake.</span></div></div>",

The odds of getting caught go way down if they kill the only witness, in your case, me. \"Spikey\" it just came down to did I want to lose my job or my life. My life stinks but not as much as this job.\" He raised up and I said, \"I'll call an ambulance for you\" as I shot him through the heart this time... and I did.

Since I have the action superhero shades, why not become a superhero! But how??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">After about two miles of walking she came across a mysteriously abandoned strip mall. (Don't ask me how it got abandoned, okay? Damned literary license!!)  As she got closer she could see that the mall contained a gun and military surplus store, a gym AND an electronics store. She walked up to the gym to see if she could talk to somebody about joining up. She peered through the window and saw no one was there, but a light was on near the back. So she knocked on the window to see if she could get someone's attention. The she tried pressing the buzzer. No response. Then for the heck of it she pulled the door handle and the door swung open. She walked inside and headed toward the light in the back of the room which looked as if it were coming from some type of office. <br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\u201cHello?? Is anybody-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">No one was there. She began exploring the rest of the building. Besides the office, there appeared to be some locker/shower rooms and near the very back was the storeroom. She walked inside to find that it was nearly crammed to capacity with pallets upon pallets of protein powders and sports supplements. Near the very back were 20 or 30 cases of an experimental female growth formula marked \u201cTO BE THROWN AWAY\u201d  And next to them were 3 pallets of a highly illegal brand of steroids. Along with the brand new shipment of weights and bars, there was enough equipment to keep this gym running for the next 3 years.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n\u201cI guess problem one just solved itself!!\u201d Andrea thought with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEIGHT MONTHS LATER.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c498, 499, 500!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">Andrea dropped the 450 lb. dumbbells she was using with a loud CLANG and walked over to the posing wall in nothing but her microscopic thong. She then did a double-bicep pose and watched with a combination of pride and arousal as her biceps bulged to their full 24 \u00bd inch size. The 5 foot 2 inch, scrawny, barely a B cup girl who had entered the building on that fateful night was gone forever. In her place stood a 6 foot 6 inch tall, 345 lb. 86 GGGG cup super-amazon. Andrea decided to turn the strip-mall in her new home/headquarters. She knocked down the adjoining walls  to both sides of the gym and went about the process of making herself just short of being completely superhuman.  She enrolled in several on line universities and got master's degrees in mechanical, electrical and electronics engineering, biochemistry, criminology, law enforcement, and forensics.  With the electronics equipment, and thanks to the Internet, she was able to create her own set of surveillance gear and gadgetry to use whenever she answered calls for help. She became an expert on every weapon in the gun store, including their proper care and maintenance. After doing proper research on the expired growth formula, she learned that combining them with the steroids only served to exponentially increase their potency and effectiveness. The only \u201cnegative\u201d side-effect was that it also made the formula completely addictive.  Which wasn't really a problem because Andrea got off on watching her body grow larger and more powerful. To mask her location and identity she scrambled all out-going calls and received her missions through her business she called the \u201cMighty Maid Cleaning service\u201d <br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">While the cleaning service was a legit and functional, she really worked as a female mercenary for hire under her new name \u201cLucy Cage\u201d.  She would pose as a ditzy, female bodybuilder/stripper to get close her targets and then gather whatever information was required.  She discovered that her huge muscles and almost inhuman strength had gotten her out of almost as many tight spots as her massive breasts had. And of course her signature piece of equipment, the thing that she never was found without was her black shades.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nJust then someone pressed the door buzzer in the gym. Who was it?</span></div></div>",
