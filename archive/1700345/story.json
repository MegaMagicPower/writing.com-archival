It read six thirty. His school bus was going to be at his house in fourty five minutes. He slowly rolled himself out of bed, walked over to his closet and grabbed some clothes. Before he looked in his closet, he stood in front of his mirror to look at his body. He was only in his tighty whities when he stared in the mirror. He looked down at his belly, noticing that his belly was a little bit bigger than before. His belly was not huge, but he noticed a small layer of fat overhanging his underwear. Jesse could see that he had only gained at least ten pounds, which was not bad. The rest of his body was practically the same, but still, ten pounds was ten pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse continued on with getting himself ready. He wore a tighter long sleeve striped shirt with a pair of jeans. His small layer of fat was a little bit noticeable through Jesse's tighter shirt, but you would have to stare at it to notice it. Jesse then ran downstairs to eat some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran down to the kitchen, he looked again at a clock in the hall. He had at least a half an hour before the bus would be there. He went up to the refrigerator and grabbed some food. After warming up his food, he sat at the table with a plate filled with four waffles, a couple strips of bacon, and a couple strips of sausage. He ate like an animal through his plate of food. After all of the food was cleared from his plate, Jesse warmed up another plate and ate even more. He didn't even notice May Belle, his sister, move past him outside by the bus stop. Immediately after finishing his food, Jesse put a hand on his now tighter belly. His belly was more bloated now, but he didn't mind. Jesse placed his dishes in the sink and walked out to his bus stop, where he saw May Belle talking to Leslie, his best friend. He secretly had feelings for her, but he did not know if Leslie felt the same. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

When Jesse got close, Leslie went up to Jesse and gave him a prominent hug. As she did, her belly felt up against Jesse's belly. She noticed that Jesse had grown a little bit fatter. As their hug ended, Leslie loooked down at Jesse's belly. She could see the outline of his belly through this tight long sleeve shirt. She could even notice his chinkier arms, his bigger legs, even a beginning of a double chin. She was liking what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie had never admitted this to anyone, but she had a fetish for fatter guys. She liked the feeling of fat, and the idea of a skinny person growing bigger for her pleasures. She never told Jesse since she did not know how he would react. All she knew was she wanted him fatter than he was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two continued to talk to each other, both thinking in their heads at the same time. Jesse was noticing Leslie checking out his fat. He was starting to consider getting fatter.... just for Leslie and for his pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso at the time, Leslie was thinking if she should tell Jesse how she felt about fat or just... fatten him up secretly.

Eventually, she would tell Jesse about her fetish, but for now, she knew she would have more fun trying to make it seem like she is not trying to fatten up Jesse. She could challenge him to eating contests and let him eat all of the food, she could cook treats that she would ask him to try, and she could picture him getting to the point of immobility. Just the thought of this made Leslie go wild. But she had to contain ehrself as she was talking to Jesse, who was noticing Leslie was staring at his belly fat. Although he wanted to point it out, he didn't since he wanted to have some fun with her first before he said anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were both thinking and talking, the bus came up to the bus stop. The two children boarded the bus followed by little May Belle who was scurrying from behind. May Belle went and sat with some class mates while Leslie and Jesse went to the back of the bus and sat next to each other. As the bus moved and the two sat next to each other, Leslie could feel Jesse's small muffin top rub up against her at times. She liked the feeling and Jesse loved teasing her. The two continued to talk about Terabithia, their lives, and how boring school was going to be today. Suddenly, Jesse felt a pang of hunger in his stomach that was so loud, Leslie began to hear it. Jesse bent down, exposing his small plumber's crack to Leslie's naked eye. He bent back over and had two twinkies in his hand and tried to hand one to Leslie, who rejected the twinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Jesse, I had breakfast already,\" Leslie told him, trying to seem uninterested in the food so Jesse would eat more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so did I. But if you insist,\" Jesse said as he began unwrapping the twinkies and started stuffing both of them into his mouth. Leslie liked what she was seeing, wanting to stuff him right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jesse looked at her in shock. He had brought twenty twinkies along with him! There was no way he could stomach them all in one sitting! But when he saw Leslie's beautiful face smiling and being very enthusiastic, he came up with the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'll do it just for you,\" Jesse said as he started eating. He grabbed a few twinkies and started to tear one open. He started to eat as the first four twinkies went down easily. Twinkies number five, six, and seven went down slower than the first few. When he got to twinkie eight, he burped and swallowed it with difficulty as he felt like a pig. Leslie kept on smiling as the guy she liked was forcing himself to eat just for her. For the next four twinkies, he almost had to force himself to eat the twinkies. While the thirteenth one was in his hand, his other hand was on his belly which had gotten quite taut from pigging out on the twinkies. But he was doing all just to please Leslie. As he looked at the twinkie, he moaned with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat anymore, Leslie. I feel so fat and full right now,\" He said as he removed the twinkie filling off the sides of his mouth. Leslie looked at him and tried to think of what to do to stuff him more. She then came up with an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could feed the rest to you,\" Leslie said with a seductive grin. Jesse then thought about it. Although he was still a little reluctant, Jesse nodded to her as Leslie put half of the twinkie in his mouth. He ate the rest of the twinkies that way as Leslie smiled with delight. When the last twinkie entered his stomach, he moaned and laid back feeling half satisfied and in pain. His stomach was swollen out more as it looked like he gained another inch in diameter. His shirt slowly rode up his belly, exposing a little bit of it to the world. Leslie started rubbing it, which let Jesse relax a little while and make Leslie happy. </span></div></div>",

Leslie was still enticed by the idea of Jesse getting bigger, willing to do anything to see him grow. They walked into the classrom and headed for their desks, ready for the pointless idea of learning. Both of them breezed through the subjects they were good at, Jesse being good at math and science and Leslie being good at language arts and history. As time flew by, they were both surprised to hear the lunch bell go off. As all of the kids left the class and headed to the lunch room, Leslie and Jesse followed behind while talking to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment they got into the lunch room, they rushed into the lunch line and grabbed trays. Leslie made sure to put Jesse in front of her so she could see what he was getting for lunch. He started to load his plate with french fries, cookies, a couple of chicken tenders, and a coke. Before Jesse moved to the register, Leslie stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you're going to eat?\" Leslie asked, trying to sound amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I mean, this is normally how much I usually eat. Why?\" Jesse asked Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's just that I think you can eat more than that. I bet you can,\" Leslie said with a grin. She could see Jesse starting to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well regardless, I only have three bucks for lunch. I can't get anymore than this,\" Jesse said as he held up his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you have six bucks,\" Leslie said as she took three bucks out of her pocket and gave it to Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but no thanks. I would feel bad,\" Jesse said as he tried to resist the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it. I insist. I know you'll eat the food,\" Leslie said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Jesse smiled back, taking her words to heart. Because of Leslie, Jesse put double the amount of food on his tray and headed to pay for it. The lunch lady gave him a look, but he ignored it as Leslie kept on smiling at him. They both then headed outside to eat lunch on some benches. Jesse took another look at his food, wondering if he could even manage to eat all of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jesse. Eat,\" Leslie grinned.</span></div></div>",

Jesse looked over at Leslie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Leslie. This is a lot of food. I don't think I can eat it all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can. You're a growing boy and you need food. And if you can finish it all, I'll show you a new place in Terabithia that I found. It's awesome!\" Leslie said while she smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Jesse couldn't resist Leslie's smile and dug in. The two cheeseburgers went down pretty smoothly, even though he still felt a little full from the Twinkies. The first large fry went down a little slower than it would normally take him. The second fry was almost painful to eat. Drinking the first soda, he burped and moaned in pain. Beginning on the cookies, Jesse shoveled them into his mouth to get it over with. With the six cookies demolished, the only thing left standing was the Dr. Pepper. By now, Jesse's belly was much bigger than it was on the bus. Moaning in pain, Jesse rubbed his overstuffed belly, which stuck out a good four inches than it normally did. Leslie, seeing his pain, decided that Jessie had eaten enough. Instead of saying anything, she just reached her hand under the table and rubbed Jesse's aching belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhhhh, owwwww, thought Jesse. Barely able to think, Jesse just sat in his seat, unable to move or talk. All he could do was sit and enjoy the little comfort that Leslie's belly rub gave him. Jesse had never eaten this much before in his life, although he started remembering that there was that time last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a year ago, when Jesse was eleven, his father decided that they would go to their Aunt Clara's house for Thanksgiving that year. Now, Clara lived three hours away, and she had much more money than Jesse's father and mother did. To the family, this was a rare treat. Trying desperately not to explode from joy, Jesse and May Belle got into the truck and began the trip while the rest of the family followed. The ride there was uneventful, but all three hours of the trip were devoted to Jesse fantasizing about all the good food waiting for them at Aunt Clara's: turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes, and Aunt Clara's supposedly legendary rice pudding. Jesse's mind wandered for three hours until they pulled up to a mid-sized house painted a pleasant blue. There were lights in the house that was accompanied with an overall warm feeling. As soon as they walked in the door, Aunt Clara kissed them all over and quickly sat them down at the table. Jesse had gaped at the arrangement of food before him. All of the turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, beef stew, and delicious looking fruit salad made his mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour was a blur. Jesse had taken good sized helpings of everything, cleared his plate, and asked for seconds. Quickly putting that away, thirds arrived on Jesse's plate. Finishing this off, and although he was full, Aunt Clara piled fourths onto his plate. Not wanting to be rude, Jesse ate it, though his stomach was not happy with him. After his fourth helpings were in his tummy, Clara brought out three kinds of pie: cranberry, pumpkin, and blueberry. Jessie, smelling them, took a piece of each and devoured them. Aunt Clara commented that he had a healthy appetite and gave him more pie. Nearly at the point of bursting, Jesse complied. And, to his horror, Clara brought out servings of rice pudding. Always polite, Jesse force-fed himself the pudding, which, though delicious, nearly brought tears to his eyes. Once the pudding was gone, Clara thanked them for coming and they left all. On the ride home, Jesse finally lost it. He burst into tears. His father asked what was wrong, and when Jesse clutched his stomach, his father pulled over and got out of the truck. He walked around to Jesse's door and opened it. He lifted Jesse's shirt slowly. When he saw Jesse's stuffed belly, he started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally go your first Thanksgiving stomach ache, huh bud?\" Jesse's father said. Jesse's only reply was a small sob. His father took another look and turned the truck around. They all got back to Clara's house and Jesse's father explained the situation. Clara said that they could all spend the night. When Jesse was settled into a bed, still in pain, Clara came in. She took his shirt off and moved her fingers slowly around his bloated abdomen. Slowly, the pain lessened, and Jesse fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering this time, Jesse really thought he could use Aunt Clara's fingers right now. Even though he had eaten more then, she was a goddess with her fingers. Just then, the bell interrupted his thought. When he didn't get up, the nurse walked over. Jesse, still in a trance-like state, only heard bits and pieces before he drifted into a food coma slumber. </span></div></div>",

Jesse walked over to the scale that the nurse kept in the corner. Stepping onto it, he remembered that before his weight gain, he had weight about 100 pounds. The dial spun until it stopped on 126. Jesse stared at the number. Twenty six pounds! He had gained twenty six pounds. Jesse felt his now softer belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what twenty six pounds feels like,\" Jesse thought, thinking about his new weight. His mother would eventually find out. She always knew when her children were hiding something. It was one of her special talents. Jesse resigned himself to the fact that this would not go unnoticed. He wondered if he should work out before it was noticed, but then his mother would know something was up because Jesse never worked out before. While he was still wondering what to do, the nurse walked back in. She saw him on the scale, then realized the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jesse, come here,\" she said. Jesse obliged, and the nurse sat down with him on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, I noticed you standing on the scale. And I've noticed the pudge you've put on lately, but it's nothing to worry about. How much have you gained?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked at his feet, feeling uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty six pounds,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then you're still at a healthy weight.

They decided to hang out in Jesse's room for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jesse, are you feeling better?\" asked Leslie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've gained twenty six pounds, Leslie. I think maybe I should eat a little less. I don't want to get obese,\" he said. Outwardly Leslie shrugged, but inwardly, she was crying. In order to keep her fantasy from falling apart, she quickly thought of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, no one will notice. I didn't notice until you told me just now. Trust me! It's nothing major,\" Leslie said. Jesse was still looking confused, but then his stomach rumbled. He looked at it in surprise. Leslie laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, I think I know what to do. Why don't we go to Dairy Queen and get some ice cream?\" Leslie asked. Jesse agreed with her and they walked down the road to Dairy Queen. Once they got there, Jesse ordered a large chocolate ice cream with whipped cream while Leslie got a medium vanilla. They sat down and dug into their ice cream. When they were done, Jesse burped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I didn't know if I could eat all that,\" He said as he rubbed his full belly, not stuffed like before, but pleasantly full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice manners, Jesse!\" Leslie said with a laugh. Jesse blushed and wiped the chocolate off his mouth. Jesse stood up, ready to walk home, but instead, Leslie asked him if he wanted to come to her house for dinner. He agreed, unable to resist her smile, and they walked to Leslie's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived, Leslie's parents welcomed Jesse and said that dinner wouldn't be ready for at least a half hour, which made the pair go outside again. Jesse plopped himself on the grass with Leslie next to him. His stomach rumbled again. Leslie laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're really hungry!\" She said. Jesse smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so!\" He agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat until dinner was ready and then made their way to the house. Sitting down at the table, Jesse saw a large array of food: meat loaf, corn, mashed potatoes, salad, and bread all waited on the table. They sat down, and Jesse, just like at Thanksgiving, took good sized helpings of everything. He polished his plate and asked for seconds, followed quickly by thirds. His already tight shirt was now straining at the buttons. Not wanting to be a pig, Jesse tried to decline fourth helpings, but Leslie's mother insisted that he was a growing boy. Following the fourths were fifths on his plate, which were then followed by sixths. Finishing the helpings, Jesse prayed that there wasn't dessert as his stomach was already aching. But, to his dismay, Leslie's mom brought out a large chocolate cake for her husband's birthday. After singing Happy Birthday, Jesse and Leslie's father both received three slices of cake. Leslie's father gobbled them down, not having eaten as much as Jesse previously. Jesse, on the other hand, slowly chewed his way through the slices. On the final bite, one of the buttons on Jesse's shirt popped off. Jesse's face fell with dismay as a huge wave of pain hit him, causing him to double over in pain. He had eaten more tonight than at Thanksgiving last year. While doubled over, his shorts button popped off. Leslie and her mom rushed over and helped Jesse to the couch, where he lay down and let tears silently fall from his eyes. His stomach, now feeling as if it was on fire, was now rounded out perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie called Jesse's parents and asked if he could spend the night. They agreed because it was a Friday. Leslie sat by the couch with Jesse. Eventually, the strain on his shirt was too much and another button popped off. Jesse's hands fumbled with the rest of the buttons, trying to relieve his stomach of the pressure. Leslie moved his hands away and slowly undid the buttons causing pressure. Jesse sighed in relief because he wanted every bit of comfort he could get. Leslie got up after a while and came back with a blanket, which she put on Jesse. On the other side of the blanket, Leslie massaged Jesse's stomach. Jesse, with nothing else to do, let his mind wander until he drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, it was the middle of the night. His stomach still had a bit of a bloat to it and still ached. Leslie was sleeping on a couch across from him. With a bit of effort, Jesse got up and walked to the bathroom. His shirt half off, he could see his belly in the mirror. It looked taut and felt firm to touch. Jesse was thirsty, but he still felt like he might burst, making him leave the bathroom. Laying back on the couch, he thought about his day. He had eaten more today than he had in three days. He was sure this was only going to add more weight. He really was worried now. If his Mom found out, what would she say? Would she put him on a diet? What would happen? With these thoughts on his mind, Jesse went back to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, he was surprised to see that Leslie had woken up first. She was in the kitchen, getting a bowl of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God,\" Jesse thought. He didn't want to eat a lot this morning. He got up and walked into the kitchen</span></div></div>",

They hugged his legs and butt and stomach and chest. He felt as the he was being compressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still felt overstuffed from the night before, which is why both he and Leslie were slightly surprised when an audible growl could be heard and felt enenating from his stomach as he eyed her eating her bowl of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, uh, Leslie, are you gonna fi\u2014 \u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJesse, why don\u2019t you take the rest of my bowl and I can see when my parents are going to be down to make us a real breakfast\u201d Leslie cut him off. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you s\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cYes Jesse, you\u2019re clearly hungry.  Plus I already had a bowl before you woke up. I wasn\u2019t going to be able to finish it anyway\u201d  <br>\r\nJesse had his doubts about her having a bowl prior, but his renewed hunger as she placed the bowl in front of him gave him little room to care. He let out a belch, relieving some of the stuffed feeling from the stuffing the night before, and started to dig in to his cereal. Unfortunately, his contentment was short lived, as he finished the bowl alarmingly fast. His stomach let out another growl. Where was Leslie? She said she\u2019d be right back.  He eyed the room. The box of cereal still stood on the kitchen counter. Another bowl wouldn\u2019t hurt, plus given the pace leslie seemed to be moving at, he\u2019d probably finish it before she got back. <br>\r\nAnd as he looked back and forth between the box in his hand and the bowl in front of him, he quickly came to the realization that the bowl was simply too small. <br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled again. <br>\r\n At least for how much he intended to eat. He grabbed a larger bowl, and filled it to the brim with cereal, nearly emptying the box of its contents. He then proceeded to slosh a suitable amount of milk in. With that he dug in. </span></div></div>",

After finishing the box of cereal, leslie and her parents had finally made it downstairs, and had started to make what seemed like a never ending assortment of breakfast food. Jesse had ended up eating AT LEAST three massive  servings of scrambled eggs, nearly all of the French toast (leaving around 5 pieces for Leslie\u2019s entire family), a great deal of the bacon, and no less than four bowls of fruit salad. Even after eating all of that though, Jesse was <i>still</i> hungry. In fact, as he covered the relatively short distance back his house not only  did he hear it rumble, but he also felt a pang of hunger in his burgeoning stomach. <br>\r\nAs he entered the house though, he swore to put off eating for as long as possible. This couldn\u2019t be healthy and his clothes barely fit him at this point. Not only were they tight, but they were riding up his legs, stomach and arms, almost as if they were too short. Either way, Jesse decided the best course of action was to take a nap before the day really started. It was still relatively early, 7:30 AM, and an extra thirty minutes of sleep honestly couldn\u2019t hurt. <br>\r\nAs Jesse came to though, he realized he couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. His stomaching ached to the point of tears coming to his eyes, and as he stood up, another problem became apparent. His clothes simply no longer fit him. Not only were they too tight, but they were also too short. He was less concerned with whether he had gotten taller though, and more with whether he would have anything that fit. Thankfully he managed to find an oversized hoody that managed to hide his every growing stomach and upper body, and a pair of pants that had previously been baggy, but now hugged every part of his legs. Now he just had to get his shoes on. But the longer he looked at them, the less likely it seemed he\u2019d be able to fit his foot in them. Not only did he feet look much too wide, but they seemed at least a size to big to fit in the confines of his sneakers.  With that in mind he quietly made his way over to his parents room. He\u2019d have to borrow a pair of his dads, even if they were a little too big. As he slid what seemed to be an old pair of his fathers sneakers on, he was pleasantly surprised. They fit almost perfectly, albeit they were a little long, but the rudeness of his feet certainly made up for any looseness. From there he headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth and hair. Looking at his reflection he was able to gauge some differences. His face was rounder, perhaps not noticeably so, but to anyone looking closely it was clear, with the infancy of a double chin starting to form. The sweatshirt thankfully hid a great deal of his growth though, so his parents probably wouldn\u2019t question him about his sudden increase in size. He was drawn out of his reverie though as another pang of hunger hit his stomach. He had to eat, putting it off had been about unwise as anything he had ever done. <br>\r\nLuckily his parents were preparing a big before school breakfast. </span></div></div>",

He may be concerned about Leslie\u2019s questionable idea to have himself stuff all of it than anyone did, but he wouldn\u2019t want to turn it down and eat and eat for her sake.  Even though he had gained some weight before it, which caused to make Leslie some attention and otherwise secretly wanted to see Jesse bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat may be proven so, when it was the first day of the summer break, and he was able to have a long lie just as he wanted.  He felt so much tried even more than he usually was, and would normally slipped in a couple of times, despite he set the alarm clock to wake him up.  Luckily, it\u2019s summer and Jesse has gotten up about 10am with that great big yawn, which he never let it such a loud noise like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would then get up and climbs out of the bed, causing it to creak so heavily than it usually does underneath him before.  That\u2019s when the biggest change came and Jesse is now obese in a gigantic way.  His belly is so huge, it overhung his tight underwear he\u2019s only wearing, and even his butt and thighs are even huge, making his body more like a pear-shape.  The rest of his body looked so thick and had fat rolls with him, and he even had a couple of chins and moobs that caused his body to balloon up massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he would do is to check the scales in the bathroom, and every time he takes a step, it causes the floor to thud loudly and his meaty thighs jiggle and clapped together as a result.  Jesse has to get through the doorframe which he finds himself almost difficult to make some squeeze and just brushed it by the time he gets himself through into the bathroom, where the scales are on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse wastes no time but to step onto the scales, waiting for the numbers to start rolling in.  Three months ago, he weighed at 126lbs after he initially gained to begin with.  Right now, the figures are still counting and Jesse may seem to be nervous for the first.  He would had to wonder how massive he\u2019s been putting on, and that may be the case when it stopped, causing the youngster to look down and is in disbelief from how much he weighed just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!

I really let myself go a lot. <br>\r\nJesse then started dressing himself by putting his biggest pair of pants. Needless to say that they were far too tight for his expanded body. He tried to pull them up his butt that had gained a few more inches of circumference but the pants just wouldn't pass. He started jumping up and down wich made him soon out of breath but it still helped the pants to pass his ass. Now, he needed to buttton them and that was the most difficult part. Jesse tried to make the button reach his hole by sucking in his belly and after a good five minutes, he succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took his biggest shirt and started buttoning it. The buttons were straining so much that there was a  hole between each button wich made people see his belly. Jesse then grabbed his things to go downstairs but he catched a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He really could see the damage of his massive eating. He undressed himself to really see how he looked now, even if he knew it would take him a long time before he would be dressed again because of his tight clothes. His belly was sticking out considerably and he had love handles, creating a muffin top to Jesse. His pectorals were now looking more like man boobs and his thighs and butt were way softer than he remembered. His face was fuller and he had the beginning of a double chin.<br>\r\n-No wonder my clothes don't fit anymore, I have gotten so fat!<br>\r\nJesse made his belly jiggle a little and dressed himself, wich took ten minutes to do. He went downstairs and started to eat his breakfast, making him bloated. His buttons were now really close to popping up but Jesse didn't seem to be bothered by it so he went to the bus stop. He arrives there and notices that Leslie is not there yet but he then sees her coming. She arrives and looks at Jesse's shirt, impressed by how strong the buttons are. Leslie sees Jesse's belly between each button and finds it very arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, does she tells something about how his clothes are so tight</span></div></div>",

It was accidental as she went into Terabithia alone and went to the other side of the river from a rope on a tree. However, the rope being old and frayed, snapped and made her fall into the river where she drowned. Jesse wasn't there and he didn't forgive himself. He felt that he could've prevented Leslie's death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last couple weeks were filled with engagements such as Leslie's funeral, crying, and watching Leslie's Mom and Dad move out of their house and away from the Aaron's family.

He was in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past few weeks, Jesse never left the house.

His parents knew that Jesse needed his time to mourn, but it was beginning to take a toll on him. With him not working out and continuously eating, he had gained a few miniscule pounds on his frame.

Sadly as she went across the river on a rope, the rope broke and Leslie made a nasty fall. Luckily, someone found her, although Leslie was wounded. After afew weeks, Leslie made a full recovery while Jesse visit her everyday. During Leslie's recovery, Jessie made a wooden bridge to prevent any more accidents.Leslie first had the idea of using another rope but Jesse disagreed. A rope could break again. This time Leslie was lucky but who knew what could happen if the rope would break again. Eventually, the two kids both headed back to Terabithia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Leslie!\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" Leslie yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him. Only a sticking plaster above her right eye reminded them about her fall. <br>\r\nJesse never told anyone but he felt responsible for Leslie's fall. He should have never let Leslie go on her own. He felt like he should have asked Leslie to go with him to the museum. He should have been with her.<br>\r\nNow they were planning too go swimming in Terabithia. Jesse advised her to put on her bathing suit at home just like he did. Sure they liked each other (and maybe even more than they both thought). But Jesse didn't know if he was ready to see Leslie naked. He also didn't know if he was ready to let Leslie see him naked. Both of them had a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we never went swimming before in Terabithia,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well before the accident, it wasn't exactly the best weather for swimming. Plus I have been in bed for a few weeks. That was the most boring time of my life. I'm happy we can go back to Terabithia,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do wear your bathing suit?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course! My bikini. I wear a bikini,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough. It only matters if you can swim in it,\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"That should be no problem.,\" Leslie said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was glad to be back in Terabithia, smiling, until they reached a lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Do you see those sea snakes?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse did see some lumps in the water, which was the long body of a sea snake. He smiled and looked at Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will he attack us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Sea snakes stay in deep water and normally don't attack people. So i don't think we have to worry,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled off her clothes until she was just in her bikini. Jesse also pulled off his clothes. But suddenly, for a moment, her got distracted by Leslie's belly. It seemed a bit bigger then it had been before. Not too much though. And thanks too Leslie's wide shirt, he didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you gain weight?\" He asked. He then hit himself, realizing what he had just asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat boy would ask a girl if she gained weight? Girls were obsessed about their weight. But on the other hand, Leslie wasn't like other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I gained some weight since my parents forced me to stay in bed while i recovered from the fall,\" Leslie said, unoffended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie walked on some of the rocks and looked at the water. Leslie first felt the water with his toe and then ran into the water. Soon, Jessie hopped into the water and swam to Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could beat you in running! Maybe also in swimming!\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was some time ago, my Queen! I've become faster,\" uttered Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've had time to practice while I needed to stay in bed. So you may be able to beat me,\" admitted Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone would have told Jesse that he would be defeated by a new kid who was a girl in the first race, later would become best friends and become king and queen of a magical world and would swim here, he wouldn't have believed that guy. But now he did. He almost forgot Leslie defeated him. Well if you got defeated, you could be defeated by your best friend, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued swimming and jumping in the water and sun bathed. But every time he saw Leslie and her belly, he felt something. He liked to see it. At one moment, she suddenly stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it bothers you that much, I will lose it!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... what?\" He asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie stood up straight with her hands in her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not blind. Since we came here, you've been staring at my belly. If it bothers you that much that I gained some weight, I'll lose it,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was bothered by it? I was looking at it since I think I... like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you've been looking at my belly because you liked that it was bigger?\" She asked blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do,\" Jesse answered and blushed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... should I gain some more weight?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well only if you want to,\" Jesse said. </span></div></div>",

Through all of this conversation, Jesse couldn't help but continue to stare at Leslie's body in amazement. He liked Leslie a lot, but the added on weight made him turned on to her even more. Jesse was wondering if he really had a chance with Leslie. He had a feeling that Leslie may have a crush on him, but he was never really sure about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to talk, many thoughts also went through Leslie's head. She was really wondering if Jesse felt the same way as she did. Leslie really liked Jesse and she saw the fattening idea as a plan to have some fun, relax, and please Jesse at the same time. At the same time though, she had no idea why he liked more weight on Leslie's body. Jesse was thrilled that Leslie was going along with this plan and planned to make this as enjoyable as possible for both of them. The pair decided to go home, get dressed, and come back to the lake to put their plan into action.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jesse stood in his kitchen staring at his cupboards. He was excited, but wary. The pair's hastily made plan was pretty much to grab some food and hang out by the lake while Leslie ate. But he didn't know how serious Leslie was when she said she would gain. He didn't know how serious he was when he said he wanted her to gain. He had never felt anything like this before. But seeing that tiny bit of chubby fat on Leslies belly, those three or so extra pounds, had awakened something in him that he couldn't ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what should he bring? He didn't want to come on too hard and scare her.  What if this ruined their friendship? He shuddered. Maybe this wasn't a good idea. Maybe he should just go back and calling the whole thing off was all he could think of. But he just couldn't. Now that he had that feeling, he wanted more. He could picture Leslie in his head with a large, bulging pot belly, a muffin top, and larger breasts straining at her shirt. He wanted that image to be real. And she had agreed to doing this. To what extent she was willing to go to, he didn't know. But to be safe, Jesse decided to start off small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how small? Jesse began rummaging through his kitchen. They had plenty of food in the house. There were several bags of potato chips, boxes of Hostess cakes, some leftover cake from a cousin's graduation party, a box and a half of Oreos, and other various snack foods. After thinking it over for a bit, he decided to bring a box of Oreos and a half-full gallon of milk. Feeling the weight of the milk in his hands, he grabbed two plastic cups. He just couldn't imagine Leslie, who was so thin and such a light eater, eating a lot. Just in case, he would have some, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo off Jesse went with his food in tow. He soon crossed the bridge into Terabithia and as he walked toward the lake, he saw Leslie sitting on a blanket, looking out over the lake. As he jogged closer, he was surprised to see that she had brought food of her own and lots of it!  His eyes widened as he spotted two unopened bags of chips, a two liter of Coca-Cola, a plastic-wrapped plate with some cinnamon rolls, and half of a cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d He exclaimed as he ran toward Leslie. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the food? I said I\u2019d bring it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie whipped her head around at the sound of Jesse\u2019s voice.  She was chewing on an Oreo that she had gotten from her own package on her lap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a good thing I brought some food,\u201d  She said through a mouthful of Oreo. \u201cThat's because you brought nothing. A pack of Oreos and some milk? I thought you said you wanted me to gain weight, not eat a snack,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2026 that is what you want, right?\u201d She said more cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, ya, that\u2019s what I want,\u201d Jesse said, blushing, \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to, ya know, scare you\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jesse. I get it. But when have I ever been scared of an adventure?\u201d Leslie said. \u201cNever. That\u2019s when. Now come over here and give me some of that milk!\u201d Leslie said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse sat down next to her and handed her the half-full carton, which she promptly opened and took a swig of. Then, Leslie took three Oreos from her already opened package and managed to shove them all in her mouth at once,  making her cheeks bulge out. Jesse laughed as she struggled to chew her mouthful of cookie and as soon as she managed to swollow, Leslie started laughing as well. Soon, they were having a grand old time, laughing and chatting between Leslie's bites and sips.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jesse couldn't stop looking at all of the food and wondering if Leslie could really eat it all. </span></div></div>",

She burped again. It was uncomfortable, maybe even painful, but it was for Jesse. And if it made Jesse happy, it made her happy. Besides, she thought, it wasn\u2019t all bad. She kind of liked the heavy feeling inside of her. Like she had swallowed a weight. The thought made her giggle, but that jostled her tummy, so she quickly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was beginning to get comfortable, Jesse spotted something; over half of the 2-liter of Coke had been tossed aside and forgotten in the midst of the feast. Looking over at Leslie\u2019s bulging belly, he wondered whether he should point it out to her. Her belly seemed pretty stuffed\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026But then again, hadn\u2019t she said that she was never scared of an adventure? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Leslie,\u201d Jesse said slyly, \u201cLook at what we forgot!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie, who had her eyes closed, opened them slowly. When she saw what Jesse was holding, she had to force herself not to groan. Could she take that much more liquid in her belly? She looked at her gurgling organ, the little dome that was pressing against her shirt. She looked at Jesses face, which somehow managed to fit between anxious and excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed inwardly. For Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me up,\u201d She said, holding out her hand. Jesse obliged, pulling her into a sitting position. The sudden change in direction didn\u2019t make Leslies stomach happy, and she had to stifle another burp. Jesse didn\u2019t notice, and held out the 2-liter for her. Leslies arms, however, were preoccupied propping herself up. She looked at Jesse sheepishly. \u201cCould you\u2026 hold it up for me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jesse said, unscrewing the cap and letting the fizz hiss out. Then, careful not to spill any soda on Leslie, he began pouring it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Leslie was able to focus on the flavor of the Coke as it poured into her stomach, filling up any empty space in her crowded belly. But after the first few gulps, her stomach was filled completely. With every swallow, she could feel her belly swell. She closed her eyes and focused on drinking the bubbly pop, but it couldn\u2019t stop the aching that was only getting worse with each sip. Propping herself up on one arm, she rested one hand on her belly, feeling it bulge out a little more with each gulp. \u2018Oh gosh..\u2019 she thought worriedly, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can finish this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse, of course, didn\u2019t notice Leslies discomfort, for he was mesmerized by her stomach. He watched in amazement as it slowly filled in perfect sync with the emptying 2-liter. He couldn\u2019t help but stare as Leslie\u2019s belly swelled, pulling up her tight shirt and revealing a sliver of pale skin. He watched as that sliver grew and grew, slowly moving up toward her belly button, until- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie moaned as she dislodged her mouth from the empty bottle, unable to hide her discomfort any longer. She gently laid herself down on the blanket, both hands gently resting on her stuffed stomach, which now looked like she had eaten a bowling ball- and felt just as heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d She groaned again, looking at Jesse, \u201cThat\u2026 was pretty tough\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked at her worriedly. \u201cAre you O.K? Was that too much? Oh, I\u2019m really sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have done that, I-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Leslie cut him off. \u201cOh, stop that. My belly just hurts. No pain no gain, right?\u201d she said, not quite as firmly as she usually would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d Jesse asked, still afraid he had ruined his chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all. Just wish that my belly didn\u2019t hurt so much\u2026\u201d She said, looking at her jeans\u2019 straining button, wishing she could undo it. But no, not in front of Jesse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could\u2026\u201d Jesse started, but cut off quickly, blushing. \u201cNo, never mind, stupid idea\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie tilted her head to look at him. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m willing to try any thing. This thing really hurts\u2026\u201d She said, patting her midriff gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I could give you a belly rub\u2026\u201d He said, blushing wildly. \u201cI know, stupid idea, never mind\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leslie said hurriedly, \u201cthat actually sounds really nice right now,\u201d Jesse looked at her, astounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d He just couldn\u2019t believe his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo for it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, reluctantly, as gently as he could, Jesse rested his hands on Leslies taught belly. He began to rub in gentle circles, careful not to press down too hard. \u201cOh, that feels good\u2026\u201d Remarked Leslie. So he pressed a little harder, rubbed a little faster. He could feel the tightness of her skin begin to soften under his fingers. It was an amazing feeling he just couldn\u2019t describe\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that feels really good,\u201d Leslie sighed. Jesse continued rubbing. His eyes flickered to that small crescent of reviled skin. Would he be pushing it if\u2026? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he worked one of his hands downward. He moved one of his fingers off her shirt, and onto her pale skin. It felt soft and warm. He did it again. She just lay there, eyes closed, enjoying the light rubbing. Then, he gently hooked his thumb under the shirt, scooted it up past her belly button, and began rubbing her bare skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie gave a little sigh. \u201cOh, that feels nice..\u201d Jesse\u2019s confidence surged. He moved the shirt up a little farther, massaging all the time, pressing a tad harder. He could literally feel the food and liquids being churned around by his fingers. He was in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Leslies belly let out a mighty gurgle, which Jesse felt beneath his fingers. He paused, and looked at Leslies face. To his surprise, she was blushing. Suddenly, a different look came across her face. She put an uncertain hand on the top of her belly still covered by her shirt, and suddenly gave an enormous belch! Jesse could literally feel the gas escaping her tummy, as it suddenly softened considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. That feels a TON better!\u201d Leslie said, laughing. Jesse laughed along. He took his hands off her still large belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess my work is done,\u201d he said, trying not to sound sad about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Leslie nearly shouted. She blushed, and said sheepishly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stop\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse smiled, and Leslie closed her eyes. Jesse pulled her shirt to the top of her domed belly, and began rubbing again. It amazed him how it was both soft and firm, both pillow-like and hard at the same time. It amazed him how he could feel everything going on in there beneath his fingers, every gurgle and every churn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never felt this happy in his whole life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each time, Jesse brought more food for Leslie to eat as Leslie became more hungry each time. This was good especially for Jesse because every time the stuffing was over, he would give Leslie a belly rub, which made him feel really happy for the ffact that he had liked Leslie for a while. One morning, Jesse comes downstairs and sees a letter in his place at the table. He immediately opened it up to find it was an invitation to a pool party from a girl in his class named Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a lot of fun! It's been a while since I swam in a pool,\" Jesse said as he thought about the pool party. Quickly, he started to wonder if Leslie was invited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should call her. I need to know if she got invited,\" Jesse said while scrambling for the phone. He quickly dialed Leslie's number until she answered moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jesse. What's up?\" Leslie asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much. I was just wondering if Katie sent you the pool party invite,\" Jesse asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I have it right here. Are you going?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'll go as long as you do,\" Jesse said, hoping that Leslie would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going then. But I am a little nervous,\" Leslie admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" Jesse asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since I've gained weight, I don't know how different I will look in a bikini. I just hope mine fits!\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse immediately felt turned on at the idea of seeing a fatter Leslie in a skinny bikini. He really was starting to get excited for the pool party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Leslie. It will all be fine. It says on the invitation that the party's tomorrow,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! That's quick. Jesse, I got to go and make sure I'll be ready for it. I'll see you later!\" Leslie said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Goodbye!\" Jesse said as they both hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Jesse was sure about was that he couldn't wait for the next day to see Leslie's fatter body in a bikini.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jesse stood in front of Leslie's house as the doorbell rang. By now, he was really excited to see Leslie in a bikini. The door opened a few seconds afterwards. Leslie opened with a bowl of chips in her hand. She wore a green top an hot pants. Her belly already looked stuffed as it strained the fabric of the pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me another minute,\" she said with her mouth full of chips, making Jesse wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She looks really stuffed. I wonder if she would have eaten so much if she would have known that I'm planning to feed her even more at the party, </i>Jesse thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie came back a few minutes afterwards. The bowl of chips was gone.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" she said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" replied Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her hand and they both went down the road to Katie's place. As they were walking, the boy couldn't help but put his arm around Leslie's hips. Jesse noticed that she even had a small muffin top now and was really turned on by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they arrived at Katie's place. They went right into the garden because they already heard the voices of a few of their friends. They stood at a small, white fence. Behind it was a big garden with a swimming pool in it. There were three girls and four boys in the garden, some already swimming in the pool while others just sat around and talked. Leslie also noticed that there was a big buffet on the left side of the pool. Jesse looked at her as she smiled in amazement, even though she must have been quite stuffed already. One of the girls, who was quite slim with long, brown, curly hair and eyes as brown as her hair, stood up and walked towards the couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Katie,\" Jesse said, giving the girl a quick hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie just shook the girls hand because she didn't want her to notice how bloated she was, even though you could already see it a little through the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's it going?\" asked Katie. \"I heard you were in hospital, Leslie. But since you're here again, you must be better,\" Katie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie nodded, and once again told the story how she had fallen off the rope. After they had talked a little, Katie went off to some of her other guests again. Leslie looked over to the buffet and Jesse smiled as he saw it. Without even taking notice of the pool, and ignoring how stuffed she already was from the chips, she helped herself to a plate of chips and chicken wings. The boy wondered if the once tiny girl would really manage to eat the mountain of food she put on her plate. There were ten chicken wings on it and a lot of french fries, which made Jesse have to help her keep the plate in balance so that the food would not fall off. Everyone who saw Leslie with the huge mountain of food looked shocked because they remembered her as a fit and sportive girl who had been one of the quickest runners in class. They were even more shocked when they saw her stuffing on all the food alone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie kept on eating, even though her belly was already stuffed. She wanted to get a bigger belly for Jesse. </span></div></div>",

She couldn't stop eating as if she was hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse...\" Leslie whined, but Jesse was too focusing his mind to notice her call. He let out a sigh of admiration, keeping his eyes off Leslie's belly that looks like she swallowed a beachball. <i>\"Jesse!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped out of state of trance. \"Wh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hold this plate; I need to use my left hand to rub my belly.

She struggled pulling and pulling with only little success. \"I don't know if I should be happy or sad about that\", Leslie thought. Pulling again and gain the trousers finally slipped over her now slightly bigger butt. Buttoning them was not really much better as the slight bulge she still had from the sutffing yesterday  made that a bit difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie had gained ten pounds only in the last week. It had felt like she had never been not stuffed all that time. From time to time it was a little painfull but it was totally worth it for the looks and especially the massages she got from Jesse. A thing she liked was that she just yesterday went getting a bra, because she was getting boobs. Leslie took on a blue tight shirt. It didn't really show anything, except for a little muffintop but it was really tight and she hoped Jesse would see every pound that was new on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took a shower and went down for breakfast. Her parents weren't there as they had already gone to work and so she just ate what she wanted. This resulted in being stuffed again. When Jesse arrived she opened the door, her pants unbuttoned and her shirt pushed up so he could see her already overstuffed little tummy. Jesse stould there in the door, his mouth open in amazement. \"Wow! I mean Leslie you look great\", he said starring at her. \"Thanks\", she replied smiling. \"So, where did you plan on going today?\", she asked.  </span></div></div>",

He walked to his house and noticed it was five o'clock. He went back into his house and packed his toothbrush, blankets, pillows, pajamas, and some food. Soon after, he walked downstairs and got ready to go. He put on a black beanie with a ball on top to keep warm and also put on his shoes, sweatshirt, and gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Leslie was in her house practically packing the same items. She kept on thinking how fun of an evening this would be. But one thing was on her mind: Her love for Jesse. She decided that she was going to tell him tonight how she felt. She went into the bathroom and started to put herself together by doing her hair and putting on some makeup, trying to make herself look cute.

Even her hat. Gosh it looks so hot on her. And even her jacket. Gosh she is so pretty!\" Jesse thought to himself. What he didn't realize was that Leslie was thinking the same stuff and she always had. It was cute since they both matched in a way. They had the same hats, but different colors. They both wore a white jacket/sweatshirt, and they both couldn't stop looking at eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..\" Leslie said, breaking the silence. \"You ready to camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you are,\" Jesse said, smiling back at Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith smiles on their faces, they both began walking and talking.

The two walked for a little bit, talking about Terabithia, school, and their lives at home. As they kept on walking, they both arrived at the treehouse, both looking up at their slumber place for the night. It was at this point Leslie decided to try and tell Jesse how she really felt about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jesse.... I got something... I really need to tell you,\" Leslie said to Jesse. They both stopped, looking in eachother's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Leslie?\" Jesse asked, hoping it was what he thought it was. Right after Jesse said this, Leslie dropped her thing as they crunched on top of the snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to catch me to find out!\" Leslie said, smiling as she began to run away from Jesse. Jesse immediately dropped his stuff and tried to catch her. Leslie ran all over the place as Jesse followed right behind her. Although Leslie was fast, Jesse was faster, which was suprising to Jesse since Leslie was usually faster than him. After a while of running, Leslie went by her stuff, picked it up, and began to climb the ladder into the treehouse. Jesse followed, grabbing his stuff as they climbed up to the treehouse. Leslie entered into the treehouse, knowing that Jesse would catch her now. Finally, Jesse appeared and tackled her to the ground. As he brought her down, he noticed something: Leslie had gained some weight. He couldn't really tell with her jacket and clothes on, but he could feel it. Now, Jesse's hands were next to both sides of Leslie's head as he was on top of her. They both felt very heated in their winter clothes, but didn't mind their positions right now. All they were doing was looking at eachother when Leslie....</span></div></div>",

She then got one of her hands and put it on the back of his head although his hat was in the way. She grabbed on and put her face closer to Jesse's. Then out of the blue, Leslie started to make out with Jesse. All Jesse could do was allow her to make out with him. He could feel fireworks exploding inside of him. Leslie was also feeling th same. By this time, both Leslie and Jesse were both lying on their sides, making out next to eachother, cherishing the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse.... I love you! From the moment I met you, I just... wanted... to be... with you!\" Leslie said with short breath from the making out. After she said that, Jesse grabbed the back of her head, although some of her hat was obviously in the way also, and continued to make out with Leslie. Jesse was feeling really turned on by Leslie. Leslie was smiling more and more as she felt Jesse's boner press up against her. After a couple minutes of making out, Jesse backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie... you do not know how long I have wanted to do that. I love you too!\" Jesse said, leading them to continue to make out. The two kept on makng out with eachother, both wanting to push this farther.

Jesse also did and the next moment they pushed their mouths together. Jess tongue traveled a second past Leslie's teeth before entering her mouth. He enjoyed it when it suddenly stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... did.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly his hand traveled under Leslie's sweater. Slowly going higher feeling her breasts and bra. His other went up the other way trying to pull the sweater of. Leslie lifted her arms so it was easier. slowly the sweater slid of. He slowly took the T-shirt under it and slowly pulled it up too reveling Leslie's chest and belly that was a bit bigger then before. He grabbed a boob and a portion of her bigger belly, making her let out a little moan of pleasure... Not that he ever had seen this much of Leslie. A cold breeze gave Leslie some goosebumps but that did't stop either of them. Lessie grabbed Jesse's sweater and pulled it of. Jesse also helped her with it. Leslie noticed that Jesse was getting a little fat. He had a pot belly and a pair of moobs plus other fat features<br>\r\n Leslie liked this. After his T-shirt also went of they both grabbed the other around their shoulders. Sitting on their knees pushing their upper body against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse. I wanted to have sex with you. I... never have done it before.

Leslie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry i don't know how those... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. Let me help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her bra slid of. Leslie now only wore her panties and Jesse only his underpants. They hugged each other while the kissed again. <br>\r\nJesse slowly grabbed her undies left and right and slowly pulled them down. Leslie did the same by him. Both looked at the other but no one felt ashamed being naked with the other.<br>\r\nLeslie went lying on the floor looking tempting at Jesse. He crawled on top of her and the kissed again. <br>\r\nBoth closed their eyes for the first few seconds when they made love. Leslie made a sound that was half pain and half pleasure. Both felt very  happy. Feeling how their spirits became one. Both made sounds of pleasure when Jesse cumed. Then it was over. Jesse rolled off her.<br>\r\nBoth were breathing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was that?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was wonderful. Better then I could have ever imagine.

Although Leslie was still asleep, Jesse turned to Leslie, who still had her eyes clothes. He then started to kiss her again, which made her wake up. Although this woke her up, she kissed along with him. As this happened, Jesse moved his body closer to Leslie and repeated the process that the two had done before.

Before Jesse met Leslie Jesse never thought he would ever meet a girl that he would have sex with. When he would get older he would't be one of those who still never had sex.<br>\r\nBoth hang out a lot together fantasizing about adventures in Terabithia. Although it was still winter, they were still having fun. <br>\r\nEverything was all right until after one month. It was Saturday.

Fine i guess. For now.\" She said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look kind of sad. Did something happened. Did i do something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this has nothing to do with you.

From me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else. You're the only person I had sex with. It was great don't understand me wrong but maybe I'm pregnant. I'm not ready to become a parent yet. Neither are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But you're not sure you pregnant. We can buy such a pregnancy test. You know. I mean we need to find out If you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know. But what if I am? What do we do then?\" Leslie asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we don't have to worry about that.\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth got up and started to walk to the village. Leslie was pretty nervous what normally was't like her. She was normally very calm. <br>\r\nThey went to a chemist's. Both had some money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh we would like one pregnancy test.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed the look in the old men eyes that he was't happy that he and Leslie did have sex at their age but he ignored it. He did't had anything to do with it. He paid for the pregnancy test and fast walked out before anyone else could see what they bought. No one else needed to know the two of them had sex. But if Leslie was pregnant her parents needed to know it. That was sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie if you are pregnant... what then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you keep it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I must admit i always wanted kids. But at the other hand we're both to young to raise a kid. But then again what's inside me is alive. Or it's gonna be something that's alive. Taking it away would feel a bit like murdering it. So I really don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home both went up to Leslie's bathroom. Jesse read the instructions.

Now that Leslie's secret was out to Jesse, he'd been doing everything in his power to gain more and more weight. Eating extra big breakfasts and dinners, buying two giant school lunches and packing an extra one full of fatty foods for in between classes, not exercising as hard, and eventually quitting P.E. since it was an extra-curricular activity. Jesse even went out with Leslie to the treehouse in the winter cold all bundled up and the two would spend the nights stuffing each other with food and loving each other. Over the weeks, as Leslie's bump had grown a little bit bigger, he had also begun to grow a lot as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few days, he had been eating way more than usual, and had finally reached the 250 lb mark. Leslie, of course, had loved him a lot more for that, but had practically begged him to grow even bigger. So, Jesse resorted to dropping out of school, which was not to his parent's liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, you are just willing to throw your future away for this?\" Jesse's Dad screamed at Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my future! Let me do what I want with it! I'm sorry that I can't grow up to be like you. You need to accept that this is who I am and this is what I am going to do! I will find a job and things will be okay for me. So leave me be!\" Jesse said as he walked his fat self up to his room to cry and eat. Jesse's Dad shook his head in disbelief and let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days, Jesse found a job as an online relationship matcher. This didn't require much knowledge and required him to not do much physical activity, which was the most important thing if he planned on growing a lot. Along with this, Jesse got his licence. Everyday before and after work, Jesse would go to the fatty fast food restaurants in town and just pig out on everything. His parents didn't really care since they knew that they couldn't change Jesse's future anymore and his work boss practically made sure he kept growing and eating, as if it was required as part of his job description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse loved his new life in so many ways. He liked coming home everyday to his parents who loved him dearly. Although they couldn't change his future, they encouraged him in eating more and more. Jesse would steal away at night to Leslie's house to see where they both had grown fatter and to love each other wildly as their fat made them grow more in love with each other. One night, after having insanely wild love-making, Leslie tells Jesse that she has to go in to the doctor's for a sonogram to find out what sex the baby's going to be and to find out why her stomach was still growing every week, making her slightly bigger than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" Jesse said after Leslie told him, kissing her on her fat body parts. \"Everything will be fine. I'm sure the baby's perfectly healthy,\" Jesse said, making Leslie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok. You're right. I'm sure it's going to be fine,\" she said, returning the favor and licking Jesse's fat body parts.</span></div></div>",

This is so wrong. I knew I should have used the pill, but I kept gaining when I did that. So I stopped. Besides, I didn't have a boyfriend back then, so I never thought it was necessary,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we need to tell my parents. I mean, they're going to find it out sooner or later if my belly get's bigger. Sure, I could say I gained some weight, but if I'm eight months pregnant, they're not going to believe I only gained some weight. I don't think I can get an abortion at my age. Not without permission of my mother. Besides, one side of me is also a little happy. I always wanted a child. Just... not now,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you do get a child, I will help you.

Oh, I hope they're not angry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like you said, you need to tell them anyway. Better sooner than later. I think they're only more angry if you keep it a secret.

You said you had a fun time. You two held hands when you came back. So cute. Just like your father and me when we were your age,\" Leslie's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we did have a fun time that night.\" Leslie said. \"Mom, Dad... that night in the tree house... well Jesse and I had... well... sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth waited a bit scared, wondering how her parents would react. Shocked, angry or furious. But they stayed pretty calm while they looked at the two children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry too much about it. We two also did some crazy things when we were your age. All right, we didn't have sex at that age. You two are a bit young, but hey, we can't really stop you. Lots of kids do it these days at very young ages!\"       <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Besides, we know Jesse is a good boy and we know he would never harm you in any way!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Like if I could,\" Jesse mumbled.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Eh Mom, Dad, apparently more happened that night than we thought. We just checked it and... well I'm pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth waited to see how Leslie's parents would react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the beginning of a winter morning at the Aaron's household. May Belle was getting herself up and out of her bed. May Belle is Jesse's younger sister. She always had looked up to Jesse, but things were starting to shift. Now that Jesse had met Leslie, he was starting to become more mean to May Belle by snapping at her very quickly, excluding her from hanging out with him and Leslie, and even starting to make fun of her. Of course, since May Belle was younger, this did hurt her feelings. May Belle felt like she had no one else to rely on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that was starting to help May Belle out with the bullying issue was food. For some reason, she felt the more she ate, the more comforting the food was. It didn't even matter what kind of food it was. It only mattered as long as it was close by. None of her family really noticed that she was eating bigger portions than normal unless they were all eating together, but even then, they didn't seem surprised by it. That and the fact that it was winter didn't help May Belle either since it meant that she would stay inside more, lounge around and not be as active. Because of all this, May Belle had some extra weight on her. She looked fine since she was younger, but she still needs to watch it. She has a small outer belly with some extra flab around her arms, chin, legs, and butt. If anything, she looked like she had gained a few pounds. But even she didn't notice this yet as she got out of bed and continued on with a normal day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle slid on a long sleeve white shirt and put a dress over it. She then headed to the bathroom and prepared herself. It was then that she run into Jesse as she left the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you actually went fast this morning. Otherwise I would just have to throw you out,\" Jesse said to May Belle with a chuckle. Although this upset May Belle, she brushed it off and went downstairs to eat. She went into the cupboards and grabbed some cereal, poured it into a big bowl and added milk. She quickly ate the cereal within minutes, realizing she still had time. It was then that May Belle decided to sneak a treat before school. May Belle went back into the cupboard, grabbed a container of Oreos and snuck up to her room without being spotted. She then started to eat all of the Oreos one by one, enjoying the taste of the sugar in her mouth. Oreos were definitely her favorite snack food. After noticing the container was empty, she felt full. She then headed back downstairs to see Jesse putting his winter hat on along with his other snow stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, shrimp. The bus will be here any minute!\" Jesse yelled to her as he went out the door. May Belle then hurried to get ready. She went into the refrigerator and grabbed her lunch. As she looked in it, she put more snack food into the bag, knowing that she would be more hungry later. She put her lunch into her backpack, put on her brown jacket, her brown boots, her winter hat with a big puff ball on top, and then walked outside, wondering what crap Jesse would give her on the bus.</span></div></div>",

Leslie was wearing a white winter jacket, a white puff ball hat with tassels, matching boots and gloves, and a smile in between her blonde hair. Jesse was very attracted to her, but never said anything to her about that yet. May Belle could easily see this, but also didn't say anything. Like usual, May Belle sat in the seat in front of them, trying to avoid Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus then started to move as they headed towards school. Jesse and Leslie started to talk to each other while May Belle slouched in her seat. She started to rub her belly, noticing that she was a little more hungrier, even though she had eaten a lot before. Quietly, May Belle opened up her backpack, pulled out her lunch bag, and pulled out some food. May Belle started to eat some of her snack food (more Oreos in particular) and smiled in bliss as she satisfied her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things come to an end.</span></div></div>",

Didn't you eat enough at home?\" Jesse said, noticing his sister eating more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle swallowed the food in her mouth, which was hard since she wasn't done chewing yet and looked at her brother with big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not,\" She mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep eating like that, you're going to look just like a little piggy. You look a lot like a piggy already, you know. That nose and ears of yours,\" Jesse said to May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle turned away her head. Her eyes were burning, but she didn't want her brother to see her cry. <br>\r\nJesse suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder who pulled him back. It was Leslie, who looked at him with some sort of disapproval look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you need to be a bit nicer to her, Jesse. After all, she's your sister,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? My other sisters weren't that nice to me either,\" Jesse mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? That's not really a good reason to not be nice to your sister. You know you should be glad you have sisters. I would have given my right arm for a brother or a sister. Do you know how boring it is to grow up alone? I had my parents, of course, but never a real playmate of my own age. I'm glad I have you now,\" She said with a smile, grabbing Jesse's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie's words cheered May Belle up a bit, but she doubted if Jesse really would stop being mean to her. But he would probably leave her alone until they were at school. She pushed a last handful of food in her mouth and decided to save the rest for later. She slowly rubbed her belly and must admit that it did feel a bit bigger, but she didn't put that many attention towards it. After all, she was a growing girl. That's what some relatives told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess and Leslie were busy talking about some strange animals. She didn't really put that much attention to them. <br>\r\nMay Belle had mixed feelings about Leslie. She must admit Leslie always had been nice to her, but since Jesse hung around with her, he spent less time with her and was a lot meaner to her. However, that wasn't Leslie's fault, but still, she didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the bus arrived at school. She waited a bit until Jesse got out before she moved to the exit. <br>\r\nShe noticed that she still was a bit hungry, but she knew she needed to wait until recess since the teacher wouldn't allow her to eat during class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Leslie and Jesse walking to their class together and also walked into school.     </span></div></div>",

Everything her teacher was teaching didn't get her attention at all. All she wanted to do was go to her back pack and grab her food. Finally, after a few hours of learning, the lunch bell rang out loud. May Belle got up out of her seat and grabbed her lunch, happy that she could eat her food. Instead of eating in the lunch room, May Belle decided to eat in the bathroom so she could eat in peace away from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle savored the taste of her lunch, filling her up quickly with all of the extra food she had packed. May Belle ate her sandwich along with some fruit roll ups, candy and other treats that would be considered an unhealthy lunch. She never knew she could eat that much food in one sitting, making her very satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for the Oreo's,\" May Belle said as she opened up the stall. A moment later, another bell rang. This was the bell for recess. This made May Belle feel sort of sad since she wished she had more time inside. It was snowing outside and she really hated feeling cold. On top of that, she wanted to eat more food. which meant she would have to sneak herself away from people so they would not notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I need to try my best to get the food past everyone,\" May Belle said as she headed for the back pack room for her class. There were a lot of kids in the room, all getting ready to go outside and play for recess. May Belle put on her hat, gloves, and started to put on her jacket. As kids left the room, leaving her alone, May Belle stuck the package of the remaining Oreos into her jacket, zipped it up, and put her arms around her waist, trying to hold up the pack of Oreo's, but she realized she was sort of grabbing her newer forming belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen May Belle arrived outside, she saw all of the other kids running around and enjoying the snow. She quietly snuck away to the side of the school where the snow was melted away, making it possible to sit down and enjoy her Oreos. This made May Belle smile, wanting to enjoy her food in peace. She took off her gloves, placed her hat farther down on her head and started to dig into the remainder of her Oreos. The taste made her smile with pleasure, wanting to eat more and more. She just wanted to enjoy the food in peace.</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't have been such a problem if it wouldn't have been Janice Avery, the school bully. Every kid knew she was mean and most kids were wise enough to avoid her as much as possible. But the chubby little child wasn't paying attention to anything except eating the Oreos. She noticed someone was standing behind her when it was too late. She swallowed the remaining food in her mouth, turned around and looked up at the evil face of Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(gulp) Eh, hello Janice. Nice... eh nice weather today, right?\" May Belle said sweating a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate snow. Much too cold,\" Janice said and looked mean at May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I hate it, too. Stupid snow. Very cold,\" Slowly she took a few steps back. \"Now I think I must be go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have there?\" Janice asked and looked at the box of Oreos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Really nothing,\" May Belle said, trying to hide the box behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice grinned evilly and bent over to her. May Belle didn't wait and turned around, wanting to run away. But Janice grabbed her coat, held her and grabbed the box of Oreos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks. This will be pretty tasty. I didn't have breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait! Give them back. Those were mine,\" May Belle said in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. WERE yours. Now they're mine,\" She said and walked away while eating the Oreos, leaving May Belle behind crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jesse and Leslie were sitting on a bench a little away from the others in their own world of imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it is this cold, there's a good chance evil monsters come over. Normally, they live in places were it's cold like the top of a mountain. Now it's so cold down here so they probably will come down,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if they do, we at least have a weapon we can use to fight them,\" Jesse said when he made a snow ball and threw it against a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can use your new weapon, but we still need to be very careful,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen May Belle walked over to them still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Belle, get lost! We're busy!\" Jesse said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong. Why are you crying?\" Leslie asked in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice took away my Oreos I was eating,\" She said between crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not so bad. I think you're getting pretty fat, sis. It's maybe better she took away your Oreos. Now you can't eat them so you will maybe lose some of the extra weight,\" Jesse said to his sister. This of course only caused May Belle to cry harder. She ran away with a jiggling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't need to do that. Jesse, be a bit more nice to her. She's your little sister and she looks up to you. You could be more nice to her or do stuff with her,\" Leslie said dissapointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's little. She looks up to everyone. And why am I the one who needs to hang out with my younger sister? Can't she hang out with Joyce Ann?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joyce Ann is only three years old!\" Leslie shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not. She's four,\" Jesse replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. What I mean is if someone looks up to you, you need to be nice to that person and lately, you're acting very mean to your sister,\" Leslie said to Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must admit I was partly telling the truth. She is getting pretty fat,\" Jesse said as he pointed to his belly, indicating May Belle's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but being a bit bigger isn't so bad, especially not for a little girl. But still, it wasn't nice of Janice to take away her Oreos. Someone should teach her a lesson,\" Leslie said.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle was standing in a corner of the playground crying.

As soon as she got in, she slammed the front door, opened up her cupboard, grabbed food and ran up to her room, locking the door behind her. She didn't even bother to take off any of her outdoor stuff. She then discovered that she had grabbed a bag of marshmallows, a container of Chips Ahoy cookies, and a bag of Lay's Potato Chips. Satisfied with what she grabbed, May Belle opened up the containers of food and started to eat. Mindlessly, she reached out, grabbed whatever she could and stuffed it down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was in her mindless haze, May Belle grew angry about how her day went. Jesse and Janice were constantly being mean to her and made fun of her size. May Belle knew that she wasn't obese, but she wasn't afraid to admit that she had gained a few pounds. She was starting to wonder if she should gain weight just to make her brother mad. But, then again, if she did, he would probably end up making fun of her until she went insane. She didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she was confident in was her eating. After a half hour straight of eating, all three containers of food were empty, leaving her to pat her belly in peace, liking the feeling of being stuffed. Suddenly, she started to cry, feeling emotionally distraught. To stop herself from having the tears continue, she headed back downstairs to get more comfort food.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, she got out of bed and took some clothes. When she took out her pajamas, she paused a minute to look at her body and noticed she really did gain a few pounds. Well, in all honesty, she gained more than a few. It was obvious she gained weight. She remembered that yesterday, even after all that comfort food, she still ate a lot at dinner. She ate even more than her older sisters, but nobody seemed to notice. Even if they did, they didn't say anything. Not even Jesse said anything to May Belle, but he seemed to be lost in thoughts. He would just look in the air sometimes, looking in the direction of Leslie's house or in the direction of the forest they went in every day after school. If anything, May Belle had come to a realization: She really was making a pig out of of her little self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she put on her clothes, she must admit they were awfully tight. For a moment, she hoped mom maybe washed them too hot, but she also knew that that probably wasn't the right answer. She decided to do downstairs and eat something before the rest of the family woke up. Slowly on bare feet, she walked down the stairs. She knew exactly which stairs squeaked. She stepped over those ones. After a few minutes, she was downstairs. Her tummy rumbled while she slowly patted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You'll be fed soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the kitchen and looked in the cupboard and frowned. She only saw one bag of chips and further only pasta and canned food. She was a bit disappointed, but thought again about yesterday and remembered she was the one who ate everything from the cupboard. <br>\r\nThe next moment, she ripped open the bag and started to cram the chips in her mouth with both hands. She worked like a machine with one hand in the bag. While that hand pushed the food in her mouth, the other was in the bag getting more food. She just wanted the food in her belly. It didn't take long for her to finish the bag. She belched loudly and leaned against the refrigerator. She was still hungry. Then it hit her. There must be food in the refrigerator. She opened it and looked inside until she found a big roast. It was a big roast since her mother planned it for dinner and with a family of seven, you need to have a big roast. The little girl wasn't thinking clearly right now. All she wanted was food and this was food. The thought that her mother wanted to use it didn't come up in her head at the moment. The next moment, she buried her head in the roast and started to eat like a starved animal. She knew she made a pig out of herself yesterday, but now she was eating like a real pig. She ripped pieces of meat off the roast just like a wolf and chewed loudly with a wide open mouth. She didn't stop eating until the whole roast was in her belly. Her whole face was sticky from the roast. The little girl had finished an entire roast meant for seven people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to slowly rub her round belly.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After realizing this, May Belle went back into her refrigerator and started to look for more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly enough, May Belle found leftovers from the other night in containers just waiting to be eaten. The leftovers included meat and pasta mixed, chicken, beans, and even stuffing. Quietly, May Belle warmed the leftovers up in the microwave while licking her lips, tasting the aftermath of her roast feast. When the timer went off, May Belle grabbed the containers of food and set them on the table. May Belle didn't care about table manners as she grabbed food with her hands out of different containers and stuffed the food into her mouth. She let out moans of pleasure as she kept on stuffing the food down her gullet, acting like more of a pig in the process. She even got to the point where she grabbed one of the bins of leftovers, shoved her fatter face into it and started to scarf down the food. She was quickly acting more like a slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said and done, May Belle had eaten her fair share of food, burping and moaning from the ecstacy of her self stuffing. Deep down, she wanted to eat until she ripped off all of her clothes, but she knew that she needed to take a break from the eating. Qucikly and quietly, May Belle cleaned up her meal, leaving no evidence of the stuffing even happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking about it, May Belle knew that she should go and clean herself up. She didn't even have to look at her face to know it was covered in sauces from the food. That and May Belle wanted to examine her weight up close.</span></div></div>",

Part of the evidence was still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I need to clean myself up,\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that her family would find out anyway since all the food was gone didn't came up in the young girl's mind. She decided to also change into some other clothes since the clothes on her were awfully tight. She slowly grabbed another dress and waddled into the bathroom. The rest of the family was still asleep. She hoped that they would stay asleep.  <br>\r\nShe took off her clothes as they were cutting into her soft flesh. After that, she looked over at herself. To be honest, she liked her fatter form. It did look good on her frame as her belly hung lower with ripples. Why shouldn't she try to become fat? Because Jesse would tease her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. That would make a big difference,\" She said to herself in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse would tease her anyway. If she weighed 80 or 800 pounds, he would tease her anyway. He was also teasing her because she was fatter. Well she would show him what fat really was. She would become fat! She tried to image what she would look like if she was fatter. She liked the idea about the whole situation.<br>\r\nShe went into the shower and turned the hot water on. The water was running over her fat body, slowly washing away the sauce from her face. She decided now that she was busy washing herself, she might as well wash her entire body and soap herself down. When she soaped her belly, she giggled, feeling how big and round her belly was. It was also pretty hard because of all the food in it. She soaped her belly another time just because she liked the feeling. <br>\r\nAfter she cleaned herself and rubbed herself dry, she found out that her new clothes were just as tight as her old ones.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I need bigger clothes. Especially if I keep gaining weight, I soon will need bigger clothes, \" May Belle said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew her parents wouldn't be happy with that. Clothes these days were very expansive. Besides, her parents would probably take some old clothes from Jesse, which were clothes that he got from Ellie and Brenda, which were then clothes that would be worn by Joyce Ann if they weren't ripped. <br>\r\nMay Belle hated that she was the second youngest of the family. She always got things from her older sisters or her older brother. Well, it was even worse for Jesse since the stuff he got were made for girls like the shoes he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky Leslie. She's an only child and her parents are rich. She can get new stuff whenever she wants. She doesn't have any younger sister or brother she has to give her clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in the middle of her sentence. Maybe Leslie had some old clothes left that she could have. Then it would take more time before her parents would notice her weight gain. May Belle's parents most of the time were so busy that they would hardly notice her weight gain. There was just too much to do for them to notice their second youngest child gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked downstairs and used to opportunity to watch some television.</span></div></div>",

She was getting annoyed with the tightness of the dress that she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take this. I need to find some new clothes. Maybe I should visit Leslie,\" May Belle said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed over to the door, put on her hat, gloves, boots, and jacket. As she put on the jacket, she noticed it was a little bit tighter on her, making her start to resemble a tan marshmellow. At this point, she was hoping that Leslie would have a jacket that she could have, too. Quietly, May Belle opened the door and started to walk over to Leslie's house. The moment she stepped out, she felt the crunching of the snow under her feet. With every step, May Belle was getting more nervous. In all honesty, she was depending on Leslie. If she didn't have any clothes, she didn't know what she would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, May Belle approached Leslie's front door. After taking a moment to breathe and calm down, May Belle knocked on the door. Within moments, Leslie came up to the door wearing her pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey, May Belle. What brings you over here so early?\" Leslie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leslie. I really need your help,\" May Belle said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well, what with?\" Leslie asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need to get some new clothing. My other clothing is getting smaller and I really don't want any other hand me downs. I mean, I would ask my parents, but clothes are really expensive and I don't know how much more I will grow. Do you have any clothes that I could have by any chance?\" May Belle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie knew that May Belle was talking about her weight, but she knew that May Belle didn't want Leslie to notice. She felt bad for May Belle, which wanted to help her even more, especially since Jesse had been picking on her more and more lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, May Belle. I have a lot of clothes. I was actually thinking about getting rid of some of them anyway! What kind of clothes do you need?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need some new shirts and jeans for sure. If it is possible, I need a new jacket. This one is getting tighter on me,\" May Belle said with a frown. With that, Leslie couldn't say no to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Sounds good! And I can give you a jacket! I actually got some matching hats and gloves to go with it! Come inside!\" Leslie said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle started to smile, happy that Leslie could help her. She even offered to give her new winter clothing. At this point, May Belle was looking forward to getting her new clothes from Leslie. </span></div></div>",

It was a lot bigger than her own room and had a lot more toys and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all fom you?\" She asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I never had a brother or sister. Because of that, my parents bought all kinds of stuff for me so I could keep myself occupied. But believe me, it's not fun being an only kid,\" Leslie said somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie walked to her closet and opened it. There were a lot of clothes, but May Belle noticed that there were hardly any dresses. Now that she thought about it, she remembered she never saw Leslie wearing a dress except for that one time she went to church with them. Leslie looked deep in her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I knew it. Here are two old shirts and some sports clothing. You can have it. I've outgrown it. Now where did I put that jacket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in her closet again while May Belle tried on the clothes. They fitted fine, but were a bit long. She discovered if she turned the pipes and sleeves a few times, they would be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it. Where did I put those things... wait a sec. Come,\" Leslie said to May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie walked to the hall and took a long stick with a hook at the end. Then, May Belle saw a hatch in the roof with a ring sticking out of it. Leslie got the hook through the ring and pulled the hatch down. At the inside of the hatch was a big staircase. Leslie pulled a lever and slowly, the stairs slid down.<br>\r\nLeslie listened if her parents had awakened at all by the sound, but she still heard the snoring of her Dad and the soft breathing of her mother.<br>\r\nLeslie took a flashlight and climbed the stairs. Upstairs, she looked around with her flashlight. May Belle followed her. Upstairs was full of boxes. It seemed to be some sort of storage room. On each box was written what was in it like old records, shoes, camping stuff, magazines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Here it is!\" Leslie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a big box out. On the side was written old clothes. Together with May Belle, she took the box down and to her room. Leslie opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. Where is that jacket? Oh! Here it is! Complete with hat and gloves,\" Leslie said and pulled them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle smiled. It was pink and purple. Her two favorite colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I really have them?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Go ahead. I don't wear them anymore. I've outgrown them. Besides, my Mom was planning to give them away anyway to charity or sell them at a market. So go ahead. Take them. At least then I'll know somebody is using them. Take all you want,\" Leslie said with a grin. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nMay Belle curiously looked at all the clothes and pulled out the few she liked and finally had three shirts, three pants, two sweaters, one dress and some sport outfits. She knew Leslie was the fastest runner from her brother's class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It that all you need?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now it is,\" May Belle said with a smile and hugged Leslie. \"Thank you so much for the clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, really. How's Jesse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess. But he's so mean to me lately. I really like you, but since he hangs out with you, he seems to have less time for me,\" May Belle said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for that. If you see him, tell him I'd like to see him. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. See you later, Leslie,\" May Belle said as she put on her jacket and hat, picked up the boxes and left. Happy with her new clothes, she ran back home. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everytime we ask for new clothes, we get turned down by Mom and Dad,\" Brenda said in a bratty attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she had clothes that were too small for her. You guys wouldn't have been able to get the clothes at this size,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we're not getting bigger,\" Ellie said to Brenda, which May Belle heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem with getting bigger?\" May Belle asked, kind of irritated with her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fat is looked upon as ugly and disgusting,\" Brenda said to her sister while Ellie agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like being bigger whether you both do or not,\" May Belle said as she walked upstairs, ending the conversation. Her sisters were shocked, but chose to let her be for the moment. As May Belle went into her room, she closed the door and placed the box on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I am happy,\" May Belle said with a grin as she layed out the clothes on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle took off her tight jacket, hat and gloves and placed them down on her bed. She looked at her dress to notice that it was even tighter than before. May Belle looked at her new clothes, noticing they were all cute but different styles each. She decided to look at the sports outfits. One of them was a basketball jersey with shorts while the others were stretchy clothing that was colorful. May Belle put the stretchy clothing on, noticing that her belly stretched out with the stretchy clothing, which she thought looked great. The outfit did a great job of showing her fatter features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued, she looked at the jacket that was pink and purple. She then put it on and looked at the hat and gloves. She noticed that hat was purple and blue with a pink puff ball on top and tassels with puffs on them. She put it on and looked in the mirror. She thought that she looked very cute, liking her new clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great! I got to tell Leslie to let me know when she grows out of more stuff,\" May Belle said as she started to pose in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

But you're grounded for two days and also no dessert for you for two days,\" May Belle's dad summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle nodded. She didn't want to push her luck.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As May Belle headed up to her room, she became sad at the idea of being grounded. She didn't have any plans for the week, but still, having restrictions was a pain overall. On the plus side, at least she was only grounded for two days. She sat on her bed, took off her jacket and started to think about what to do with her time. Suddenly, it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candy!\" May Belle said as she ran to her closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, May Belle opened up the closet and looked around. After minutes of searching, May Belle pulled out a pillow case that looked stuffed and heavy. She opened up the pillow case and found a large stash of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Halloween just passed! Thank goodness I got a lot of candy this year!\" May Belle said as she started to eat her candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started eating the candy with speed, but then realized that she needed to make the candy last for two days, maybe even more since she liked to eat candy. Piece by piece, May Belle kept on eating. Within a half hour, she noticed the pile of wrappers that were next to her. After seeing this, she threw away the wrappers, trying to dispose of the evidence. If her parents found out that she was eating food, especially candy, she didn't know what they would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle looked up, seeing that she was looking in her full body mirror. She noticed that her stretchy clothing felt some what tighter as her food was slowly digesting and turning into fat. She liked the way the clothing hugged her body, bringing out prominent points with her fat. All she wanted to do was get fatter. Before she kept on eating more candy, May Belle suddenly felt chilly from the cold winter air outside her window. She put on her hat and jacket and lied down on her bed, sticking her hand into her candy pile and continuing to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two days should go by fast!\"</span></div></div>",

I know. Believe me. A troll who's hunting never loses a scent. They keep coming until they're done. But one good thing is that they're not so smart,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most trolls aren't smart,\" Jesse said with his arms over one another. \"Besides, I heard you gave my sister some of your clothes,\" Jesse started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. That doesn't matter. It was old clothes of mine. I've outgrown them anyway. I can't wear them anymore. Besides, my Mom will throw them away or sell them. At least now I know someone is making good use of them. Good thing too since it was nice clothes and if she's outgrown them, Joyce Ann can wear them eventually,\" Leslie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse nodded. Every clothing piece first belonged to his sisters, which were Ellie and Brenda, then to him at times, then to May Belle and finally to Joyce Ann. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's true. But she's putting on a lot of weight lately. She's really getting fat. Do you know she managed to eat a big bag of chips, an entire roast for seven people and a ton of leftovers all by herself? Just this morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie whistled to show she was impressed, but didn't seem to really mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid has a healthy appetite. You know, Jesse, you should be a bit more nice to her. She's your little sister. Older kids need to protect the younger one. You know, I once knew a girl who had two kittens. Brother and sister and if they were on the street and saw another cat, the brother protected his sister. You should do that, too,\" Leslie commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Protect her? Leslie, we're not animals. She need to learn how to do things on her own. But now she's eating herself to obesidy. I'm worried about that,\" Jesse admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse... I think that's not any of your concern,\" Leslie mumbled. \"If she's happy with her size, nothing's wrong with that. The only ones who have something to say about that are your parents. It's not like she's morbidly obese,\" Leslie said in a convincing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but she will be if she keeps eating like that,\" Jesse replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe she's not happy with her size. I mean, I'm happy with my size,\" Leslie said as she put her hands to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course. You have a perfect size,\" Jesse smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect? Maybe. For you and me. We think my size is perfect, but May Belle may think her size isn't perfect and want to have a bigger size. If her weight gain is bothering you so much, you should talk to her about it. Perhaps that will solve your problem and at the same time, you'll be nice to her,\" Leslie said logically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, you are right,\" Jesse said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that? You haven't talked to her yet,\" Leslie snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean about the troll,\" Jesse replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie jumped aside just before the hand of the troll tried to grab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I asked for help from the pixies,\" Leslie grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those are smaller than my finger,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And impossible for him to grab,\" replied Leslie.</span></div></div>",

By this point, May Belle had drifted to sleep in all of her clothes she had on while a pile of candy wrappers laid next to her. She clenched her hands on her sedated belly as she started to dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle opened her eyes. She started to look around, seeing that she was in a room with four walls around her. She started to look at her hands, seeing that she was bound to a chair. She was still wearing the same clothes, but instead, she was very skinny, looking as if she hadn't eaten in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you need to put on some weight,\" a voice said, making May Belle look around. It sounded familiar to her, but she wondered who it was. Within moments, a figure came out of the darkness, approaching May Belle. Moments later, May Belle opened her mouth in surprise to see someone she would least expect in her dream: Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me?\" May Belle asked her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been naughty, May Belle. You've barely eaten anything and now you're underweight. I will make you put on so much weight, you won't be able to stand!\" Jesse said with a sinister grin. May Belle started feeling shocked, but then started to think about it. Her brother was making her fatter in her dream! To some, that would be a nightmare for any sibling. For May Belle, however, she thought of it as a sweet dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It won't take long,\" Jesse said as a tube came out from the ceiling. Quickly, it lunged itself into May Belle's mouth, forcing itself tightly into it. She looked to Jesse as a control panel appeared out of nowhere. Immediately, Jesse pulled a lever and pressed a button, which made a prominent flowing sound. Within moments, the liquid being released started to flow into May Belle's mouth, tasting like cotton candy. Because of that and the fact the liquid kept on running, May Belle swallowed the liquid as it came down. She got so used to it, she treated it as if she was sucking a bottle. She would suck and let the liquid move down her throat, breathe, and repeat. The process came along easily as she started to relax and drift off to sleep again. Slowly, but surely, May Belle was starting to fatten up. Her arms were filling up like bean bags being stuffed as her lower arm flab started to droop. Her cheeks were becoming more pig like as her cheeks started to puff out. Her chin became more prominent, but then started to form layer after layer, forming double chins and more. Her thighs started to fill to a pear shape, but then started to become more spherical. The worst thing affected on her was her stomach and her ass as it became larger and flabbier with more rolls. Along with this, her clothes were starting to expand and reach her limits. The only thing that was not being affected was her hat, but all of her other clothes were starting to rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse smiled as more tan skin started to appear on his younger sister, filling her out more and more. The problem for May Belle was that she was so sedated, as if she was asleep, that she wasn't noticing the affects on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>May Belle felt a pain and opened her eyes. She looked around her room and noticed she was on the floor. It seemed that she rolled so much in her sleep that she rolled straight out of bed. She slowly got up and noticed some more empty wrappers from her candy binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I need to clean those up before Mom and Dad see this,\" May Belle said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents didn't like them eating much candy and what she had eaten was in her parent's eyes as way too much. <br>\r\nShe then saw herself in the mirror and admired her new curves. Her big belly pushed against the fabric of her clothes just like her hips and butt while even some of her upper body started to fill out. She was gaining all over her body. She wondered if her parents would notice her gaining. Sure, her Dad did this morning, but his attention at that moment was with her. If she didn't do anything to draw her parent's attention, maybe nothing would happen. Her parents were already busy with their work to pay their bills and take care of Joyce Ann. Also, Jesse, Ellie, and Brenda also asked for their parent's attention now and then. If she didn't draw her parent's attention, they would probably be too occupied with the others to notice her gaining for at least some time until she would be a lot fatter.<br>\r\nShe yawned one time and stretched herself. She wondered what she would do. She thought about going outside for a moment, but remembered her parents grounded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit cold outside anyway,\" She said and rubbed her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what Jesse was doing. Before Leslie came, he mostly was drawing. But since she came, he ran away with her to a place that she didn't know where. All she knew was that they went into the forest. But did they stay in the forest? If they did, how far did they go in the forest? What was so special for those two? Or was the forest only a way to go to something else? Something much more exciting? Maybe something forbidden?<br>\r\nShe was getting very excited wondering what it could be. She got up and walked downstairs. There was no one there. There was no stupid chatting from Ellie and Brenda. Her parents, who were worried about how expensive something was, were also not there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all alone,\" She mumbled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her belly rumbled. She was hungry. She wanted food. <br>\r\nBut she knew if she started eating again, her parents wouldn't be too happy. <br>\r\nMaybe she could act like someone broke into their house who also raided the fridge. Maybe? No, of course not. Her parents would never fall for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm so hungry,\" She cried. \"I want some food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the cupboard and at the refrigerator, both full with delicious food, which were so close and so far away at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wasn't I born into a rich family that had so much food in house that it wouldn't matter if I took something? But no. I live in the poorest family in the entire town who would notice it if I would even eat a crumb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sat at the table, but the hunger kept nagging to her. She just wanted some food. Was that too much to ask for?</span></div></div>",

She took out a big bag of chips, a box of Oreo cookies, and grabbed some twinkies. When one looked into the cupboard, it didn't look like she took that much. However, it was still a lot for one to eat. As long as it wasn't an amount to make her parents notice, then she would be okay. She took the food up to her room, placed it on her bed, and closed the door. The next moment later, her stomach started to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat! I need more fat!\" May Belle said, triggering her into a mindless food coma. She laid down on her bed, tore open the bag of chips, and started to put the bag to her face, taking in a mouthful of chips. The salt and vinegar flavor satisfied her taste buds as she looked like she had chipmunk cheeks with all of the food in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the session, her mind blanked out as she stuffed herself without any thoughts. In bliss, she enjoyed the food high she was getting as her hands, mouth, and stomach did all of the thinking for her. The more the food went inside her, the more fat she was slowly getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time May Belle's mind was back into reality, she realized that all of the food she had was gone. The only thing remaining were the wrappers from her feast. At this point, May Belle looked in the mirror. She had a ton of food remains on her face, which triggered her to lick it all off of herself. Her belly was hard as it hung in front of her. Surprisingly, May Belle was less hungry, but not full. Now she had to decide what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think of her next move, she saw that Leslie and Jesse were walking back to their respective homes. Leslie quickly went into her house in her winter clothes, escaping the wrath of the cold weather. This gave May Belle an idea. What if she went to Leslie's house and asked her for food? Leslie was so nice to her, she could ask for food and possibly for more clothes. She would need to sneak around Jesse, but that wouldn't be an issue if she made it seem like she was not home. Besides, usually when Jesse came back, he would take a nap. That would make it easier to sneak over to Leslie's house. However, that could be a risky move. May Belle had to make up her mind.</span></div></div>",

However, there was a prominent bump in the curtain where her belly was and if Jesse would have looked at the curtain, he may have noticed it. Luckily, he walked straight to his room. Slowly, May Belle came out of her hiding spot.<br>\r\nShe put one foot outside, but then remembered her parents grounded her. On the other hand, what they don't know won't hurt her. The only ones who would know she was outside was her and Leslie and Leslie wouldn't tell on her. She didn't even know May Belle was grounded.<br>\r\nQuickly, she walked over to Leslie's house and knocked on the door. Leslie opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi, May Belle.\" Leslie said surprised. \"Why are you here? You didn't outgrow those clothes I gave you already, did you?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that. I was wondering if I can have some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie frowned. She didn't expect that question, but lifted her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We have more than enough food. Come in! The kitchen is this way,\" Leslie said as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle followed Leslie while looking around. Compared to her house, everything here was so tidy. At home, they mostly threw a lot of their stuff on the ground. With five kids, it was always a mess. Leslie walked straight to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! You can have a banana and in the meantime, I will make a big bowl of ice cream for you. I always liked making it, but my parents mostly don't have time for ice cream,\" She said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle started on her banana while she looked at Leslie, who started making a bowl of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Belle,\" Leslie suddenly said. \"I was with Jesse today and I heard that he was concerned about you. He said you ate a lot of food and gained a lot of weight,\" Leslie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse? Concerned? Are we talking about the same Jesse? He's always teasing me. He isn't nice at all,\" May Belle said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But that doesn't mean to say he's not concerned about you. Are you gaining a lot of weight?\" Leslie asked while she put some whipped cream on the huge ice cream scoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle thought for a moment and decided to tell Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell this to anyone, but I want to gain weight,\" May Belle whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I suspected something like that. So that's why you eat so much and why you needed new clothes,\" Leslie said logically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know why, but for some strange reason, my appetite increased a lot lately and now that I started gaining, I'm happy with it. That's why I now eat a lot and why I have gained more weight. That's also why I needed new clothes,\" May Belle explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle quickly started eating her huge ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, May Belle, If you really want to gain, I won't stop you and you can have clothes that I have outgrown. However, I have always used to be slender, so I'm not sure if they will fit you much more. And be careful. If you become too fat, it can become really unhealthy for you,\" Leslie said in a motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle listened carefully to what Leslie told her. </span></div></div>",

You promised not to tell anyone!\" May Belle screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, May. I won't tell anyone, but I think you should tell some people. I mean, they're going to find out sooner or later. If you gain so much weight that your clothes don't fit anymore, after that, your chairs will break. Also, after that, you get trouble with the smallest effort of exercise, after that needing two chairs to sit on. Then after that, you can't reach the buttons on the computer. Then after that, you become so fat that you can't fit through the door. Finally, after that, you become so fat that you can't walk and finally you do noting but lay in bed all day eating,\" Leslie said with her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what's going to happen to me?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. Some girls gain weight more in one place like butt and thighs while others gain more up in their chest,\" Leslie explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belly giggled when she heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seeing you, and since I know you gained, I know that you gain more all over, but just a bit more in the belly area,\" Leslie said as she pushed a finger into May Belle's belly, which caused her to giggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to end up being in bed all day?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I tried to say was that this weight gain thing isn't something that's going to stay between you and me. Every pound you gain appears on your body and people will notice that. Surely, your parents and siblings will. At school, during P.E., if you change, the other girls will clearly see your belly is bigger. I mean, I understand you don't want to tell. I'm just trying to say they are all going to notice it sooner or later,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle started to think. Leslie was right. Others would notice sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know others will notice, but... I... just... don't... want to... tell... them... yet. I mean, they won't notice for some time, will they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on how much you gain and how clear it is. With a little body like yours, it will be more noticeable than on a tall body since on a tall body, the fat has more room to spread,\" Leslie said while pointing to her body.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nMay Belle understood that her gaining weight idea would become a bit more complicated than she first thought, but that didn't mean to say she wanted to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I will need to tell them sooner or later, but I choose later. And you won't tell them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already promised you I won't. But please, talk with Jesse. He's really worried about you and if we're in Ter....

I feel like you are the only one who understands,\" May Belle said, looking up to Leslie more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're welcome, May Belle. I'm glad you trust me,\" Leslie said and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Leslie went into her refrigerator and took out some left overs from dinner the previous night, which consisted of pieces of fried chicken, french fries, and pudding for dessert. After Leslie warmed the food up, May Belle started to eat the chicken with speed, savoring the taste of the grease and breading the most. When all of the pieces of chicken were gone, all that was left were the remains in bones. May Belle continued on as she started to shovel the french fries into her mouth to the point where her cheeks were stuffed like a chipmunk's cheeks. She quickly ate her way through the food as Leslie watched in awe at the girl's gluttony. She couldn't believe May Belle could eat this much food. Finally, May Belle finished the fries, reaching for the big bowl of pudding. Instead of using her manners to eat the pudding, May Belle stuck her whole head into the pudding, eating like a dog. She even got some pudding on her hat, which showed how messy she was eating. May Belle continued until she licked the whole bowl clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You ate so much. Are you full yet?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am! Thanks,\" May Belle said as she held her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was shocked with the amount of food eaten. Somehow, Leslie was getting more curious with being fat, but she didn't know what to think. All she knew was that May Belle at some point was going to be huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince May Belle was done, Leslie had some plans for the two.</span></div></div>",

Jesse, Joyce Ann and I always have to do it with used clothes. Jesse really hates it since it's all girl clothes.

Try these on,\" Leslie said while she gave her some shirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle put them on. They were a good fit for now, but it hugged May Belle's body clearly. Leslie looked a bit worried at the little girl. The clothes fit May Belle, but they were a bit long for the little girl, especially since Leslie was pretty tall for her age to start with.

Well, I must say I really like Leslie a lot. Go ahead and talk,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest, I was a bit worried about you.

I mean, some people like it. I mean, Dad loves our Mom, but he said that other people are attracted to other things. Couldn't it be that some people are attracted to fat girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse didn't know what to say. What his little sister said did make some sense. He for once was attracted to Leslie, but he knew another boy at school that only liked girls with big breasts. He also knew another boy who said he wanted a brunette with long legs. So why wasn't it possible someone liked a fat girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. It could be that someone is attracted, but most boys aren't. But still, it's unhealthy,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is starving yourself to be thin. Smoking is also bad for your health, but enough people do it. Also, a lot of people do drugs. Besides, I heard about people who pump up their breasts, lips, and other body parts. Isn't that unhealthy? Then you have people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, May Belle decided to go over to Leslie. Leslie lived closer and besides, she wasn't allowed to go over to the town on her own. Even if she was, she didn't have enough money to buy clothes.<br>\r\nLeslie had some food ready. To be honest, she liked having the little girl over, like the little sister she never had. She used to be lonely as an only child, but now with Jesse as her best friend and May Belle like some sort of little sister, Leslie didn't felt so lonely anymore.<br>\r\nAs soon as she saw May Belle come over to them, she already opened the front door and lead her straight to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you would like some food again,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I would. I'm really starved,\" May Belle said while she let her fat jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have some food for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie started making a banana split. She must admit she was surprised how much food that belly of that little girl could hold, but she liked to see her eat food and to see her get fatter. She didn't know exactly why, but she liked it. It wasn't like she did anything wrong. Is it a crime to feed someone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, now that I'm thinking about it, there's something else. Do you maybe have some clothes for me?\" May Belle asked. \"The ones you gave me last time are getting tight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry, May Belle, but I don't have any old clothes left. You took them all. Besides that, I was also thin as a little girl. So they wouldn't fit you anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle just took a bite and looked at Leslie while her spoon was still sticking out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's bad news. My clothes are starting to get too tight and I'm afraid my Mom won't go to the shop anymore to get bigger clothes because... because she thinks I'm getting too fat. But I like being fat, and I want to get fatter! I need to have new clothes, but I can't go to town on my own and even if I could, I don't have enough money to buy them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie started to think. Giving May Belle food was no problem. They had enough food and money for that, but clothes were a lot more expansive than some food. She didn't think her parents were fine with her buying clothes for May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bad news. Clothes are expensive,\" Leslie said as she looked at May Belle's gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think even the clothes I have now won't fit you. Around the waist, you're wider than me,\" Leslie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle saw that Leslie was probably right, but that didn't solve her problem. She started wolfing down her ice cream while she started thinking of a way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It may be cheap, but maybe we can still find some nice, bigger clothes for you. What do you think?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the idea, but I only have twenty dollars in my room. I don't know how much I could buy with that,\" May Belle said, wondering about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what. How about we go and see. If you need some more clothes, I wouldn't mind putting in a small amount of my money. Okay?\" Leslie reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Wow! Thank you, Leslie!\" May Belle said, running up to her and giving Leslie a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time, May Belle. Any time!\" Leslie said with a grin as she hugged May Belle. She could definitely feel more of her fat, but it made the hug more enjoyable for Leslie, who was enticed by the fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, May Belle went over to her house, went up to her room, and grabbed her money. As she walked downstairs, she saw her Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie. Where are you going?\" May Belle's Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I please go into town with Leslie? We wanted to look at some stuff at Salvation Army. Is that okay?\" May Belle asked, hoping her Mom would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay! But be back before dinner and be good with Leslie. And don't have her buy anything for you, sweetie. Don't you have some money, too?\" May Belle's Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I have twenty dollars saved. I'll use that if I get anything,\" May Belle said. She wanted to make it seem like she wasn't going to buy a lot of clothes because she didn't know what her Mom would think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You dress warmly because it is still very cold out! I'll see you later!\" May Belle's Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle as usual put on her winter coat, boots, gloves, and winter hat. She then walked out to see Leslie waiting for her. She too was dressed warmly, wearing a white winter jacket, black boots, white gloves, and a white tassel hat with pom pom accents. Leslie was so skinny in May Belle's eyes. She was cute in her own way. Part of May Belle wondered what Leslie would be like if she was fat, but the idea faded as Leslie started to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your Mom approve?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she did. We are all set to go!\" May Belle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the girls started to walk on the roads into town as the winter snow began to steadily fall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you for taking me to Salvation Army,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. I like going there myself. Like they say, one man's junk is the other's treasure. What's so good about used stuff is that it is another word for having a story!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a few rich, snobby girls in my class that say used stuff is another meaning for never in my life. But in my familym you don't have much of a choice,\" May Belle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used stuff does have stories. You only need to use your imagination. Let's go! We're here,\" Leslie said as she pointed to the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren't many people. Leslie and May Belle slowly walked in and looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, May Belle, if you're planning to gain more weight, I think you should better go for clothes that are a few sizes bigger and that are elastic so if you grow, they stretch. That way they last longer. How is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea. I think we should do that,\" May Belle answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they looked between old clothes, May Belle got a bit curious and asked: \"What do you and Jesse do every day when you two go to the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... well, that's something between Jesse and I. It's some sort of a secret, but it's nothing wrong or something. It's just something that's for me and him. It's a secret, so I won't tell you. You can keep asking until you weigh a pound more, but I won't tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course made the little girl only more curious, but she decided to try to find out later. She didn't want to make Leslie angry or irritate her while she still needed some clothes. Besides, Leslie also needed to take her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't this fun? It's pretty big, too,\" Leslie said, holding a t-shirt with the McDonald's logo on it and the words: I'm loving it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know, the fun part is that people who go to McDonalds a bit too much need to have a t-shirt this size!\" Leslie said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it,\" May Belle said. \"Oh, how about that one? Isn't that good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked and saw some dark pink elastic pants. Those would be perfect for the gaining girl. She smiled at her and nodded and saw another t-shirt that said: There's no problem that can't be solved with chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's so true,\" May Belle said. \"Chocolate can solve every problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked further and found another pair of elastic pants and a sweater. All were a few sizes too big, but that would probably change soon. On the other hand, she didn't hope too soon or else she couldn't keep up. But at least the shirt and pants could stretch so she could probably wear them longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle paid for her clothes and even while her mother told her not to let Leslie help, Leslie also took a few clothes. She even bought some for herself, mostly some warm clothes for in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I wonder what you do in the forest. Is it something Mom and Dad are not allowed to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's nothing that our parents would forbid us, but it's a secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell me anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could if Jesse would agree with me. You know what... I will ask him,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle knew for sure Jesse would never agree.  </span></div></div>",

Both of them were trying to see if they could find any fairies that would give them secrets about Terabithia. As they were searching, Leslie thought it was the right time to ask Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yesterday, May Belle asked about what we did back here,\" Leslie said to Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I never thought she would ask,\" Jesse said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either. But anyway, I was just thinking, what if we did tell her?\" Leslie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse immediately looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't think so,\" Jesse said quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it such a big deal, Jesse? I mean, it's just your sister and she is so kind and sincere. I mean, I've had fun hanging around her and I think she should know,\" Leslie said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, but I really don't want her to know,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Jesse? Why is it such a big deal?\" Leslie asked, getting closer to Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jesse did the unexpected. He grabbed the back of Leslie's head, moved closer, and kissed her on the lips. She didn't resist as he did this, but he backed away a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I really care about you. This is the one thing I feel that has brought us closer. Look, I haven't said anything before because I didn't know how to say it, but I really do like you. I feel like Terabithia has brought us together and I just want this to be our thing. I mean, what do you think?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie was so shocked with what just happened. She wanted to pull her hat down over her head to hide her red cheeks, but she started to think. He had a point, but she still felt bad for May Belle's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, I care about you, too. I have for a while,\" Leslie started, making Jesse smile.</span></div></div>",

This is our land and not someone elses,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it means that much to you, I won't tell her. But can no one ever know?

So he or she can come. But if it's the kid from one of us... I guess he or she can also come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit I would like to have children once. Not now, but when I finish school and get a job and own a house and have a boyfriend,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course. A boyfriend. You need that.

Both of them liked it an didn't want to stop. But finally, it stopped and both kids looked each other in the eyes. It looked like the world had stopped moving for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does... that answer your question?\" Jesse asked with a red head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You bet it does. I liked it,\" Leslie said with red cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the house?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most important is that it is near a forest. That's most important for me!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jesse mumbled with a dreamy look on his face. \"I think I would like that, too. When I think how many times I played in this forest, I think it's terrific for kids,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you also want kids?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Eh, yeah. Not now, of course, but like you said, after school and after I found a job and a house. Well, you know, maybe then. Just like you,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we do fit great together, right?\" Leslie said. \"Hm. I wonder what your sister is doing now,\" Leslie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess she just sitting on her fat butt. She became kind of lazy lately. If she didn't need to, she even wouldn't come out of bed,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie didn't say anything since she thought she might have told May Belle that exercise would let her lose weight, which made her avoid better. <br>\r\nShe climbed higher in the tree to the top and looked over Terabithia with Jesse next to her.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She noticed how it was still cold outside because of the chilled feeling she immediately felt. In addition, she also remembered why she was feeling so cold. She remembered that she slept naked. Sure, she had clothes that fit her, but at the same time, she was too lazy to constantly change clothes. To retain her fat, she knew that she had to be permanently lazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs May Belle woke up some more, she took the cover off of her, noticing her naked body. She felt how her double chins felt like they were becoming her neck. Her belly stuck out in front of her in many rolls, bulging out in different directions. At this point, her thighs were touching and rubbing up against each other. She scratched her butt, feeling how much fatter her butt had gotten over time. Slowly, May Belle began feeling her arms as they looked like they were stuffed to be made into pillows. Finally, she noticed how her boobs were a lot bigger as she started to grab them and squish them, noticing that all they were was fat. Overall, she liked her fattened look. At this point, May Belle had lost all resemblance of her former skinny self. Her small, skinny body was consumed in many added layers of fat. At this point, May Belle tried to get up, but then stopped trying to get up and remained seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, screw it! I don't even want to get out of bed!\" May Belle said as she plopped her fat self down into bed. She then reached over to her night stand, opened a drawer, and brought out some food, including two bigger bags of chips and a king size bag of candy she got when out with Leslie. May Belle opened up each bag and started to shove the food contents into her face, adding on calories and unused energy to her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmpphh!!! This- mmphh- is so- mpphh- BURP- delicious!\" May Belle said through bites as she kept on eating and eating. She continued to stuff her face silly for a while until she heard laughter that brought her out of her sedated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" May Belle asked. Slowly and lazily, May Belle pulled her naked body of out bed and looked outside her window, noticing that Leslie and Jesse were walking together and holding hands, which seemed a little unusual to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird. Wonder if I should go and check that out,\" May Belle said, debating with herself.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She quickly made sure she was under her blanket and shoved the bags under her bed and went lying just in bed rubbing her belly. Then Jesse appeared at the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?... You're still in bed? What is this? Are you sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just lazy. That's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know that exercise is a good way to lose weight and that not enough exercise and too much fat food can cause weight gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know that, too. I know a lot of things. What's up with you and Leslie? I saw you two holding hands. What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that doesn't mean anything. Come on you. Do something. Get out of bed,\" Jesse demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I'm not wearing any clothes,\" May Belle said, wrapping her blanket tight around her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Ah! You know what? Forget it. I give up. I you want to eat yourself to immobility, fine... go ahead. See if I care. I can't believe Mom and Dad agreed with this. Let you eat yourself obese. I'm going to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle was happy Jesse said he wouldn't care about her weight gain any more, but he did remind her about their parents. They weren't fond of her weight some time ago and she was sure they weren't fond of the extra pounds she added to her body. She believed she must be the fattest kid in her class or at least one of the fattest.  <br>\r\nSuddenly, May Belle heard snoring. Jesse's snoring meant he was asleep. She pulled the bags out from under her bed and continued her feast. She started to stuff the food in her mouth like she hadn't eaten in days. Soon, the bags were empty except the crumbs on her body and blanket. Softly, she picked up the pieces and put them in her mouth since it would be difficult to explain to her Mom how they came in her bed. Well, not hard to explain, but she knew her Mom wouldn't like the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should get out of bed. If Mom calls me for dinner and I'm still naked in bed, she won't be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the candy from a king sized bag and two entire bags of chips in her belly, she didn't need to go over to Leslie's house to eat. She would be full until dinner. She slowly rolled out of bed like a beached whale and pulled some of the clothes on the floor to herself and pulled them on. She didn't even bother to look if they were dirty, which made her look like more of a fat pig.<br>\r\nAfter that, she pushed herself to her feet. Her muscles were still a little weak from her recent nap. Slowly, she waddled downstairs. No one was home and she waddled over to the couch and parked her fat ass on the couch. She belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops excuse... wait what am I doing? There's no one here who heard me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the remote to watch some T.V and wouldn't move until it was dinner time. </span></div></div>",

The family was having fried chicken with mashed potatoes and greasy gravy, stuffing, corn, and ice cream for dessert. The family was at the point where they were done eating, which left May Belle to eating as much as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, May Belle, you sure ate a lot,\" May Belle's Mom said nicely. She didn't support her daughter with gaining weight, but she knew she couldn't stop her. Jesse rolled his eyes as May Belle refilled her plate and stuffed her fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse and May Belle, Grandma called earlier today. She was wondering if you two wanted to go to her house this weekend before you go back to school. What do you guys think?\" May Belle's Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, May Belle looked at her Mom as she exited her food coma for a moment. She started to grin as she thought about being with her Grandma. Her Grandma was a little more wealthy than her family, which meant she did more things. One of the things she always did was cook and buy food for her grandchildren. Even when Jesse went over to their Grandma's he would gain a couple of pounds, but lost it when he got back home. May Belle knew this was the perfect oppertunity for her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" May Belle said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well someone is enthusiastic,\" May Belle's Dad said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. What about you, Jesse?\" Asked their Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I was wondering though, can I bring Leslie with me? You know, it would be nice to bring up a friend,\" Jesse said, knowing that his family still didn't know about his new girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask Grandma when I call her tonight. I will let you know,\" their Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle continued to eat and stuff herself silly until finally, she was able to eat some ice cream. The whole time, Jesse looked at her and frowned. </span></div></div>",

I do, but why doesn't she invite your other sisters? They are her grandchildren after all,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joyce Ann likes mom and she can't sleep if her mother isn't around. If she need to sleep somewhere else, she cries the whole night. As for Ellie and Brenda, they say they are a bit too old to spend two entire days there. They want to go out and do other stuff,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they wanted to come, Grandma would have gladly let them also come over. But for now...\" Jesse mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma also is a great cook. She can cook better than anyone else. I bet she will make pie for dessert. She knows about any kind of recipe. She has traveled a lot and also tasted the strangest things like snails, frog legs, and even bugs,\" May Belle said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate frog legs once or twice,\" Leslie said flatly. \"Taste just like chicken. Not  that I don't like chicken, but I think it's a bit sad to kill a frog for such a small piece of meat while when you have a chicken, you have a lot more meat and tastes exactly the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma also lives near a forest. Just like us. There also is a lake in the forest and there are also huge grass fields and...\"  May Belle was saying, but was suddenly cut off by Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give her some air, squirt. She'll see it when we're there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far away from Terabithia,\" Leslie whispered to Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle was rubbing her belly but clearly heard it. <br>\r\nTerabithia. She couldn't remember if she ever heard that name. Could it be there was a village or town on the other side of the forest with that name? She didn't think there was and she knew the names of all the other towns and villages nearby. Her sisters talked a lot about them mostly complaining they didn't live there.<br>\r\nShe would ask her Grandma about that when she was alone with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to taste some of Grandma's terrific cooking,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked worried at his sister. He knew how good his Grandma could cook and he always gained weight after he had been there, but he always lost it when he got back home. He also knew for sure Leslie would also. But May Belle was a different story. With her huge appetite and her lack of exercise, her weight would probably sky rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. We're here,\" Jesse said.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids got out of the car and Leslie softly whistled when she saw the house. It was huge. There was enough room for all the kids in a orphanage or for two families.<br>\r\nMay Belle rang the doorbell and the door opened. Leslie saw for the first time Jesse's and May Belle's Grandma.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was in her sixties with curly brown hair, some wrinkles that showed maturity, and a slightly rounded figure. She had lived on her own ever since her husband passed years ago, but that didn't stop her from being so kind to everyone she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you all could come for the weekend,\" their Grandma said. They had all put their stuff upstairs already as they all headed for the kitchen. Her house was huge! It had to be at least seven times the size of Jesse's and May Belle's home. Everything in the house sparkled and looked brand new, which was different for Jesse and May Belle especially. Leslie was definitely impressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad, too! We've been looking forward to this all week,\" Jesse said with a smile to Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's still snow outside, but I know that this weekend will still be fun,\" their Grandma continued while they entered the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, May Belle could start to smell the aroma of food. Leslie and Jesse quickly followed as they all looked at the kitchen table. In front of them was a huge feast that looked like it was meant for a family of eight! There was a turkey in the middle of the table that had May Belle's name all over it. Around it surrounded corn on the cob, sweet potatoes with a marshmellow coating, pies of different sorts, stuffing, french fries, and even some fried chicken. It was apparent that Grandma Aarons did her best to make the kids feel full and satisfied at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've worked on this meal all day. I hope you all like it. I'm going to go change some laundry for now. Go on and dig in,\" Grandma Aarons said as she pointed to the meal and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle didn't have to be told twice. She quickly took her place at the table and started to grab everything she could reach. By the time she got everything, there was a big mound of food on her plate. Jesse and Leslie slowly sat down to join her, each grabbing more food than usual. Jesse couldn't help take his eyes off of May Belle as she tore through her food so fast and greedily. He knew that he told May Belle that he didn't care if she gained anymore, but a part of him was still not okay with it as he slowly started to bite into his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This food is amazing!\" Leslie said in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Isn't it?\" May Belle said through mouthfuls of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, Jesse looked over at his girlfriend to see how much she was eating, hoping that she wouldn't gain too much weight.</span></div></div>",

He always lost it and he thought Leslie would also. Besides, in a few weeks, there was another running competition. He and Leslie both knew that and were training with each other since even while they liked each other, they wouldn't let the other win. Training against each other would let Leslie lose the weight. But May Belle wouldn't lose it for sure.<br>\r\nJesse was halfway through his first plate while May Belle finished her first plate, even though she took about two times as much as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still hungry?\" He asked in a normal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I am!\" May Belle yelled. \"Why do you care anyway? I thought you didn't care anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. I was just wondering,\" Jesse said in a tone as if he didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie decided it was best to stay out of this. Sure, she gave May Belle food and wasn't planning on stopping doing that, but if Jesse was talking against May Belle about her weight, she thought it was more wise to stay out of it.<br>\r\nGrandma on the other hand noticed there was something on between two of her grandchildren. She also noticed that May Belle gained a lot of weight. You couldn't miss it. But she herself saw no problem in that. May Belle was her grandchild and she liked to spoil her grandchildren especially since she knew that they weren't so wealthy at home. In addition, since Jesse and especially May Belle were younger, they many times got the used products of their older sisters. To be honest, she also liked May Belle's fatter figure.<br>\r\nLeslie also looked at May Belle and she also liked the extra weight on the little girl, but she couldn't explain why. She could not even explain to herself why she liked it so much.<br>\r\nShe also saw how she finished the entire turkey by herself. She licked the bones totally clean. <br>\r\nJesse and May Belle never had been able to eat all the food on the table before. But this time, with some help from Leslie and especially May Belle who ate for almost four people, all the food was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I can't believe how much I ate,\" Leslie moaned. \"I think I never have eaten so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse slowly rubbed his belly just like May Belle did. All bellies were bloated at this point. Jesse slowly stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Leslie. Want to go outside? I will show you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea! Then I can let some of this food digest,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dress warm. It's very cold outside. Also very slippery,\" Grandma said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma looked with a smile at the two children. She knew the two were obviously in love. She already suspected that when she saw Leslie the first time. May Belle also stood up, but Grandma took her by the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Belle, I would like it if you came with me for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle didn't know what her Grandmother wanted, but she loved her and even while she tried doing hardly anything and tried being as lazy as possible, she wanted to make an exception for her Grandma. She took May Belle to the living room and smiled when she heard the front door closing. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"What is it Grandma? Why did I need to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think it's better if you leave your brother and Leslie alone for some time. They want to spend some time together with no little sisters or brothers,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any other brothers. Only Jesse,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't Leslie have any brothers?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's an only child,\" May Belle said flatly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah! I see. I also see you've changed a lot. You've became very voluptuous,\" Grandma said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volu... what? Does that mean fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to say it like that,\" said Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle looked at Grandma and wondered if she should tell her that she wanted to gain weight or not.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

What about it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have been gaining on purpose. You see, I started eating more. After a while, I really starting liking the extra weight in many ways. Now, I'm gaining because I want to. I know a lot of people would never do it, but I am happy that I am,\" May Belle said with some pride. In all honesty, May Belle didn't know how her Grandma was going to react. Moments later, her Grandma smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was beautiful, May Belle. I am happy for you,\" said her Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You don't think it's weird or wrong or anything?\" May Belle said while sounding shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. It's what you are and what you want to be. Plus, the extra weight looks cute on you,\" said her Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That made me happy. Jesse doesn't like me gaining and my parents try to accept it,\" May Belle said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about them, darling. They're just not used to it. They can't do anything about it. Look, this weekend will be fun. I'll feed you loads of food, you can be lazy, and I'll even take you out shopping for some new clothes. A growing girl like you can always use some. How does that sound?\" May Belle's Grandma said in a positive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great. Thanks, Grandma!\" May Belle said, gaining confidence in her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, dear. I'll go get you some cake from the kitchen,\" said her Grandma as she walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sliced some cake for May Belle, she looked outside of her window to see snow falling all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Jesse and Leslie are doing.

Don't worry. At home, they're outside a lot of the time. After school, they always went straight to the forest no matter how cold it was. They can take it. They're outside so much, they're used to it,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I hope so. It seems like she is such a nice girl. She is very pretty and polite. I can understand why Jesse likes her,\" said May Belle's Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle took a slice of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like her, too. She's really nice to me. She even sort of helped me with the weight gain. She gave me food every day and also some of her old clothes. She even went clothes shopping with me. Well, it was used clothing, but still, it was pretty nice of her. She also said she would try to talk to Jesse about my weight gain, but I don't think that has really worked,\" May Belle said with a fat frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe it didn't work, but I'm sure she tried. But she can't force Jesse to like your weight gain,\" said May Belle's Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to. He just needs to accept it and stop being so mean to me because of it,\" May Belle said in a more harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle started to eat her first slice of cake while her Grandma looked outside. Jesse was outside with a girl. Well, she wasn't worried. When she was a young girl, she also went to the forest with her future husband. So it was no wonder Jesse liked the forest so much. It was in his blood. She was happy Jesse met such a nice girl. He didn't have many friends. He normally only did things with May Belle and in addition was normally alone making drawings. As his Grandma, she was proud at everything he did, but she must admit she would have liked it if he had some more friends. It didn't matter to her if they were girls or boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear me, Grandma?\" May Belle asked, waking her grandma from her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sweet heart. I was lost in my thoughts and I'm getting old. What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I wonder why so many people are against being fat. I mean, it looks nice. Doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever look in those clothing magazines?\" Grandma asked. \"Because I do and mostly the only models I see are stick figures that suffer from anorexia. It's terrible. It makes it even worse that many young girls think that they need to be thin to look pretty, which makes many starve themselves just to look good when they look good just the way they are. Some people are already worried if they gain a single pound, although there's nothing wrong with being a bit heavy. Now, the image of beauty is a thin girl where you can count their ribs. But in my time, when I was about your age, that was different. Back then, girls needed to be fat. They needed to have some nice female curves. Back then, you had some drawings of those sex models that were all fat. Back then, that was considered sexy,\" May Belle's Grandma continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was born about seventy years too late,\" May Belle said while she started into her fifth slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Don't feel so bad. Maybe not now, but I'm sure in the future, a man would love your fat, curvy body and fall in love with you,\" May Belle's Grandma said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" May Belle said. \"Say Grandma, could you tell me a story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Come here near the fire place,\" said May Belle's Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma took a big book of fairy tales from the book shelf and sat in a chair near the fire place just like May Belle and started to read. May Belle listened while in the meantime, she finished the entire cake.   <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Leslie pulled her white pom pom hat with tassels down as it started to come off her head from running so much. Jesse did the same to his as he was following her. At this particular point, they had gotten into a small snow ball fight as they both took cover behind trees. Leslie quickly crouched down and started making snow balls while Jesse was throwing the ones he had freshly made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Leslie? Do you give up? I'll go easy on you if you do,\" Jesse said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams, Jesse. I always win,\" Leslie said as she admired the pile of snow balls she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jesse threw his last snow ball, Leslie grabbed the first one on top of her pile and began to throw it at Jesse. Unfortunately, she had just thrown off the mark as it flew past his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call that a throw? I could throw better snow balls in my sleep,\" Jesse said with a light laugh as he began to crouch down and make some more snow balls as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Leslie just waited until she had the perfect moment to throw her snow balls. She just needed Jesse to get up from behind the tree so she could throw her snow balls perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jesse? Are you trying to hide from me?\" Leslie teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute or two, Jesse came out from the tree while beginning to throw his snow ball. This was Leslie's perfect shot. As quickly and accurately as she could, Leslie threw a snow ball right for his head as it flew quickly in the air. For her sake, Jesse's snow ball scooted by her head. As Jesse noticed his failure of a throw, he got caught off guard as he saw Leslie's snow ball coming for his face. Too late for him to move out of the way, the snow ball broke apart in his face, making Leslie laugh hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who throws terribly now,\" Leslie said with a laugh as she walked toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith snow in his face, Jesse walked towards Leslie. As he got closer to her, he wiped the snow right out of his face to see that Leslie was in front of him smiling. Suddenly, his emotions began to change as he became happier. He realized how lucky he was to have Leslie. She was standing in front of him smiling with her slender, white winter coat on. He even noticed how her pants were slender on her as well. On top of that, she was wearing her matching white gloves with her white hat covering her blond hair. After seeing that, he noticed Leslie's face. Her cheeks were the color crimson as she continuously smiled with white teeth. But what really grabbed his attention was Leslie's crystal clear eyes. She even noticed his admiration, which made her grin and look into his eyes. Jesse couldn't help but feel lost in her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jesse said as he inched closer to Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Leslie said as she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords didn't have to describe how the two felt about each other as they slowly leaned in for a kiss. Both of them began to pull one another down to the ground and continue to kiss each other. Soon enough, they began to roll into the snow as they kissed. At some points, they would pull out and just smile at one another, savoring the perfect moment. They had no other cares in the world. All they were moved by was each other.</span></div></div>",

Grandma made it especially for her gaining granddaughter. After the pie, she finished an entire bag of pretzels, a box of cookies, and a box of donuts. But still, she had room for more. So Grandma made another entire apple pie for her with a lot of fat in the pie and fattening whipped cream topped on it. She was surprised how much her granddaughter could eat, but she must admit that in one way, she even felt proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So honey, are you full?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Grandma. *burp* Excuse me.

Maybe he can beat her know,\" May Belle said through bites of pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he cares a lot about Leslie,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least more than about me. That's for sure. He still hates my weight for some reason. When I said I might like it, he said it was silly that someone could like it,\" May Belle said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thought it was silly?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Back then, he thought that. I think he found out that I really like it, but he's still no fan of the weight gain. Too bad,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you must understand that Jesse only wants to help you. He was maybe a bit mean about your weight, but I'm sure it was with the best interests,\" Grandma tried to reassure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that,\" May Belle said in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. He's your brother. You two always used to play together,\" Grandma commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it. We used to play together, but he never does that anymore,\" May Belle said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma looked outside. The falling white flakes were now bigger and there were much more. She started to get worried about Jesse and Leslie. Letting them outside with cold weather was one thing, but letting them out while it was snowing like this was something else. She was just thinking about getting her coat to go look for them when suddenly, she heard the front door open. Leslie and Jesse walked in. Both were wet and white from the snow with red faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god you two are back. I was starting to get worried!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! We lost track of time,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's better to take off that wet clothing and after that get warm by the fire,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie and Jesse nodded and went to their rooms to get changed. A few minutes later after taking off all their winter clothes, they were all four sitting in front of the fire.   </span></div></div>",

May Belle and Grandma were all sitting in a chair talking to one another while Jesse and Leslie were laying down on the floor with Jesse's arm wrapped around Leslie. Grandma and May Belle saw this, but didn't pay too much attention to it because they did not want to create any awkwardness. After a while of relaxing, Grandma went into the kitchen to make them all a snack. After fifteen minutes, Grandma came back out with some brownies for the crowd to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys eat some of these while I go clean some dishes in the kitchen,\" Grandma said as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the kids began to grab a brownie each. They all let out a satisfied moan from the chocolate savorful taste. May Belle, of course, ate her brownie the fastest and moved to the next one. After finishing a brownie, Leslie got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go get a drink. I'll be back,\" Leslie said while sneaking in a kiss to Jesse. May Belle didn't even notice as she was tucked into eating her brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Leslie walking into the kitchen, May Belle and Jesse were stuck together in the room alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you liking that brownie a little too much?\" Jesse asked May Belle while he looked at his sister's slightly bigger figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, if you are going to comment on my weight anymore, just shut up,\" May Belle said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, May Belle. I wasn't trying to diss you. I don't care anymore,\" Jesse admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, May Belle stopped eating her brownie and looked at Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say?\" May Belle asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't really like the whole weight gain thing and I am kind of against it for reasons. However, if you really want to gain weight, I won't stop you anymore. I will try to get used to it,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle realized that Jesse was not admitting to being okay with her getting fat, but she felt like this was a start. She just wondered if he was being sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" May Belle said with a smile, trying to understand her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Leslie had just walked in, which was brought to Grandma's attention quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Leslie! What can I help you with?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I possibly have a glass of water?\" Leslie asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure! Anything for you, dear,\" Grandma said to Leslie as she served her a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Leslie responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime. So I hear Jesse doesn't really support May Belle with her weight gain,\" Grandma mentioned to Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, I've been slowly trying to help, but I don't know what he thinks about it anymore. I just hope things would work out for them,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you, Leslie. Knowing Jesse, though, I would think he may actually like fatter people,\" Grandma commented with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie started to look kind of surprised. She didn't really know what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think that?\" Leslie asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually when someone gets so angry about weight gain like Jesse did, it could mean that they are trying to hide the fact that they actually like it. Who knows. Maybe if you gained weight, he would tell you that,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie immediately looked at her figure. Yes, she was very slim, but she didn't know what to believe. She had been curious before about weight gain, but she really wasn't sure if she could do it. Really, Leslie was trying to think what would happen if she did and if it would be positive or not.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it's not like I don't eat enough. I eat just like any other kid, but I just don't gain. Maybe because I burn all those calories. Besides, you said that you thought he liked it,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did. What's wrong with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... suppose you're wrong and he doesn't like it. Then I'm stuck with extra weight. I don't have any experience with it, but I heard it's very difficult to lose weight,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is. If it was easy, there wouldn't be that many obese people. Since for some reason people are way too concerned about their weight, if they gain one pound, they think they are too fat while they're still toothpick girls,\" Jesse's Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't care that much about my weight. But I wasn't really planning to gain weight. Besides, I'm not sure how Jesse would react. Suppose he doesn't like it? What then? We are really good friends now. I don't want to risk something,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But suppose he tells you he would like you fatter. Then what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess I could try to gain some weight for him. If he really likes it. But there's a difference between obese, fat, and chubby,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would really help May Belle if you gained some weight and Jesse finds out that he really likes it. That way he can't get angry at his little sister for gaining weight. But it's your choice. It's your body after all,\" said Grandma.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nLeslie looked a bit confused. She knew it could help May Belle, but suppose even then Jesse didn't like it. He maybe wouldn't even like the weight on her. That would mean she needed to lose it. Besides, she helped May Belle more than enough. She then followed Grandma back to the living room. There she saw a stuffed May Belle with chocolate around her mouth. There were three brownies left on the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Leslie. We saved you some brownies,\" May Belle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! That's nice of you,\" Leslie said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, Jesse said he doesn't care about my weight anymore. He told me he didn't like the whole weight gain thing, but he would try getting used to it. At least he will stop being mean to me because of it. So that means I sort of... won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Jesse anyway?\" Leslie asked suddenly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the bathroom. He will be right back,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie suddenly realized that if Jesse really stopped caring about his sister's weight, it didn't matter anymore that she never gained weight. May Belle could continue gaining weight, she could stay the size she was, and help May Belle with gaining, and she and Jesse could still hang out together. No problems. Like a wise man once said: \"Sometimes don't try to solve a problem because the problem can solve itself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he was right,\" Leslie softly mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jesse came back. He smiled to Leslie and went sitting next to her. Leslie may not really want to gain weight, but she was a bit curious if Jesse maybe really had something for fat people? Could that be? She decided to worry about that later. But it kept nagging to her.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while of sitting and relaxing by the fire, Grandma had started to prepare dinner for the kids. She figured feeding them a big meal would help them all fall asleep quicker. Just like she had made before, Grandma made the same things from the previous meal, but put a few twists on some of the foods like the turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and others. After filling up the table, Grandma called the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for dinner! Come and get it,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the kids ran into the kitchen, beginning to lick their lips from the smell of the delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That smells very good,\" Jesse said with a pat to his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Leslie grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys already know what I'm thinking,\" May Belle said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, the kids rushed to the table and began to eat. Their Grandma watched them with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in, guys! I want to see every scrap gone!\" Grandma said as she walked out of the kitchen, letting them eat in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jesse went for the turkey and tried to get as much meat as he could put on his plate. He then got the stuffing and spread it across the turkey. Leslie, on the other hand, grabbed a bunch more turkey than Jesse, topped it off with mashed potatoes, and put on as much gravy as she could. May Belle, not surprisingly, put almost everything on her plate as her food looked like a mountain top. In essence, everyone was eating more than normal, stuffing their faces on the delicious food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Leslie felt her competitive side kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jesse. I bet I could eat a turkey leg covered in gravy the fastest,\" Leslie said as she grabbed a turkey leg and drenched it in gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse, not wanting to look like a chicken, did the same as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on,\" Jesse said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the two dug in like carnivores while May Belle was eating much more food in her own little world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the kids were enjoying themselves in their own ways, but they were all really acting gluttonous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour, the whole table was clear of food, leaving the three kids stuffed beyond belief. Jesse's face was covered with some grease from the turkey. Leslie, who fancied the gravy, had gravy spead on her face and dripped on her clothes. May Belle, being the pig she was, had so many things on her face, it was hard to tell all of the things that she ate. But, in reality, all of the kids clutched their bellies as they all felt super full.</span></div></div>",

One for Jesse in the room you two mostly sleep and two in the other room next to it for Leslie and May Belle,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids didn't complain. It wasn't that Grandma didn't trust the kids, but it was in her eyes still a bit strange to let kids of different sexes sleep in the same room. Besides, she also didn't think Jesse or Leslie wanted to undress in front of the other. None of the kids cared too much. Besides, they were all three way too tired. <br>\r\nMay Belle used the bathroom first while Jesse and Leslie watched some television. After that, Leslie used the bathroom and then Jesse after her. Leslie walked int he bedroom and saw May Belle was still up. She was sitting on her knees and was topless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Leslie. See how fat I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie must admit that being topless clearly showed how fat the other was. There was not much left of the thin kid she once was. Leslie knew she was partly responsible for this. Her belly looked even bigger because of all the food in it. Because of that, her belly was kind of hard. It felt a bit like a bag of wet cement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat until tomorrow. Then all the food will have digested and  it will make you way fatter. Then it will feel all soft,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it when it feels soft. It's fun to play with,\" May Belle said as she touched herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie took another look at May Belle and was a bit unsure what she needed to think about. A kid of the age of May Belle already got some boobs. Of course, they were made of 100% pure fat, but still. If this went on, she could even use a bra. Leslie decided not to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma said that Jesse perhaps likes fat,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Jesse likes the fat? No way. He has been non-stop teasing me with it. He promised me he'll stop teasing me, but he's still not fine with it,\" May Belle argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma said he is so against it just because he likes it. She even said I should try gaining some weight to let Jesse like it. Well, perhaps she's right and Jesse really likes it, but just doesn't want to admit it to himself,\" Leslie said with more thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you going to gain weight?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't plan on doing that,\" Leslie said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you look like?\" My Belle asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know how...\" Leslie started, but suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lying in bed. She had a pillow and a blanket. It was a very thick blanket since it was in the middle of the winter and Grandma thought it might get pretty cold. Leslie grabbed a pillow and stuffed in under her shirt to look fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this look?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look for yourself,\" May Belle said and pointed to a big mirror in a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie took a look and giggled, seeing how fat she looked. She then grabbed the blanket and stuffed the entire thing in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow now I look really fat,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Put my pillow and blanket also under your shirt,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie knew that her clothes would be very stretched after this, but she didn't care. After stuffing May Belle's pillow and blanket in her clothes, she looked in in the mirror and noticed she was now looking so fat, she couldn't even see her entire body on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look really good,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Perhaps. But I still don't think I'm going to gain weight,\" Leslie said while pulling the blankets and pillows out of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" May Belle said and took her blanket and pillow. \"I'm going to sleep. I'm tired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie pulled her pillow out and noticed that even with all the stuff out, she was fatter. Her belly was round and bloated. She remembered all the food she, Jesse, and May Belle ate. It must have been very fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. I will probably work it off, and if not, perhaps Jesse really likes it,\" She softly mumbled to herself and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you could only hear two soft breathings.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Instead of being in her room, she was in the gym at her school. She looked around and noticed that she was in a white t-shirt along with short shorts. Moments later, Leslie realized that her boyfriend, Jesse, was standing next to her also in gym clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'll race you around the gym,\" Jesse challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game on,\" Leslie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Leslie and Jesse stood next to each other on the outlines of the gym. Jesse began to count down until he hit one, followed by him screaming \"GO!\" They both suddenly took off and began to run around the gym. Leslie was in the lead for a little while because of her amazing physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you, Leslie!\" Jesse screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Leslie started to slow down a little bit as if she was out of breath. Her big lead was starting to dwindle down as Jesse approached. Moments later, Leslie stopped in her foot steps to notice something: she was starting to gain weight at a fast paste. Her belly was starting to push out from under her shirt while her butt was starting to poke out of her shorts. Jesse then leaped ahead of Leslie and won the race, cheering for himself. It was then he noticed what was happening  with Leslie as her face started to fill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Leslie screamed, feeling afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Leslie had broken 250 pounds, which was too much for her clothing. All of it immediately ripped off and fell to the floor, making way for her growing boobs, stomach, sides, arms, and thighs. Another minute went on as Leslie fell to the floor, landing on her butt. Totally naked in front of Jesse, Leslie was starting to take a ball shape, becoming immobile faster and faster by the second. Another minute passed, leading Leslie to stop filling up. At this point, she had no resemblance of a neck. Her boobs were definitely bigger than DD, which was amazing for her age. Besides her boobs, Leslie's personal parts were not showing because of her weight gain. Her butt looked like it was as wide as the circle in center court. The biggest feature of all was her belly, which took up a bunch of space. Even though Leslie was scared, she kind of liked the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, you look..... stunning,\" Jesse admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... feel..... hungry,\" Leslie said immediately as her stomach rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in the dream, food began to appear around the gym, circling the couple. Jesse kept on smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to fatten you up even more,\" Jesse smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Jesse climbed up Leslie's body, kissed her, and began to shove food down her fat throat. Although this was different, Leslie kind of liked the feeling of everything that was going on. She actually felt like she was in bliss with Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Leslie opened her eyes again, realizing that she was awake. Only a few hours had passed since she went asleep. The room and outside were filled with darkness while Leslie felt confused. She looked over at May Belle to see the little girl still topless and very, very fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on with me? First, May Belle gets fat. Then Jesse's Grandma questions me about it. Then I stuff myself with pillows to see how I look. Then, I have a dream about it?\" Leslie thought to herself, becoming more curious on if she should gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to ask Jesse.\"</span></div></div>",

A few minutes later, Leslie also woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine, May Belle,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" May Belle asked from under her blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you need to get food in your belly. You're hungry, right?\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Of course,\" May Belle said while she threw away her blanket. \"I must admit I'm really hungry. That's the only reason why I'm standing up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Belle, I wouldn't go downstairs topless. That might seem a bit strange,\" Leslie suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle quickly grabbed a t-shirt and pulled it on. Leslie noticed it was incredibly tight, but she recognized the shirt as one of the clothes they bought at the second hand store. Was that so tight already? How fast was she gaining?  <br>\r\nMay Belle ran downstairs and Leslie also got out of bed. She walked to the bedroom of Jesse and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" Leslie heard Jesse's sleepy voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie walked inside and saw Jesse was still in bed, but just like his sister, he didn't want to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Jesse,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hi, Leslie. Good morning to you, too. Guess we should get dressed before May Belle eats all the breakfast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesse, she won't. She'll leave some for us. Anyway, I have something important to ask you. I was wondering... do you like fat girls?\" Leslie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Do I like fat girls? Why would I like fat girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some people like girls with huge tits, other ones wants a brunette with long legs, a redhead with green eyes, or a girl with a hourglass shape. So why wouldn't someone like a fat girl especially in a time when there are enough fat girls around? Your Grandma said that you were so against May Belle's weight gain because you like fat,\" Leslie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes totally no sense. You know that,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. To be honest, it does make sense. But, well, May Belle is your sister and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to do with it?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply, would you like it if I gained. Don't say no without a second thought. First, try to image me with a bigger belly. Besides, my belly did get a little bigger,\" Leslie mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her shirt a bit. It was not high enough to show her breasts, but high enough to show her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Image it, Jesse. You have enough imagination to do it. Image it bigger and then tell me if you like it or not,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked some time at Leslie and tried to image it. He finally said...     </span></div></div>",

In some ways, he liked Leslie being fat. He thought that it looked attractive on her. However, he wasn't sure how much he wanted her to gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really?\" Leslie asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But there's just one thing about it,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" Leslie asked Jesse, wondering what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I have imagined, I would like to see you fat, but I don't know how fat I would want to see you. I mean, you are really pretty and some extra weight would make you look even more beautiful. I just don't know how much. I mean, I don't know if I want a small amount or you having May Belle's amount,\" Jesse said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I can understand that. Look, I will gain as much weight as I can if you want me to. I just need to know from you how much you would want me to gain,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you something,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Leslie went into her room followed by Jesse. She then did what she had done the night before. Leslie grabbed her pillows and began to stuff them into her pajamas. She kept on increasing the amount of stuffing, starting to add May Belle's pillows, sheets from both beds, and blankets. After doing that, Leslie was huge. She tried to look down at her feet and realized she couldn't see anything in front of her. Her pajamas were being very stretched, but she didn't care. She tried to look in the mirror as Jesse watched. Her whole body couldn't fit in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hug me,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse, feeling some what turned on by Leslie, hugged her and felt how soft she was. He smiled and continued into his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse began to think about it. He had two thoughts in his head. On one hand, he could ask Leslie to gain a lot and become down right obese like she had looked now with the pillows. He was curious with the idea, but he didn't know if he wanted her to try that. On the other hand, he imagined Leslie with a bigger belly as if she was pregnant. He liked the idea of it, but wondered if she would be okay with it.</span></div></div>",

Finally, he decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we should start with just a pregnant looking belly. After that, we'll see. You can still gain more weight after that,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! That sounds good. Let's get a pregnant looking belly. Let's get some breakfast! I'm starving,\" Leslie said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked to the kitchen where May Belle was already busy stuffing her face. She looked happy when she saw who entered the kitchen. She didn't forget her talk with Leslie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What *chew chew* took you *chew chew* so long?\" She asked with a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesse and I had an interesting talk with each other about some things,\" Leslie said while she dumped a big amount of food on her plate. Leslie noticed the smile of Jesse's Grandma with an approving nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle didn't notice this. She was too busy eating while Jesse noticed that those days at Grandma's house really paid off. Her belly was clearly visible, poking out between her pants and shirt, while they were really big sizes. He must admit he liked it. Why did he never see it like this before? Maybe because of society. What is normal is what most people think. But that isn't what everyone is thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Leslie and blinked, seeing how much she had already consumed. She was a fast eater. If Leslie wanted something, she could really go for it. He knew that by now and that was one of the things he liked about her. He wondered how long it would take her before she reached that size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm so sorry kids, but you can't go out today,\" Grandma suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why not?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Did you look outside?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked outside, seeing it was snowing so hard that you could hardly see anything outside. It wasn't the right weather to go outside. There was no way he would go outside. Also, Leslie gave the impression she would rather swallow poison than go outside at the moment. May Belle wasn't planning to go outside anyway and just continued stuffing her face. She became pretty good at that. But what would their parents think about May Belle's weight gain? That was an important question. They accepted it now, but Jesse wasn't sure they would keep accepting it. He slowly nibbled from his breakfast more, thinking, then eating, while the two girls ate their bellies round, bloated, and fat. Grandma seemed really happy with the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! I'm so full. I can't remember ever before eating so much in my entire life,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Same here,\" May Belle moaned. \"Grandma can sure make a huge breakfast,\" May Belle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again. But being so stuffed also feels good,\" Leslie said while she laid back and rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle did the same, but Jesse was still thinking about their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Leslie asked suddenly.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Just not in front of May Belle,\" Jesse quietly replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, May Belle burped from across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" May Belle said with a fat smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Leslie let out a burp, shocking Jesse who was sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Excuse me, too. I didn't feel that one coming,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jesse looked at Leslie's belly. It was bigger than before. It looked like a little mound on her smaller body frame. She was nowhere near obese, but she was slowly plumping up. Jesse started to feel turned on by this as he reached over and grabbed Leslie's hard belly. Leslie let out a soft groan as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. It feels really nice actually,\" Jesse replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle instantly noticed Jesse touching Leslie's belly. Just to play around with him, May Belle decided to get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, touch my belly!\" May Belle said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and awkwardly, Jesse approached his little, fat sister. He began to lightly grab her stomach. Even though she had just eaten, her stomach was so flabby as the bare skin appeared from under her shirt. It was weird that he was grabbing his sister, but he liked the feeling of the fat on his finger tips. After a minute, he let go as May Belle came up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, let's go weigh ourselves!\" May Belle suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll give that a try,\" Leslie said as they both got up. Leslie secretly kissed Jesse on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be right back,\" Leslie said as her and May Belle slowly walked to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there was a scale in our room.

I never thought that I liked fat, but I must admit that I now. well... like it. Isn't that strange? Suddenly, I think Leslie will look better if she was fatter,\" Jesse admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so strange,\" His Grandma said. \"Its just the same like how some men like a girl with huge boobs, blond girls, or redheads with green eyes. In all three cases, it's just what the man likes. It's not so strange. Besides, I knew you liked fat girls,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know. Leslie told me,\" He moaned. \"Besides, how did you know I liked fat girls?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a Grandma. I raised kids on my own and I babysat you and your sisters many times. When you're so young, you just do what you like and you don't care much about other things. If you know kids from such a  young age, you understand what they like and how they think,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well, I'm fine with May Belle's weight gain, and I'm also fine with Leslie gaining some weight along the way. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a but?\" Grandma asked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm fine with May Belle's weight gain, and Leslie too. Our other sisters don't care, but our parents aren't so fond of May Belle's weight gain,\" Jesse confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I see. Well, maybe sometime, I could tell them what they can and can't do is over for that, but I'm not sure. Now they're adults with their own lives, jobs, and kids. It's not my job to tell them how to raise their kids,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They talked to May Belle about it once before, and she convinced them to let her gain for now. But if she gains a lot more, I think they would really stop her,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" His Grandma said slowly. \"I could try to talk to them, but I'm not sure if they will listen. They could also think I am demented,\" she admitted.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you could try, right?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will talk to them,\" His Grandma said while she slowly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hopes it works,\" Jesse mumbled. \"Are those girls still upstairs? How long can it take to weigh yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, both girls stripped down. Since May Belle was still a young kid and they were both girls, Leslie hadn't a problem with it. She smiled when she saw the fat, naked girl with all her wobbling, jiggling fat that moved with every move she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should stand on the scale first?

But I bet that's going to be a little different,\" Leslie admitted as she patted her belly a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Leslie stood onto the scale as the numbers began to increase. The numbers kept on getting higher and higher as it began to move into the triple digits. May Belle noticed how the scale slowly approached 105, but slowly moved passed it.

We can just hang out in our room, stuff pillows and stuff in our clothes to look and feel a lot fatter, and we can both feed each other as much as we can.

Slowly, she stepped forward. She closed her eyes and stepped on the scale. She opened her eyes and had a bit trouble seeing past her huge belly. It was no wonder. The needle stopped at 143 pounds. She was even heavier than Leslie. However, she was also a lot smaller, which meant her weight had less room to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate so much the past time. I knew I gained. I don't know exactly how much I weighed last time, but I'm sure it wasn't even near this weight,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not only how much food you eat,\" Leslie said while she got dressed. \"It's also about what kind of food you eat, in other words if it's healthy or if it's fattening. What is also important is how much you exercise. Food gives you energy. The question is do you burn it. By exercising, you burn fat. But if you just sit on your butt, you won't burn any calories and those wait until you need them under your skin. That's what makes someone fat,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Leslie. You're smart. How do you know those things?\" May Belle asked while she got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School. Biology. It's fun to know stuff about animals or people. Don't worry. You will also get it when you're older,\" Leslie said to May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it hard? I mean, is biology difficult?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different. For some people, it's easy. But for some, it's hard.

He knew that May Belle was definitely bigger, but he was surprised to hear that she weighed that much. She almost weighed more than him, which was shocking to Jesse. In a way, he was happy to see that she had gained so much. However, he just wondered what his parents would say to her if they didn't approve of her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's great, May Belle. Good for you,\" Jesse said kindly, making May Belle grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Grandma came out of the kitchen and looked at the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just finished making a chocolate cake for you guys. Whoever wants it, go and get it. I am going to take a quick shower. Feel free to do whatever you want,\" Grandma said to the kids as she walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, May Belle and Leslie ran into the kitchen to view the cake. And what a site it was. The cake was a behemoth three feet tall and about two feet wide. It looked like their Grandma had prepared it all afternoon. The cake was covered in layers of chocolate frosting with sprinkles in certain areas. Immediately, both girls grew hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat right now!\" May Belle said to Jesse with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jesse and I wanted to check out the house. If you don't mind, I will take about half of the cake so he and I can look around,\" Leslie said as she got a plate and began to cut half of the cake onto her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well I will be here,\" May Belle said while Leslie and Jesse began to walk out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why couldn't we just eat the cake with her?\" Jesse asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your Grandma is in the shower. I mean, we haven't had any alone time. I wanted to look around the house. That and I just wanted to...... enjoy some private time with you,\" Leslie said as her face turned red. Jesse's face began to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, works for me,\" Jesse said as they went upstairs to start their stuffing and exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, May Belle was in the kitchen demolishing the cake. From the start, she used her pudgy hands to dig into the cake. As she licked her hands and savored the frosting, she noticed how she was acting even more like a pig. She finally let everything out as she slammed her head into the cake, eating the cake that way until every crumb and piece of frosting was in her mouth. When the plate was licked clean, May Belle leaned back and burped loudly as she moaned with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious. I wonder how much fatter I will get,\" May Belle wondered, hoping that someday she could become a huge ball of immobile fat. She hoped that someday, she could be able to reach that goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how Jesse and Leslie are doing,\" May Belle said as she got up to look for even more food. At this point, her belly was hanging out even more under her shirt.</span></div></div>",

But I worked them off when I got home when I was training to become the fastest runner in class,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you got defeated by a girl who you didn't even know!\" Leslie said while teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. I didn't like it that I was defeated by a girl. I trained all summer long to become the best, and then I got defeated by a girl. Since we're best friends now, I don't really care if you would defeat me,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I really gain, you'll maybe be able to beat me this year,\" Leslie said with a grin and took a big bite of her part of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now for something else. I didn't want to say this in front of May Belle. A problem is that when we get back home, my parents are still not going to be fine with May Belle gaining weight. If they find out how much she gained... Of course they find out. You only need to look at her. She's almost bursting out of her clothes,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get it. That's a problem. She can always eat at my house, of course, but I think your parents will find out sooner or later, and they won't be happy. So yeah. That's a problem,\"  Leslie said and took another big bite of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters won't help me. I don't think they really care if May Belle gets fat or thin. We can't expect help from them,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I'm afraid Grandma can't help you either. Her kids are now old enough to make their own decisions. This really is a big problem,\" Leslie said while she took another big bite of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse opened the door to the attic. Slowly he walked up the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your Grandma doesn't come up here often. Man, that's a lot of dust,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there isn't that much here upstairs. So there isn't really a reason for her to come up here,\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo rooms were empty. In another room was a box full of old paintings. Leslie didn't know much about paintings, but knew that some of them could be worth millions. The last was a old bedroom with a huge two persons bed, a nightstand, a light, two chairs, and a painting on he wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Another bedroom. Your Grandma has a big house,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse went sitting on the ground against the bed and Leslie went sitting next to him while taking her last bite of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, all gone. Too bad it's only a weekend here. If I would be here a month, I would be as round as a bowling ball at the end of that month,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will May Belle be when she get's home after a month here?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure if she gets home because I'm not sure if she fits through the door anymore,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth started laughing.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Moments later, they looked into each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Jesse?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have chocolate on your face,\" Jesse said as he pointed to the spots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!

Leslie looked around to try and see if she could run, but with the bed being against the wall, she really couldn't escape Jesse. He then laid down next to her on the bed as they both laid sideways looking into each other's eyes. Jesse used one of his hands to press his thumb against the spot on Leslie's face to remove it. Then, Jesse grabbed under her chin as they began to pull in for the sweetest kiss. They continued making out for a few moments until Leslie pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you got the spot,\" she grinned as they continued onward.</span></div></div>",

She suddenly noticed she could still eat some more. She wasn't really hungry, but with her desire to become fatter, she wanted to eat whenever she could. She stood up and waddled back to the kitchen. Her Grandma was busy there with the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello dear! Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I still could eat a bit more,\" May Belle mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more food?\" Grandma asked surprised. \"You're a born gainer! It's a wonder why you didn't want to gain weight before,\" she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's so strange to me. I mean, I never was a fat kid. Perhaps a bit chubby, but not too much to really notice. Then I suddenly started to get more hungry and started to eat more. Then I started to gain weight, become fat, and start liking the fat. My brother who first wanted me to lose weight is now positive about my gaining and his girlfriend is joining me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest she was happy about that part. Mostly it's more fun to do something with others. Besides that, she liked Leslie pretty much. She always had been nice to her, which was very different from most other friends of her siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. I know for sure I got some food in here somewhere!\" Her Grandmother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle looked outside in the meantime. You could barely see outside. It was still snowing very hard. The white flocks were covering everything outside like a white blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's snowing really hard,\" May Belle said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You know what? I'll call your parents. You can't go outside in this weather. I will just tell them you can stay here for another day, or longer,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have school tomorrow,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I know where the school is.

Just eat until you have had enough. If you want some more, there's always more,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle carried the two boxes and bags over to the T.V,  put them down, turned on the T.V, and watched cartoons while she stuffed herself with the treats.</span></div></div>",

SHe was definitely having fun with gaining the small amount of weight she had so far. She was also just as happy to see that Jesse liked it as well. However, she began to wonder what would happen if Jesse and her ever split. If that did happen, all she would be is a fat girl who would have a hard time finding someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about this, Leslie stopped kissing him as her face slowly filled with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Jesse said as he noticed Leslie's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about things,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of things?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, suppose I continue to gain weight. Suppose I get really fat, and then something happens with us that would make us break up. It just scares me,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? I would never do that,\" Jesse said in a positive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we know, Jesse? We are still very young. You never know what can happen,\" Leslie told Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly it. You never know what can happen. I could propose to you someday. We could live in a nice house with a ton of land. We could have so many children. We could grow old together and be the happiest people alive. You never know. You never know what life will bring. But the one thing I do know, and always will know, is that I will always think you are beautiful, kind, and and I couldn't imagine being here without you,\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Leslie felt herself exploding on the inside from such touching emotions from Jesse. All that he had just told her was the most reassuring thing she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel exactly the same way, Jesse,\" Leslie said to Jesse as they both started to get up and kiss one more time. Leslie looked outside the window seeing the snow. Even though it was cold out and there was a lot, she still wanted to play in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get on our snow stuff. You, me, and May Belle should try and play out in the snow,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could try if you want to,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left the room, Leslie stopped Jesse at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just wondering though now on one thing. The weight feels really great on me, and I know we talked about it earlier. Would you ever want me to be at May Belle's level? If so, I could get started now,\" Leslie wondered as she told Jesse. In reality, Leslie knew that she would gain as much as they both wanted her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse then closed his eyes and tried to imagine it in his head.</span></div></div>",

He must admit that he liked the idea of having a fat Leslie but he did't wanna do anything she did't liked. Even if he would like it more. Besides it was Leslie's body they were talking about. Not his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't really have to if you don't want to.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets first get those first pounds on my frame and after that we'll see what happens.

That could be funny.\"Leslie said a giggled softly. \"Now do you still gonna get our snow stuff or do wanna wait for tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle was busy munching on the cookies with already a empty box and bag next to her. She was a bit surprised how much food her tummy could hold. More then she suspected that's for sure. Perhaps she could eat more because of her desire to gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey May Belle. Come on we go outside to play in the snow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside. No way. Thank you I'm fine here inside. Nice and warm. I don't like it when it's so cold. Besides it's snowing really hard. You can hardly do anything . You can barely see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on it will be fun. Our parents gonna pick us up in a few hours so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not. Grandma thought the weather was to bad to drive so she called mommy and said that we could stay another night. Then she drives us to school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we have school tomorrow..\" Leslie said and grinned. \"With so much snow we'll probably have snow free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle looked excited out of the window. She never had snow free before but with how hard it was snowing now there was a good chance she would have. She burped softly and and patted her fat belly and smiled feeling the soft layer of fat on her Belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can go if you want but I'm staying in here. It's way to bad weather outside  for me to go out. Also much too cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on. You have nothing to worry about. You have a huge layer of fat to keep you warm. That's on of the reason animals get fat. To stay warm in the weather. Other's get fat so they won't starve during hibernation. After they wake up they're pretty thin since they used up all that fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you're right or not I'm staying inside where it's nice and warm!\" May Belle said and turned to the T.V screen, and continued to munch on cookies. </span></div></div>",

Maybe you can use May Belle's hat and gloves in the meantime,\" Jesse reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked in the closet and saw May Belle's purple and blue hat with the pink puff ball on top and tassels that had puffs on them along with the matching gloves.

The snow flakes were falling so fast that it looked like someone had burst open a pillow that had millions of feathers inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do?\" Jesse asked Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could make a snow man, a snow fort, or just lay in the snow,\" Leslie said with a huge grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could do all of those,\" Jesse grinned back as they ran out into the yard more.</span></div></div>",

I think my parents don't want her to gain anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that she gained a lot of the weight at my house.\" Leslie said. \"About every day when we came back from Terbithia she came over too my house to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how she gained weight so fast.

She raised her own kids and now her kids raise their own kids. She say that our parents can raise us how they want. It's not for her to decide what's best for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can understand that. But she can advice your parents right?\" Leslie asked. \"They are her children after all. At least... one of them. She's worried about her grandchildren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps but if she does tell them to need to let May Belle gain weight they might think our grandma started to become demented and then we can't visit anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment he got hit by a snowball.

Both got so caught up in what they were doing that Jesse forget that he was worried about what his parents would do about May Belle's weight gain. At least for now but he knew that it would be too long before their parents thought she was way too fat and needed to diet now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat snow!\" Leslie yelled and threw a snowball right in Jesse's face. \"Yeah! Bulls eye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were playing in the snow May Belle was just being lazy. All the food was inside her big round belly. She knew she lately became pretty lazy but she liked her new lifestyle. She focused her attention to the cartoons on the T.V and brushed some of the crumbs on her shirt on her hand and licked them up. She giggled. She was really turned into a butter- ball and she liked it just like Jesse and Leslie. She wondered what her other family members would think. She knew what her parents thought but her other siblings. Well Joyce Ann was still a bit too young to really have a opinion. Her other siblings... they thought people needed to be thin to be beautiful. Like those stick girls in fashion magazines. That you needed to starve yourself to look good.

In between her eating of Samoa Girl Scout cookies, she looked at Leslie and noticed how she was wearing some of her snow gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that used to be hers, but she still looks cute in it,\" May Belle reasoned with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen looking at Leslie in her older clothes, which were now May Belle's, she wondered how Leslie looked as a younger child. From the clothing that she got, she assumed that she was skinny and athletic. Then again, it seemed that most kids go through a chubby stage. Even Jesse went through a chubby stage around four years ago where he was majorly affected by Grandma's cooking. This made May Belle wonder if this was Leslie's first experience with weight gain or not. May Belle began to remember the days that were not too long ago for her. About two years ago, May Belle went through a chubby stage as she gained weight and looked bigger. However, as she grew, she got smaller and became a skinnier child for at least a year. After that, she gained weight gain which lead her to her current status. By looking at Leslie, May Belle definitely understood that childhood habits could set how your body develops for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, May Belle?\" Her Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just eating and watching them outside,\" May Belle responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like they are having fun. You should join them for a short bit,\" Her Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Grandma, I am worried,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Her Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have gained a lot of weight over the weekend. Mom and Dad will not like it and they are not as accepting as you are. I don't know what I will do when I get back,\" May Belle said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in all honesty, her Grandma had no clue as well. May Belle was getting big, and she can't control May Belle's parents and their parenting styles. The only thing she could think of is having May Belle live with her, but that was still an idea that could not be determined first. She needed to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, let me see what I can do. If you love your body, they will have to get used to it. Be you and don't focus on other's opinions. Okay?\" Her Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" May Belle said with a fat grin as she felt more pride with being fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go outside for a short bit. The least you can do is sit in the snow and make a snow chair out of it. I know Leslie has some of your stuff on, but Leslie's winter gear is all set now. You could use hers of we can try looking through old clothes. What do you say?\" Her Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle was liking the idea of making a snow chair. That, and she could try on some more of Leslie's cute snow gear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a lot of dust everywhere and spider webs. May Belle must admit she was kind of afraid for spiders. But grandma calmly looked at labels on the boxes. softly mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pants, socks... Ah here it is. Winter stuff.\" She said and picked up a old box and blew the dust of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the box. It was full with stuff to wear during the winter. Winter hats, scarf's and mittens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From who is this?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it used to be from your mother... or probably your aunt. Maybe both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle fast looked out some nice stuff and waddled to her room to look for some warmer clothing for when she was going outside. She pulled of her pants and shirt but just when she was walking through the closet she saw her self in the mirror. She looked at herself and noticed how good she looked. She knew very well how many girls at home were standing hours in front of their mirror. Just like her older sisters at home. Mostly those girls were a few years older then her but still she admired her body. She also pulled of her underwear and looked at her body naked. She really was a fat girl. A butterball. She liked it very much but she wished other people liked it too. But she knew very well others did't. Except for grandma, Jesse and Leslie she did't knew anyone who liked it. Why was life so complicated. softly she poked with a finger in her fat. She giggled and liked it and started to look at her entire body. How her neck was slowly disappearing.. How her cheeks were pink and puffy. Her arms that were flabby and there was a start that her upper arms were swallowing up her under arms. She even had boobs. All right it was only 100% pure fat but still it was some sort of a start. But her belly was the biggest. Big juicy rolls of fat. Softly she let her hands slide over her fat rolls exploring her body. She liked it very much. Then her butt who was started to hang over the edge of each chair and her thunder thighs. She must admit she liked that name Thunder thighs and that's what they were. She saw clearly cellulite on her thighs until her ankles.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I look fantastic. How can people not like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was still pretty young and was't really thinking about a relation yet she thought that boys should fight to get a girl as her. So beautiful. Covered in squishy, warm fat, As soft if silk. Who could't want that. She knew a lot of people would't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair. Why could't I be born in a world were fat is seen as beautiful. Were parents would like it to fatten their kids up until they are fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are places where they do such things.\" She suddenly heard her grandmothers voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fast pulled the blanket over her body and saw how her grandmother entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they really force their kids to become fat. By hurting them forcing them that way to let them eat huge amounts of food. So much that they some times even vomit and some even force them (if they do vomit) to eat their own vomit. That's seen like a deed of love so your child is fat and looks beautiful. Not so nice now is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that.\" May Belle mumbled.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I was just curious,\" May Belle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are some places that are camps where people go to get fat. I heard stories about camp counselors being too involved in stuffing the children. For that, they really stuffed them and made it not fun. I don't think that camp was too far away. Maybe a few hours from here,\" her Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle began to think in all different directions. A camp where all they want to do is make you fat? That sounded fun in her eyes. But then, May Belle began to think about the fact that they stuff people to the point where it hurts. She wondered if that was even worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds painful,\" May Belle responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does. There's also another story I heard about parents stuffing their children that much. One of the kids ended up being around seven hundred pounds before they turned twenty-one,\" her Grandma continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least the parents wanted the kids fatter,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but that much pressure could be dangerous,\" her Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish mine could let me become what I want,\" May Belle said somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in time, dear. Let me just think up of something,\" said her Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it sounded like painful times, May Belle began to wonder if she wanted to try a fat camp at some point. She didn't want to do anything else but that. Her mind was still thinking in many different directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get you changed and in snow gear,\" her Grandma said.</span></div></div>",

So it will all be fine.\" Her grandmother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly May Belle waddled outside. It was still snowing pretty hard. She walked into the garden and suddenly saw Leslie and Jesse who were building a pretty big snowman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Looks good. Now all we need is a hat, a carrot and some pieces of coal for his smile and eyes. Perhaps a scarf  and  a pipe. Those will also look nice.\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandma does't smoke pipe. My grandfather did't smoke. So I guess you won't find a pipe.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's okay. I mean a pipe would be nice but it's not really important. But the coal and the carrot are important. And a hat and scarf would also be nice. Does your grandmother have those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure she does. A carrot is in the kitchen and you can find some coal next to the fire place and I found a box with winter clothing. I'm sure there's also a scarf. and I bet we can also find a hat there.\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Belle? So you finally decide to come outside.\" Jesse said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Hee Jesse I heard there are some places were young girls are fattened up. They force people to get fat!\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they used to do that In Nigeria. There fat people were seen as beautiful.\" Leslie said while she was leaning against the wall. \"But it's been banned by the government. Too bad in one way. But just because it's banned does't want too say they don't do it anymore. Just like killing people is also against the law but there was a guy that killed two woman last week. So just because it is against the law does't want to say people don't do it. The ones who do it live far away from the city. They still think that fat woman are beautiful. But they do it wrong. They force them to eat. Also against their will by hurting them. Sometimes feeding them so much they need to vomit and after that still forces them to eat. May Belle being fat is all right, but the way they do it is wrong. Really forcing little girls to eat  by hurting them. That's just the wrong way to fatten people up. Believe me. You would't like it. It is just terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do parents do it to their children?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they still think fat woman are beautiful. So the people who fatten girls up, many times their mother and grandmother, are convinced they doing her a favor. After some time. But those kids don't even have a choice. We choose. They don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma told me there are some camps not far from here were people go to get fat. It sounds the same.\" May Belle mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it is the same way... but it's the wrong way. You don't want to eat until  you vomit. Or being so full you feel like you would explode?. Leslie said.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I guess not. Being fattened up sounds fun and all but being hurt so you will eat and all sounds terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it is. We gain because we want to, by eating a lot. But just as much if we want. Without all the vomit and hurting.\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee girls I don't want to ruin your talk but are we gonna get that carrot and coal. Else we have a sad snowman who's blind, mute and can't smell. That's a bit sad is't it?'  </span></div></div>",

They kept their snow stuff on as their Grandma acknowledged them all being inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys done out there already?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. We just came in here for a quick minute to get some stuff for the snowman. We need to make him look the best that it can be,\" Jesse said to his Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids began to look through all the winter stuff. They finally pulled out a pink scarf that had snow flakes all over it. Then, they found a hat from the 1980's that was multicolored, looked like a beanie, and had the biggest puff ball on top that they had ever seen. They all approved on what they found and continued on until Leslie hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, could you guys do the rest without me for a few minutes? I need to go to the bathroom while we are in here,\" Leslie said while she began to shake and make it obvious she had to pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I think May Belle and I have it. We will wait for you by where we came in after we get the stuff,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Leslie headed to the rest room while the other two went by the fireplace to get some coal forte snowman. After that, the next stop was the kitchen where they needed to get a carrot for the nose of the snowman. As they looked into the refrigerator, they grabbed a huge carrot when suddenly, May Belle's food senses kicked into gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, look! Grandma made a huge bowl of chocolate pudding!\" May Belle said as she looked at the huge bowl that was a little bigger than a normal mixing bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum! I know you love pudding,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jesse got a wicked idea. He thought about stuffing, or in this case, force feeding, May Belle this bowl of pudding. He had never forcefully stuffed his sister, especially to make her so obese. And since Leslie was in the bathroom, now would be a great time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the start she might think it might be a little strange that she also went to the grandmother of a friend but she really liked Jesse's grandmother. Thanks to her Jesse finally found out that he liked fat girls what also made a change in her life. To be totally honest the idea of gaining weight made her a excited. She lifted her shirt until just under her chest and felt. There was a small bump probably from breakfast. But you would't really call it chubby or fat and that was just what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those people are always saying it's hard to lose weight. Well gaining is't that easy either.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was impatient. She just started gaining but still she hoped there was some sort of progress. But it seemed she needed to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well I'm still pretty young. I've time enough to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a bit thinking about the fact that May Belle was several years younger then her but also several pounds heavier. If she continued to gain just as fast if Leslie she would always be fatter then her. <br>\r\nMay Belle pulled her into this. She started to gain and she helped her. If May Belle would't start to gain or if she would't have helped her then this all probably have't happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flushed the toilet but before she pulled up her pants she looked a her butt. Would she gain some weight in there. She heard some boys liked girls with big butts. Well what did it matter. She only wanted Jesse like boyfriend. For a moment she lifted her shirt to look at her chest. Would she also gain in there? She sure hoped so. She always wanted some bigger boobs. Her mom Always told her they would grow in time. But what was wrong by helping them a little. She noticed May Belle also had them. Fine it was only fat but still she had them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I really need to do my best to gain then.\" She said with a smile and a last look on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she lowered her shirt and pulled up her pants.

She gave her face a look of horror as she noticed she had her hair all messed up. Immediately, she grabbed her hat and decided to place it back on until she was able to take a shower. May Belle noticed that Leslie did this and decided to do the same thing just like a little sister copying her older sister. Both the girls smiled at each other. Jesse took off all of his stuff. He saw what the girls were doing, but decided not to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the kids went to the table and quickly sat down.

Enjoy!\" She said with a smile as she walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids began to dig into the food. Jesse ate how he normally did by grabbing a few things and seeing what he could eat. The girls, on the other hand, grabbed as many things they could fit on their plate as possible. May Belle grabbed some chicken and slammed the whole thing into her mouth and tried to suck the meat and grease off of the bone. Leslie got a bowl of pudding, slammed her whole face into it, and began to slurp. Jesse looked up at Leslie. He was in total shock that she was pigging out this much, but watching her eat like this turned him on a little bit as he felt himself quiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept on eating different kinds of food. After Jesse ate two plates of food, he basically stopped eating to watch the other two girls stuff their face like wild animals. Jesse looked at May Belle and noticed how happy she was eating the food. It seemed like she was beginning to look like a round ball from sitting down and having all of that fat. Her pants made it seem that it could not hold her fat too much longer. But Jesse did like how fat she was becoming. One of these days, he wanted to have a feeding session with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse then looked over at Leslie who was eating like a champion. She was pigging out so much not just for herself, but for him too. With all of that food, Leslie was eating like May Belle. He laughed at himself as he began to wonder what if Leslie started to act like May Belle. All he wanted to see though was for Leslie and his sister not to just become fatter, but into the furthest land called obesity. </span></div></div>",

Then he remembered his sister went to Leslie everyday to eat there, and after that she could still eat at home. <br>\r\nLeslie also continued eating and he must admit he liked that also.

There was just one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna force feed me? Well I don't think you need force to feed me.

She wondered what Jesse was planning. She thought about May Belly. Would her pants also split if she ate enough. They probably would but that might take a while. Why did she needed to wait so long before she saw result. Suddenly she giggled thinking about the fact that most people thought the opposite. <br>\r\nShe heard footsteps and Jesse walked back in holding their scarfs in his hands. She looked at him trying to figure out what he was planning to do. Jess walked over to her and kissed her and wrapped the scarf around her torso just under her breasts.

Leslie opened her mouth and Jesse pushed the spoon in her mouth. Leslie did't understood that even if it was by force she kind of liked it. That was weird. In just a few days she was planning to gain and liked it to be force fed. Life was strange.<br>\r\nJesse must admit that he also liked this idea of feeding someone by force.

Stuffing Leslie was a gift. But to force feed both of them? That was a whole big package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Here, keep on stuffing Leslie. I'm going to find something for you,\" Jesse said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle grabbed a spoonful of food and continued to diligently stuff Leslie. Leslie always looked so cute, especially when she was eating to get fat. May Belle saw Leslie's hat tassels and tied them together. She did this to measure her double chin and see how much she had gained. According to this, the amount was significant as there was a start to a double chin. Leslie was really packing it on just like May Belle was. Leslie smiled when May Belle did this, and Leslie wanted to see how fat they both could get. Finally, May Belle turned around and noticed Jesse entering the room again. He had a few more colorful scarves as well as a bowl of pudding they had seen their Grandma make earlier in a huge mixing bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to be stuffed too, May Belle?\" Jesse asked with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle smiled back at her brother and nodded as she sat in the chair next to Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse started to wrap around the scarf across May Belle's chest and belly. Jesse wasn't paying attention at the fact that May Belle was laughing for a few minutes. He then realized why: when he put the scarf around her, he was stroking her soft belly, which made her giggle. Jesse liked the feeling and stroked it more, but then he stopped. This was his sister and he didn't want to act weird around her because of her weight. But then again, it felt so good to touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he tried to avoid it and begin stuffing both of the girls. </span></div></div>",

They ate and ate and both felt kind of happy. <br>\r\nJesse looked at May Belly. She was a really fat girl. A real butter ball. She gained all over her body but her belly gained without a doubt most of the weight. He looked at Leslie and wondered where she would gain the most. All over like may belle, in her belly or maybe in her thighs. The thought that maybe the weight would come in her chest made him happy. Well not all the weight perhaps he also would like it to have weight in the other area's too but he must admit he would like it if Leslie got bigger boobs and after all she had the right age for them.<br>\r\nLeslie looked at him and grinned and he saw pieces of food between her teeth and she opened her mouth again wide and May Belle did the same and he pushed a spoon full with food in the mouth of each girl. Even while it was a bit of hard work he must admit he liked it to stuff both of this girls. He hoped Leslie would gain soon. He had liked it to stroke the belly of May Belle but she was his sister and that was a bit strange but doing it with Leslie was no problem. At least they loved each other. Was stroking her belly not the same like kissing or cuddling, or at least something you like to do to show that you loved someone else. He was sure Leslie would like it too. But even now she was still pretty thin. It might took a while before she gained enough weight. Especially with walking to Terabithia every day. But at the other hand he did't wanted to give that up. But perhaps he could cut down on going over there. Perhaps only during weekends and on Wednesday. But if they were there they could of course have a big picnic. After all Leslie was the queen and a queen need good (and if she wanted a lot of) food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two doing okay?\" Jesse asked just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I m doing great! Now go on feeding me. I'm starving over here.\" May Belle yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sis. You're not starving. You're not even close to starving. You have enough fat to live some time without food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps... but I'm still HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNGRY!!!!\" May Belle yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse fast continued the stuffing of the two girls so his sister would shut up and also because he liked doing it. He wondered what their parents would think about her weight gain here. He was sure they would't be happy. He looked out side. It was still snowing hard. You could hardly see outside. Jesse wondered how their snowman was doing.<br>\r\nLeslie felt how her belly got hard stuffed with food. She could't wait until it would all be soft squishy warm fat. It would take some time before she was the size she wanted to be but she would do her best to get there. One way or another.<br>\r\nJesse kept feeding both girls and outside it was still snowing so hard that it looked like it would never stop.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Just like a older sister she never had. Well she had two older sisters but Leslie acted more like a bigger sister to her then they ever did. She wondered or they even noticed her weight gain.

With Jesse's help, they put May Belle down on her back and started to unzip the outfit. Jesse tried to reach in and get May Belle's body out. As soon as he reached, he realized that he had grabbed onto May Belle's majorly fat thigh. He liked the feeling, but quickly backed away as he found her hand and pulled her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so much fun!\" May Belle said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it was,\" Jesse replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess, here it goes,\" Leslie said as she started to get into the suit. She had to bend over to try and get down, but when she did that, Jesse had saw her bigger butt, which made him feel hard. Quickly, he had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back,\" he said as he went upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked a each other and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he really enjoys this,\" May Belle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Hey, it's better that he does than doesn't,\" Leslie pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jesse came down with even more blankets and heavy puffy winter jackets. He began to put it in Leslie's costume as she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she get more stuffing?\" May Belle asked jealously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she is taller than you. She needs more,\" Jesse said as he was just hiding the fact that he wanted her even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the stuff in, they zipped up the costume and helped Leslie up. She had a hard time maintaining her balance on her pretty dissolved looking feet. She fell back and landed on her butt, which really made her look like an immobile ball of fat. Jesse was going insane with how hot she looked.</span></div></div>",

It was still pretty hard for her to move, but she really did enjoy the feeling of being so fat and constrained even though it was just a costume. Jesse noticed her excitement along with Leslie. He was glad to see his sister this happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be this fat?\" Jesse asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! It feels so wonderful,\" May Belle said as she tried to move her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really look like a ball,\" Leslie said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of wish I were more like one,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I got an idea!\" Leslie said as she quickly got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed upstairs, Jesse enjoyed seeing his fatter liking sister more and wondered what Leslie would look like in the suit. He really wanted to make the suit even bigger for Leslie if that was possible. Finally, after a few minutes, Leslie came back with two pairs of the same color gloves as the costume, tape, and two puffy tassel hats. She then went up to May Belle and began to put on the gloves. She then got tape and taped her hands to the suit so it made her look like she had no hands. After that, she did the same thing to May Belle's feet to make her fall on her round butt. Finally, she went up to May Belle's head and put the hat on as deep as she could. May Belle's eyes still poked out so she could see, but it did help her look more like a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may try that next,\" Leslie grinned to Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, May Belle tried to roll around just like a ball. She started to slowly go around the room as she was having so much fun. Finally, after a minute or so, she landed on her back and was stuck in place.</span></div></div>",

My turn to look like a ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle looked a bit sad since she liked being a ball. She sighed and looked at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Leslie if you want to to do this too you first need to help me out. I would like to help but I can barely move.\" May Belle said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie and Jesse walked over to her and zipped the costume open and first removed a lot of the stuffing before the were able to remove his fat sister. He smiled remembering that some time ago before she started gaining he was able to carry his sister. Now it would be impossible. She was even heavier then him now.<br>\r\nMay Belle was a bit said since she now felt herself a bit... tiny. Even thin. Just a few seconds ago she was so fat she was the shape of a ball and now she felt kind of thin and she hated that. she did't want to be thin. She wanted to be fat. A very fat, fat, fat girl. A girl that was morbidly obese. A girl that looked like a ball but then without stuffing but who looked like a ball because she was so fat. She smiled weakly and promised herself she was gonna look that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee May Belle can you help a hand?\" Jesse asked waking her up from her daydreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm I think I need some more stuffing for you.\" Jesse said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she get more stuffing them me?\" May Belle asked a bit jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's taller then you. So she needs more to look like a ball.\" Jess answered while he went upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides that you already have a lot of stuffing already on you May Belle. I'm a twig compared to you. Just look at you. All those beautiful rolls of fat on your body I don't have those. I need stuffing for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cheered May Belle up a bit. Partly also because it was true. She did had more of the stuffing on her. Realizing this she did't complain when Jesse returned with the blankets and pillows from their bed's and stuffed Leslie's costume. <br>\r\nJesse finally zipped the costume up and with The help of May Belle he lifted Leslie on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Leslie tell me. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I love not being able to move,\" Leslie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now try it as more of a ball,\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then did what she did to May Belle before. He got a pair of gloves and slipped them on her hands. He then taped them to her body so she was unable to move them. After that, he then got her feet and began to tape them to her round body. After all that was done, he grabbed the other tassel hat and pulled it as fat down over her head as he can. Her eyes, nose, and lips barely poked out, but she did look like a round ball. With the way he stuffed her, it looked like she had folds on her stomach and huge boobs. Immediately, he got hard. He couldn't tell from the look of her face, but she was feeling just as satisfied too. Suddenly, May Belle began to head for the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go eat I think. I'll be around,\" May Belle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wanting to get away to eat and get fatter, but also to try and stuff her clothes with whatever else she could find. Jesse didn't complain as he had alone time with Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your thoughts?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

She giggled like a little girl.<br>\r\nJess bend for over until he found her face and softly and tender pushed his lips on her mouth and they kissed and share a moment of passion noticing nothing else except themselves and stuffing. A lot of stuffing. Both kids were happy with this and enjoyed every moment of it while the kissed and cuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle in the meanwhile walked upstairs. Strange... not too long ago she was stuffed with food and now... well she was't really hungry but she could eat something. For sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my stomach stretched from being so stuffed each day.\" She said with a giggle and a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly walked to her grandmother who was busy looking at some old photo's from when she was young. May Belle went sitting on a chair next to her and looked at them. Some were in black and white and some in color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look this was your mother when she was young.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy was kind of... chubby, when she was young.\" May Belle said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she was. But then she became a teenager and people did their best to stay thin. Your mother too. But she managed to become and stay thin. Even after five pregnancies. Look here's your mother as a teenager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mom? She looks ridiculous!\" May Belle said laughing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the way people dressed in those days. However I must admit that it sometimes drove me crazy. But did you want to ask me something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah do you have something to eat for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't possibly be hungry.\" Grandma said , but with a smile proud at how much she was eating. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Well I'm not really hungry but I just want something to munch on.\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma handed her a box of chocolate cookies. May Belle fast ripped it open and started to stuff her face with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you kids doing down there anyway. I heard a lot of noise and laughing seemed like you had a lot of fun. When you're my age it's always nice to hear something funny. What were you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we put on a suit and after that stuffed it with pillow's, blanket's and stuff until we looked like a ball. It was a lot of fun.\" May Belle sighed suddenly. \"But it might take while before I reach that size. I like being so fat and I do wanna become so fat like a ball but... I don't think my parents would let me become so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure there's a solution for that.\"  Grandma said softly and turned on the T.V and watched the news. \"Hee May Belle listen to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to the heavy snow today people are still advised to stay home today and tomorrow too. School are also closed tomorrow. It is not sure or schools will be open at Tuesday. We will have to wait and see how the weather is. Back to you Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no school tomorrow! So... we can stay another day?\" May Belle asked excited. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Perhaps. I of course have to ask your parents... but I'm fine with it.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leslie was not acting like herself as she was in heaven with her body stuffed, her arms and legs tied to her body, and her hat pulled down over her head. All of this made Jesse happy and excited. He wished that he could just unzip her clothes and explore her fat, but there wouldn't be as much as he wanted. This is when he wanted to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second,\" Jesse said as he went out of the room for a minute while Leslie acted surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like it?\" Leslie asked in a disappointed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually the opposite. I want more,\" Jesse said as he came back a minute later with more blankets and clothes to stuff into the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuff me! I want more,\" Leslie said with a satisfied smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Jesse unzipped her and began to stuff even more into her outfit. Quickly, the outfit began to change form as Leslie began to give the appearance of a ball into a huge blob of \"fat.\" She looked like a tied up blob wearing a winter hat, but both kids were enjoying it. Leslie especially was since she knew this would be the one time she could enjoy this for a long time. Jesse went along with this since after this weekend, he could never do these things as much since it could get out that they are dating. That was why they wanted to enjoy it. Finally, after a while, Jesse zipped up Leslie's outfit with much resistance and struggle, but found complete satisfaction with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretend I was naked now and you were too. I want you to do sondthing I would be ready for. Maybe even tonight,\" Leslie said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse could not believe it. Leslie hinted at the two making love. He knew he would be ready, but he wanted to make sure she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that, Leslie?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just practice now. It would be fun,\" Leslie challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jesse didn't need anything more. He got on top of her stuffed body, grabbed tight to her, and began to shift his hips. It was more pleasureable for him, even though they actually were not making love, but Leslie moved along, making it more exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, they both began to move faster and enjoy each other more and more.</span></div></div>",

You were't laughing.\" May Belle, said reminding how hard she laughed if she was tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he tried to tickle me. Did't worked because all that stuffing around me. It looks like I'm the size of a ball but most of it is just stuffing. sheets and blankets... it not really part of my body. I can't feel with it.\" Leslie said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle nodded slowly. It did make sense. She was't sure the both of them told the truth but also knew that if they both were making up a lie they would't tell her the truth. But perhaps it was pretty innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I got down here to tell you that we can stay here a day longer. School's are closed tomorrow thanks to the heavy snow. So grandma called our parents and we can stay longer. They agree it's saver to wait until the heavy snow is over.. By the way we're having fun here right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I have.\" Leslie said. \"How about you Jesse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a great time.

See you soon.\" May Belle said and walked upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too close for comfort.\" Jesse said. \"But about what you said. You said you were ready. So you really wanna do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you wanna do it?\" Leslie asked while turning her head trying to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I want... I just was't sure if you wanted.

He reached for Leslie's hat, but she put a hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to get hot?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I keep on getting it back on for some stupid reason.

Well, dinner is ready,\" Jesse's Grandma yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, May Belle came from the living room and waddled over as fast as she could until she sat at her spot.

Quickly, the girls started to tear into the food as if they were never fed before. May Belle went for fried chicken immediately while Leslie went for greasy mashed potatoes and gravy among other things. Jesse, on the other hand, took what he could find in front of him, which at the moment, was turkey. Jesse couldn't help but look at Leslie. She had gravy all over her face as she began to smile at Jesse. Even though she was pigging out, Jesse couldn't help but smile back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" he said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly smiled as if butterflies were exploding inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too,\" she said in a calmed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle didn't even notice this because she was still devouring her food.</span></div></div>",

The boy also enjoyed his food and enjoyed seeing the two girls eat. May Belle and Leslie both ate until they were stuffed to the brim and Jesse must say her was surprised how much the two girls ate. Well he knew his sister could eat a lot but he was really surprised how much Leslie could eat. She just started gaining but was already eating like a fat girl.  It made him happy, but he was surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seemed you really enjoyed my food.\" Grandma said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" Mumbled Leslie rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally!\" May Belle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's time for you three to go to bed. Hurry up!\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse walked to his room so the girls could use the bathroom first. He was glad so now he could think a bit. He was pretty nervous. He really wanted to have sex with Leslie but it was his first time. At the other hand it also would be Leslie's first time so he did't have to be so worried about that. He also knew they were pretty young. He heard sometimes from those teenagers who got a kid. But how big was the chance that would happen?  He did't know but he did't thought he need to worry too much about that. But he could't stop thinking at how it would be. He heard about it and it sounded like it must be something wonderful. He rolled on his belly while thoughts kept flying through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime May Belle and Leslie were both in the bathtub and admired their fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Belly feels so hard. Like a bag of wet cement.\" May Belle moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you just ate. Don't worry. Tomorrow the food is digested and it feels soft and squishy again.\" Leslie told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad you also want to gain and you helped me gain. I would't have gotten this size without your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I could help. I'm also glad you did it or else Jesse would have never admit to himself he liked fat girls. Then I would't try to gain weight now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange if you think about it. Is't it. First I just eat because I was hungry and I wanted to eat more and the more I ate the fatter I got and I liked it. But I'm busy for some time. It might take a while before you're really a fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait squirt. When I want something I can really go for it. I also like a challenge and a competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed May Belle wiser to keep her mouth shut. She blinked just a few times and slide a bit deeper in the warm water. Now Leslie had time to think about tonight. Thinking the same things like Jesse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the girls were done brushed their teeth and changed in their pajamas. However May Belle's belly poked out between her shirt and pants. Both kids though it looked adorable  at her.<br>\r\nJesse fast went to the bathroom while the girls went into their bedroom.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I promise, for breakfast tomorrow, I will rip out of this pajama shirt,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright. Goodnight!\" Leslie said as they headed to sleep. However, Leslie stayed up until a half hour later. She rose out of bed and began to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to change for this. What should I do? Get into a really big fat suit for Jesse's pleasure?\" Leslie thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she quietly opened her closet and saw what she had: a white two piece swimsuit and her white pom Pom accent tassel winter hat that matched perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or give this a white winter land theme for me?\" Leslie contemplated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of staying in bed, Jesse grew nervous, but excited for the first time in a while.

She thought about going in a fat suit but if they did make love they would have to take their clothes out and perhaps Jesse would be disappointed how skinny she was without the fat suit. In her Bikini he saw what he got. It showed her body not letting it look fatter or thinner then it really was. This was her body... for now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hi there are you. For a moment I thought you would't come.\" Jesse mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to wait until your sister was asleep. I could't tell her what we were going to do.\" Leslie said.  \"Did you really thought I would't come. You should know better then that. I always loved a adventure and this might be the biggest adventure ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I'm a bit nervous. I never have done this before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and with how many boys did you think I made love with?\" Leslie asked scornful with her hands in her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I understand it's you first time too. Are't you a bit nervous?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? I never have been more nervous like this. I just know how to hide it. She said while she went sitting on his bed on her knees and took Jesse's face and kissed him.<br>\r\nJesse crawled from under his blanket and went sitting across Leslie also on his knees. Again they kissed and Jesse pulled of Leslie's hat. Leslie's hands slowly pulled of his pajama shirt and Jesse put his hands on Leslie's hips and slowly traveled up until he reached the upper piece of her swimsuit. He slowly removed it and tossed it aside and softly felt her small boobs. Both kids pushed their naked upper bodies up against each other and kissed again. Jesse felt leslie's hand grabbing his pajama pants and he did the same with the bottom part of her swimsuit both kids curled their bodies to make it easier for the other to remove their clothes. Jesse looked at Leslie. God he loved her so much. Then he saw her naked with just the start of a belly what made him really hard. Leslie let fall herself on her back on Jesse's bed and spread her legs wide and looked up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jesse take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse crawled on top of her and when he finally made love to her both let out soft moaning sounds of pleasure. For both it felt great. They heard the first time must be with somebody special. Both could't think of anybody more special then the other.<br>\r\nThen they both were lying next to each other. Both sweating and breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... how was... that for you?\" Jesse asked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!... I loved it... You too?\" Leslie answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... wanna do it again?\"  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Even though it was painful for her at first, she had enjoyed this new experience and relationship. She saw as Jesse came up to her closer again. She opened up her legs and let Jesse back in. This time, the kids kept it up for longer than the last as they kept on kissing one another. At times, Leslie had to back out of the kissing as she moaned in pleasure. Jesse liked it, but he seemed nervous since he didn't want his family to wake up at all. He didn't want to have to explain what was going on at the moment to them, especially the situation itself to his Grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, the kids had finished yet again as they panted and grabbed one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets better each time it seems,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really does.

You know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jesse said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I am on the pill. My parents put me on it to help me out. My mom went on it when she was really young. So I know what to do. As long as I take it on time,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you do. I mean, if it happened, I would be here for you and us.

She was still a young kid who needed her sleep she did't notice that Leslie left. She was having way too much fun in her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dream May Belle walked over the street. Just in her pajamas bare feet. But her feet did't felt cold. It was warm. Their was nice sun shining. She closed her eyes and let the sun shine on her face. It felt nice however she felt very hungry. She opened her eyes and blinked a few times. Everything changed. Everything was totally made of food. The cars, the houses, the trees. She did't saw any humans but like in many dreams you have did't thought anything of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" She yelled and looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke of a branch of a tree and wolfed it down but was still hungry. She grabbed a entire car and fast wolfed it down. She was amazed how fast the car was gone. But she still was very hungry. But she did noticed her belly was bigger. She grabbed another car and wolfed it down too and noticed she got fatter but her hunger did't got any less.<br>\r\nThe young girl explored this new world further and swallowed down a entire tree. She ate every scrap of it even the roots. <br>\r\nThen she saw the house. walked over to it and nibbled a bit on the wall wondering how it taste. It tasted terrific. Now she did't just nibble but started eating. She wolfed down the entire wall and then saw the living room. She fast started to eat every piece of furniture. First the couch, the chairs and the T.V.<br>\r\nWith everything she ate she got more fatter. Her thighs were as big as tires. Rolls were hanging from her pillow like arms But her belly was the biggest. it bugled out in front of her like it the was a car in it. What was the case she thought. <br>\r\nEvery piece of furniture went past her lips and found it's way to her belly. When she saw the fridge she just swallowed the entire fridge down in one gulp. She ate the other chairs, tables, beds, closets, drawers, couch everything she could find. She even ate the knifes, and razorblades without wondering what would happen.<br>\r\nShe fast ate the rest of the house and still got fatter and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna eat everything!\" May Belly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wolfed down everything she saw. Houses, trees roads. Entire forests were eaten by this growing fat girl, houses, villages and finally entire cities were devoured by her endless appetite. Growing fatter and fatter with each thing she ate. Lakes were drowned, mountains got eaten and finally she had eaten the entire earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she suddenly woke  up with a big grin on her face that faded when she found out it had only been a dream. She felt very thin and tiny after that dream. even while she was perhaps the fattest kid in her class. But in her dream she was so incredible fat.<br>\r\n She sighed and suddenly saw Leslie's bed was empty. She wondered where she was. Perhaps to the bathroom. But after waiting for five minutes Leslie still was't back. <br>\r\nBare feet she got out of bed and walked out her room. Her belly that poked out between her pants and shirt let out a huge growl. That hunger in her dream seemed to have been real. She wondered what to do.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Opening up pantry after pantry, she kept on seeing a variety of snacks. With each grasp, she began to eat like they were enemies she had to conquer. Going through a container of Oreo's, nutter butters, whoopie pies, and nutty bars, May Belle opened up the refrigerator to see what else she was craving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" She asked herself as she grabbed a big bowl from inside the unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into it, May Belle couldn't believe her eyes: it was a whole bowl of liquid chocolate. May Belle already knew why it was tere. Every time they all came over, Grandma would make hot fudge in the bowls. To harden up, she would let the liquid sit in the bowl overnight to refrigerate. Then, she would cut up the chocolate in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I really want it. I guess if I drink it, it would be alright. I know Grandma would forgive me,\" May Belle convinced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bowl, she went to a nearby wall and pressed her back against it. She brought the bowl up to her mouth as she could feel her chins pressing up against the bowl. Her cheeks filled up as the chocolate began to get swallowed up by the obese girl. At points, the chocolate would come out of the bowl and a few drops would drop on her pajamas and belly. May Belle reacted by rubbing her content belly which made the chocolate smear all around her belly that was getting even bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter minutes of eating, glutting and moaning, May Belle threw the empty bowl and burped in satisfaction. Her whole face was covered in liquid chocolate along with her clothes. Her pajamas looked like they were about to snap as May Belle was pressing her belly out and moaning in pleasure.</span></div></div>",

Maybe she was in the bathroom,\" May Belle replied back to her Grandma as she was still naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, May Belle just gets into her bed and gets back under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want any pajamas?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I'm tired. Plus, the pajamas may not even fit me now,\" May Belle stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Tomorrow, I will get some clothes for you and Leslie to take back. You can have any clothes from here too if you both want,\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That would be great,\" May Belle said with a smile as she tried to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now, go back to bed,\" Grandma said as she tucked in May Belle and said goodnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, May Belle began to grab her naked body and played with her fat. Everywhere she touched, she felt a tingling sensation from the satisfaction of it all. Finally, she grabbed her developing boobs and let out a small groan. She had never done that, but it felt so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the other bed, Leslie took a peak out of one eye. She was awake the whole time. When she heard movement downstairs, she ran to her room and into the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle and Grandma didn't even notice that Leslie was naked under her bed too, and she had her swimsuit pieces and hat hiding under the cover.</span></div></div>",

She looked in the other bed and saw Leslie softly snoring. She was surprised a moment when she noticed she did't wear her pajamas. Then she remembered what happened last night. She could't help but laughed. Thanks to her laughing Leslie woke up. She went sitting up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning May Belle.\" Leslie said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee you're naked.\" May Belle noticed seeing Leslie's upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie fast pulled up her blanket and looked at May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you're also naked?\" She asked the fat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I had a late night snack last night. There was a lot of liquid chocolate in it. Well my pajama top was partly covered in chocolate stains and the elastic of the pants snapped. Grandma saw me, cleaned me and threw the pajamas in the laundry. They're to small for me anyway. So that's why I'm naked. Now tell me your story. Why are you naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie liked May Belle but she did't thought for a second about telling May Belle what she had done. She tried her best to think of something and suddenly got a idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it really hot last night so I decided to pull out my pajamas.\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's winter.\" May Belle said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's warm inside.\" Leslie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at May Bellle's body and liked her new curves. She looked so adorable so fat. Leslie must admit she was a bit jealous at her size. She knew it sounded strange but since she wanted to get fat she got a bit jealous at the fat little girl.But she knew how to hide it. After all May Belle had Always been nice to her.<br>\r\nMay Belle in the meantime checked out her bigger body. She loved all her extra new rolls of fat and fat folds. She was happy but she knew her parents would't be happy she wondered if she would see them today. She looked out side and saw it was snowing already. If this continued there was chance it might take a while before she got a chance to see them. She would use that time to get as fat as possible. She wanted to get so fat her parents would't have any other choice then accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Leslie let's weigh ourselves!\" May Belle said. \"Too be honest you should weigh yourself naked. Else you also weigh your clothes. Don't be ashamed we're both girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right who goes first?\" Leslie asked. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By all means,\" Leslie agreed as the naked girls went into the bathroom and headed for the scale. Leslie followed behind May Belle as she noticed how much bigger her butt had gotten since the last time she saw it. In some aspects, Leslie felt a bit jealous as she was really starting to like the appearance that fat had on a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I last time?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I believe you weighed 143 pounds. I bet bigger now,\" Leslie reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find out now,\" May Belle said as she got on to the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the numbers began to increase on the scale until it climbed over 100 pounds. The numbers continued to rise past lower sets of numbers until it began to slow down. With a few seconds, the number was passed 143 as it slowed down. Finally, when the numbers came to a halt, May Belle gasped at the answer in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"150 pounds?\" May Belle yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that bad?\" Leslie joked to the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm getting so obese and round. I can't believe I got so fat in that amount of time!\" May Belle said as she played with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got an idea,\" Leslie said to May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make a deal. Whoever has gained the most weight since the last time they weighed themselves will get to eat all day today. The loser and Jesse will have to stuff the winner with so much food today that the only thing the person does is eat and sleep. How does that sound?\" Leslie asked in a dating tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Why not? I mean we don't have to leave for a while unless we are snowed in again. Let's try it,\" May Belle agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this deal in place, Leslie began to step towards the scale. She kind of hoped that she had had more progress compared to May Belle. Leslie was really wanting to be stuffed all day, especially by Jesse.</span></div></div>",

After all they were some sort of gainer friends. She hoped she gained more but at the other hand she liked Leslie so if she gained more then her she was was happy for her. <br>\r\nLeslie stepped on the scale and closed her eyes and waited. May Belle curious looked at the numbers. How they reached 105 and climbed up to 109 and went higher and finally reached 114 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"114 pounds. You gained five pounds. That's great. Good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked down at the scale. She need to see it to believe it. Number's don't lie. She really did gain 5 pounds. That was a impressive weight. Especially for a girl that always used to be pretty slender and was the fastest runner of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it! I gained 5 pounds. I can't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you believe it or not you did gain 5 pounds and we had a deal. Remember?  Stuff the other the entire day. I'm ready for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I know. A deal is a deal. But don't you think it's better if we first put some clothes on. Or do want to be stuffed while we're both naked? That's even less clothes then princess Leila wore when she was the slave of the Jedi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Leila? The Jedi? Who are those guys. I can't remember I ever heard of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they're from that movie star wars. They made several movies of it and they were a great success. After all the Jedi is some giant morbidly obese worm with a giant mouth that's always drooling. He once had princess Leila as a slave. She did't wore a lot of clothing around that time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle reached her shoulders. She was't such a great fan from science fiction movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about it but we better can put on some clothes before we start. That's right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fast started getting dressed. Since Leslie must admit she was a bit sad May Belle won their bed instead of she but at the other hand she liked it to stuff the little girl. But she was't so surprised May Belle gained more then her. After all she was in this gaining thing longer then her, and she and Jesse also were busy running and playing outside. That burnt calories while she staid at home on her fat butt in front of the T.V. <br>\r\nAlso a moment she thought about what happened tonight. It had been fun but it was kind of exhausting. So you did some sort of workout. Anyway she was sue it burnt of some calories but that was worth it<br>\r\nAfter they were  dressed they went to Jesse's room. He just tied his shoes when they went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee did you two never heard of knocking?\" He asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Jesse we weighed ourselves.\" May Belle said. \"Leslie gained 5 pounds since last time but I did gain 7 pounds. You little sister did gain 7 pounds in just a few days. But we also made a bet. The one who gained the most would be stuffed the entire day by the other and you. So the whole day I don't have to do anything else then eat and sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Leslie asked.</span></div></div>",

Grandma was sitting at the table looking at some old photo's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the fire?\" She asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's... no fire.\" May Belle said while taking a breath. \"I and Leslie weighed ourselves and made a bet.

I think it's fun.\" May Belle mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know one thing that you should know... eat slowly. If you eat fast your stomach get's full sooner. If you eat slowly it will take more time to fill your tummy, and some  of the food has time to digest in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks Grandma. Good to know that.\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Jesse and Leslie walked in with boxes, buckets and cans full of food. May Belle's mouth started to water seeing all the delicious food. She laid back in her chair while Jesse and Leslie started to feed her cookies. But she did't forget what grandma told her.

This food is so good!\" May Belle said with a fat grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Leslie was being completely honest, she was jealous of Jesse's sister. She was a lot bigger, and able to eat more food. Leslie knew that once May Belle fell asleep from eating a lot of food, Jesse could start stuffing Leslie with food. That, and he could probably have some fun with her like they had the night before. Currently, Leslie could not stop thinking about the previous night. Everything was so new, but really exciting. When she looked at Jesse, she could tell he was feeling the same thing. Maybe this was true love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what else do you want to eat now?\" Jesse asked his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have pudding?\" May Belle asked. That was her favorite food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do in this bucket.

It will make me fatter,\" May Belle said with an obese grin. At this point, May Belle didn't care about the speed of eating the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well, I got you this hose so you can suck it up like a straw,\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put a hose in her mouth followed by the other end in the bucket.

Just a few months ago she used to be a normal sized girl. Perhaps a bit chubby but not too much but in just a short amount of time she transformed into a obese girl with one thing in her mind and that was: Get fatter. All right that was also in her mind but that was't the only thing in her mind.

Their fits a lot of food in her belly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie thought about this words witch chewing jaws. She knew he was right. His sister seemed to be better at gaining. She was like a small eating machine. She liked May Belle but must admit she also was a bit jealous at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But perhaps she soon does't get a chance to beat you anytime soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Leslie asks between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's all right as long if we are here... but when we're back at our parents house... I don't think my parents are fond at my sisters weight. I know they're not fond at my sisters weight. Perhaps they even force her to diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I did't thought about that. Well I don't have to worry about that. My parents don't care about my weight as long if I am happy, and I am. Come on feed me more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was a bit worried. He liked Leslie there was no question in that, and she wanted to gain and he liked that and would support her. But he knew very well that Leslie had trouble to turn down a challenge. He did't want that Leslie would eat herself sick. But he knew Leslie would perhaps do it. He saw how a lump appeared in Leslie's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Feed me more, I wanna get fatter!\" Leslie yelled    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse fed Leslie more and also enjoyed seeing Leslie's naked body. She looked so good. really gorgeous. Like a female god. But she would look even better fatter. So he would make her fatter. After all you did everything for a god. He noticed his penis got hard. Leslie said she wanted to do the same thing they did tonight and he would  love to do that again. He believed that it would happen after this.<br>\r\nFinally Leslie let out a huge belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's a sign the tank is full, or the belly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right what now?\" Jesse asked.</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes very slowly, but in a very tired manner. She looked around seeing that no one was there. But quickly, she forgot about that when she felt her belly rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I can't believe I am still hungry. But I need to go to the bathroom first,\" May Belle said as she waddled to the nearest bathroom and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she sat down on the toilet seat, she could feel her fat belly in her lap as everything bunched up, making her feel even fatter. While this happened, May Belle began rubbing her belly while grabbing folds of fat, which made her moan in relief a little. Her body felt so good to her, she couldn't get enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to keep getting bigger,\" May Belle said as she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got up and washed her hands, May Belle looked at herself in the mirror. What was staring back at her was a very fat little girl who was once skinny and small. When comparing her old body to her new one, she probably looked like she had doubled in size. She reached under her shirt and continued to feel her belly, closing her eyes with such mesmerization. She then started to take off her clothes until finally, she was standing naked in front of the mirror. Her body was definitely very circular with such a fat belly and butt, round boobs, arms that looked like stuffed pillows, and sides that had many flabs to it. She even began to jump up and down as her pair of boobs jiggled, which she realized felt really good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do this forever,\" May Belle said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but love her fat.</span></div></div>",

The winner (that's me) would be stuffed the entire day by the loser (that's Leslie). Jesse wanted to help.

She looked out the window but did't saw them. It was snowing again.<br>\r\nSince she did't saw them downstairs she guessed they were upstairs ad slowly waddled upstairs straight to her brothers room and opened it.<br>\r\nMay Belle was still a young girl. However she knew very well that babies did't came from the stork like in those cartoons. She remembered how her mothers belly got big and round when her sister was in there, and she saw pictures of her mother being pregnant from her and her other siblings. She knew children came out of their mothers belly, but she had't a clue how they got in there. So she also had't a clue what the two were doing. She also did't had much time to see it since Jesse and Leslie fast cover themselves with the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you two doing?\" She asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you never hear of knocking?\" Jesse asked angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. But what were you two doing, and why are you two naked?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse and Leslie both tried to came up with a lie. Leslie also learned a half lie always worked better then a full lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse just wanted to see my gain over my entire body. So I'm naked so he could see my entire body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" May belle said very slowly. \"But that does't explain why Jesse is naked to. He is't gaining.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... well... that's is... because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I thought she would feel uncomfortable being naked in front of me and it would be easier for her if I was naked too.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle thought about it. It sounded logical that a gain was better noticeable without clothes. She just noticed that clearly in the mirror. The other stuff also did make sense. She decided she believed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but I like to eat some more. Don't forget... we made a deal. The winner would be stuffed by the loser, and I won. Fair and square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. You get downstairs and we come down in a few minutes.\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and May Belle.\" Jesse said just when his sister turned around to walk away. \"Please don't tell grandma about what we did.

A moment she thought about how angry her parents would be if they found out how much she gained, but realized she might as well try to gain more since her parents would be angry anyway. She could eat some but she liked to after she was stuffed to lie down. So she decided to first stuff Leslie. In the meantime she could become a bit more hungry and eat even more, and when she was full she could just lay down doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. We first stuff you, but when you're full you both stuff me. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Leslie said and she and May Belle shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls and Jesse went over to  the cupboard that was filled with fattening snacks. Grandma really did her best. They filled their arms with snacks and waddled over to the living room. <br>\r\nGrandma looked at some old photo's and smiled when she saw the kids enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna stuff May Belle again?\" She asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first we gonna stuff Leslie.\" May Belle said and walked over to grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah since she is still fatter then me while she's a lot younger them me.\" Leslie said who also walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma playfully pushed a finger between May Belle's fat.

Leslie looked a bit disappointed at grandma's finger. \"You still have some work to do Leslie. So you go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie went lying on the couch and opened her mouth wide.

Well it was big for normal people but with how much May-Belle ate most of it would probably end up in her belly. Or in Leslie's belly.

May Belle was by far the biggest as she was in the very obese stage of fatness. Jesse looked at his younger sister remembering how small and skinny she used to be. Now, that little girl was crowded under pounds of fat that would never be shed, but he kind of liked it. All of the food was finished as May Belle's clothes looked smaller, Leslie's shirt looked more tight giving her a pregnant look as she wore her winter hat, which turned Jesse on.

He was't worried. He normally gained a few pounds when he stayed at his grandmothers house. He always worked it of when he got home. Probably it would this time take a bit longer to lose all those pounds. But he would lose it. His sister and girlfriend would't lose their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so strange. Just a few days ago I did't liked fat girls and now I do. Well grandma said I always liked fat girls. But why did't I realized that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat girls were normally considered ugly. Jesse was a bit a outsider at school. He only hang out with Leslie and well he was a boy and Leslie a girl. Well he knew Leslie was a girl. Especially since last night. He grinned. <br>\r\nBut since he already was a outsider and had a lot of imagination some others thought he was a bit of a freak. If he said he liked fat girls they would think he was a total freak. So he probably did't want to believe he liked fat girls. He was happy he finally accepted it. He also liked that Leslie gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie also seemed to like she's gaining. She also seems pretty good at it. I can't wait until she's fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soaped his body in and wondered how it would feel to soap Leslie's body in. <br>\r\nHe grinned when he thought about his little sister. She was getting really fat. He must admit he liked that. How her thighs were rubbing, her rolls of fat were pealing out of her clothing and were jiggling with every move  she made. How her cheeks were bowl puffy and pink. Her flabby arms and big jiggling but. Her chest that already had a start of some boobs, but the biggest part of her was her huge belly. He also liked how she ate so much that her clothes ripped. He wondered or and when that would happen to Leslie. He could't wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will look so good. I can't wait till she has the same size as May Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Leslie would be even heavier since she was taller then May Belle. He tried to image Leslie when she would have the same size if May Belle. That was one of the good things about so much imagination. He could clearly see the picture.  He liked it very much and noticed his penis got hard.<br>\r\nHe turned of the shower and got a towel and rubbed himself dry and wondered how the girls were doing.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I used to wear beanies all of the time, but then it got warm and it was harder to wear,\" Leslie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you like them so much,\" May Belle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie thought about this for a moment as May Belle put on a pink hat with a puff ball on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was a tomboy and I still am. I was definitely more one when I was younger. I liked to look tough, but I also felt safe when I wore them. Like the hat protected my insecurities as a child. It was like something to hide behind,\" Leslie said as she took off the one she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had insecurities?\" May Belle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well everyone does. It is just one way I deal with it,\" Leslie pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like these hats too. Maybe I will wear them more often like you do,\" May Belle said as she pulled the pink hat down over her head more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me. I can give you some more when we get home,\" Leslie said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which type is your favorite?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie dug in the container until finally, she found her favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This type,\" Leslie said as she held it up. It was a beanie that was light brown with a puff ball on top, but the puff on top was very huge compared to a normal one. It had to be almost the size of the actual hat, which was a style from the eighties. Leslie grinned happily as she put it on the top of her head covering most of her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am keeping this one on for the rest of the trip,\" Leslie said as she grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me,\" Jesse said as he entered the doorway all showered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast,\" Leslie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Leslie, I am going to go shower right now since it is open. Then I will weigh myself with you if that is okay,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That's fine. See you in a few,\" Leslie smiled as May Belle left the room, making Jesse grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my Grandma is cleaning the kitchen and making more food,\" Jesse said with a smile as he put on a black tassel hat nearby that had a puff ball on top and at the end of the tassels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means?\" Leslie replied naughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have time to.... You know,\" Jesse said with an even bigger grin as he wrapped his arms around his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it right now,\" Leslie said as she pulled on his tassels and they kissed while Jesse began to grab Leslie's boobs.</span></div></div>",

Besides she need to clean between all her fat folds so we have more then enough time.\" Jesse said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then!\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse took Lelie's shirt and started to move it up. Leslie curled her back so it would be easier for him. As soon if he removed Leslie's shirt she did the same with his shirt. They helped each other pull of their clothes. Now their upper bodies were undressed except for Lelie's bra. Jesse tried to undo it but had a bit trouble how to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never opened a bra?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really... no.\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie helped him undo her bra. Jesse softly took her boobs and softly squeezed in them. Leslie grabbed his pants and pulled them down and a few seconds later Jesse did the same by her.  The started to kiss while the kicked of their pants. They were now almost completely naked except for their underwear. Leslie stopped kissing and grabbed Jesse's underwear left and right and Jesse did the same by her. Both pulled it down. Giggling softly, and looking at each other enjoying what they saw. Jesse felt how his penis got hard. Leslie lay down on her back and smiled while she opened her legs wide. Jesse went lying on her and made love with her both making moaning sounds of pleasure. A few minutes later they were lying next to each other still breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great.' Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you bet. It's all so pretty exhausting.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I could feel every muscle in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a great work out.\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful Jesse. Working out is gonna slow down my weight gain.\" Leslie said and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Leslie went sitting up straight. The water stopped running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May Belle is done.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth kids grabbed as fast if they could their clothes and pulled them on. Just in time. They just pulled their shirts down when May Belle entered their room in a bathrobe and her hair curled in a towel. She smiled. <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

She hoped that would not be the case yet since she was still young. But if she was, she and Jesse could really try and fatten up Leslie more. She smiled at the idea, but not at the possibility even though she was on the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I have definitely gained. I am surprised I can still do some normal stuff,\" May Belle said as she waddled and fondled her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really want to become immobile, don't you?\" Leslie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And I want to find someone to take care of me and feed me when that time comes. It would be fun,\" May Belle said as she felt her chins that covered her neck, almost making it seem like her neck was disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they had gotten to the bathroom and reached the scale.

Her eyes closed. She took a deep breath. and slowly opened her eyes and looked at the numbers. 157 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"157. That are... seven pounds in one day! That's a lot. Did I gain that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you ate a lot. We fed you a great part of the day. Grandma made a huge lunch for us. I guess that lunch was also pretty fattening... don't you think? So you have eaten more and that food was more fattening so it's not a big surprise you gained so much. You're such a little piggy.\" Leslie said playful and started to tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle giggled and pushed Leslie playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much have you gained lightweight?\" May Belle asked teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that back half pined. You may be heavier then me but I'm still taller and older then you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fast pulled of her clothes and stepped on the scale and looked excited at the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"118. Well that's not as much if you... but your huge belly can hold more food then mine. and we also fed you the entire morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" May Belle said while she pulled on her clothes. \"Men those are getting pretty tight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could give you some of my clothes but I don't think you fit in them. I mean you are...let's see.... 39 pounds heavier. So thy're to small for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle must say she liked that. hearing how fat she had gotten. Even to fat to wear clothes from a girl that was lot older then her. She wondered if she would fit the clothes of her older sisters. Perhaps they would be a bit long for her but perhaps the right size. However her sisters were pretty thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fat do you want to get?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle froze. She had't really put a goal in mind. Leslie and Jesse did sort of... until Leslie looked like she was pregnant but May Belle had't put a goal in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm aiming for 200 pounds but... if I reached it I'm going to aim for 300, and if I reached that I'm going to aim for 400, and if I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop now I understand. So you going to gain until... forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I don't know. Who does know what happens in the future. Perhaps something happens. No one knows. But that's the fun part. It's always a surprise. Who knows what happens next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and walked out. Leslie got a good view at her wobbling butt, and jiggling love handles, and could't wait until she would have them.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She looked at herself in the bathroom mirror. She really did like her new look with her hat, but also with her new layer of weight as well. Honestly, Leslie had not gained too much yet, but she really did feel like she was looking pregnant with her bigger belly and boobs. She wanted to change into her leggings to see how she would look in them with her new weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still cannot believe I am doing this.

He looked up as he was watching television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did it go?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am up to 118 and that is definitely some progress,\" Leslie said as she laid next to Jesse and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome!

She looked over to Jesse to see him zipping up his jacket as he put on a black tassel hat.

It's been a ton of fun and I really like these changes. Not to mention how romantic the trip has been,\" Leslie said with a little grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.

Do you think a lot of people are going to say that?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean maybe at first, but once you really start to become fat, then they will see you weren't even pregnant. I don't care either way,\" Jesse grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need to be careful. I hope I don't end up pregnant. I mean we really haven't been using protection and I am on the pill, but if doesn't always work,\" Leslie mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be a hit pregnant girlfriend,\" Jesse joked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.

I had a accident with my jacket. Could you perhaps put a new zipper in it?\" May Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sweetie. I  can easily put a new zipper in it but it would't help you. I should make the whole jacket bigger. Otherwise you can't wear it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. But I thought... perhaps you could give it to charity or to a cousin, and I still have a younger sister, and it's a nice jacket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma smiled widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you put it that way. I will put a new zipper in it. But you need to get a new jacket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure my parents want to buy me a new jacket.

Is't that what counts?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're still my parents. I need to listen to them. They don't like that I'm getting fatter. They don't even like how fat I'm now... before I came here. If they see how  much I gained. They're gonna be so angry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I know your parents. I know what to say against them. Everything will be all right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle wondered if Grandma was sure about that. Her parents were't young kids anymore. She could't tell them anymore what they could and coud't do. While her parents could still do that to her. She had been able to convince them once but that was several pounds ago, Even while Jesse liked it now and Leslie joined her that would't make much difference.   <br>\r\n       <br>\r\nOutside Leslie was still a bit worried about what could probably be going on in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I really should start taking the pill. If we do this more often. I mean I do want kids but just not now. I mean I'm still in school. I first wanna have a house and a job. Who knows... after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could also buy some condoms.\" Jesse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would't be a bad idea. It takes sometimes before those pills work. But you can trust they work. But I did't use them before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was't a reason to use them. I was still pretty young. A bit too young for sex. or so I taught. Besides were I lived before I had't a boyfriend. I had no friends at all. They all thought I was a total freak. With my imagination and all. They did't like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could't like you?\" Jesse asked an kissed her. </span></div></div>",

It didn't take May Belle a long bit of time, but then again, May Belle was not as active as Leslie was. However, the added calories to her body, currently greasy chicken, were taking away her sporty body. Leslie had some stuff on her face from the food.

Her thighs were like huge tires also with rolls of fat on them who almost swallowed up her feet. Her butt was as big at two over sized beach balls But her belly was the biggest part. It was huge lying on top of her body like a mountain of fat with a very deep bellybutton. Left and right of her body lie her huge tits who were both as big as beach balls. Her cheeks were pink and so fat it looked like she stuffed a cheeseburger in each of them. She had two chins and could't move a muscle except her jaws. <br>\r\nShe was eating something and swallowed it. Then Jesse came in with a big plate of food and dumped the food in her mouth. While she chewed he went out and returned with another plate. The whole time, he left, returned with another plate, fed her the food on it and do it all over again.<br>\r\nShe smiled. She felt pretty good, buried in pounds of fat. It felt cozy, comfy warm and soft. No wonder Jesse liked it so much.<br>\r\nShe saw Jesse smiled at her liking how fat she had gotten. She liked it herself too. She was so very fat now and felt so good. She did't have to do anything.

Leslie couldn't move as her rear was stuck to the chair from eating so much. For the first time in a while, Leslie actually felt sluggish and lazy because of all of the food she was eating. In the middle of the stuffing, Leslie looked down at her body. She honestly looked different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now a plus sized girl who had bigger boobs, a muffin top, and a stomach that domed out when she sat down. Her thighs were starting to look bigger as one looked closer at her towards her butt, which also got a little more doughy. Her face was another story. Although she couldn't see it, she had a bunch of stuff all over it from eating so much. Her hat was far down over her head which covered most of her hair and was almost getting in her eyes, but she didn't care as all she focused on was the taste and aroma of the food. May Belle looked on next to her in surprise seeing how much food Leslie was able to consume and how much bigger she was becoming. In all honesty, May Belle kept on feeling like more and more, Leslie was her big sister. In away, she wanted to be more like her. After being handed cookies in her mouth, Leslie spoke for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse..... I'm getting full.... Stuff me a little more,\" Leslie said through gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jesse sat on top of her and began cramming mouthfuls of food into his girlfriend's mouth, which made her gasp in shock from the amount of food. But, he knew that she was almost at her limit. May Belle wanted to stop him, but she figured he would know when to stop. And finally, after a few minutes, she had hit the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that?\" Jesse asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..... Feel like.... A pig,\" Leslie said through gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse kind of felt turned on from his girlfriend. He eve smiled seeing that her shirt looked tighter on her as some skin from her belly was showing. However, May Belle looked on in curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go see how much you weigh!\" May Belle said as she began to untie Leslie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Leslie burped and a button from her pants flew right off. She then adjusted her hat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting so fat,\" Leslie said with a grin as she watched the button hit the ground. </span></div></div>",

He went sitting at the table and took a bite of his own food he nearly touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw how you looked at Leslie.\" Grandma said and smiled when she saw the shocked look at Jesse's face. \"There's nothing wrong with liking a girl. Especially not a girl like her. She's very pretty and also very nice. That kind of girls are rare. You'll never find another girl like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I also like her. Well Not just like... but like like her. You understand. But... I find her really attractive but with every pound she gains, I find her even more attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's no problem.\" Grandma said. \"Every human has his things he or she likes in the opposite gender. Or gays and lesbians in the same gender but lets not focus on them right now. Every one likes something. Blond with blue eyes. A brunette with long legs. A redhead with green eyes. A tanned girl with curly black hair and a tiny waist. In your case a fat girl. There is nothing wrong with that. Everyone has his own things he likes. But its more important how the person is on the inside. That's the most important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I already like's Leslie's inside. No problem there.\" Jesse said, and thought of the fact he really liked her inside, or rather being inside her. \"But now she's getting fat I find her more attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. That means you're Lucky. You have a girl that you like from the inside, while the outside is becoming something you like too. This way you have a girl you like from inside and outside. That's even better then only liking a girl from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Leslie and May Belle were in the bathroom. Both were just in their underwear and both were excited how much they gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you first toothpick girl.\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toothpick girl? Just wait. I won't be a toothpick girl for long midget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie first went on the scale and closed her eyes and the looked at the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"123 pounds! That's five entire pounds. I gained five entire pounds just from one stuffing session?  How is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well grandma makes really fattening food.\" May Belle said calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked at herself in the mirror and noticed how her belly stuck out. She liked seeing this. She also knew that after she would have digested her food her belly would shrink a bit and add more fat to her body. She hoped that her fat would spread a bit over her body. She knew some people gained more weight in their belly while other gained more weight in their lower sections like in the butt and thighs giving them a pear shape.

I gained four pounds!\" May Belle said with a grin as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Leslie slipped her hat far down on her head to the point where most of her hair was not seen.

I want to be fearless like you. You're like a sister to me,\" May Belle admitted. Leslie felt touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like who you are. You are a sister to me. So if that can make you happy, then that's fine with me!\" Leslie said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Leslie,\" May Belle said as she gave Leslie a big hug, making Leslie feel all of her fat on the girl's body, making Leslie want to hold her longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, May Belle, let's have some sister time. What would you want to do first? We can either dress like one another or have a big stuffing session just you and I in the other room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Belle felt excited that she could get some bonding time. May Belle kind of wanted to dress like Leslie first. She knew that right away, Leslie would find an identical winter hat, shirt, and either jeans or yoga pants to fit May Belle but to make them look alike. Or, she could have a stuffing session with Leslie to not only get fatter, but probably not put on clothes and just feel free.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted to just feel free. Besides she did't want to ruin more of her clothes. Not that she minded so much but she knew her parents would't be happy. They always kept the clothes of the older kids. Then Jesse could wear them, after him she and after that her bratty sister. However she would't be able to fit in any old clothes they had at home. At least she did't knew exactly how much her sisters weighed but she doubted it would be anywhere near her weight. She was probably the fattest of all the Aaron's. This made her smile. Just when she pulled of her underwear Leslie came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter. I don't think I have anything that you did't had when you were my age.

Her belly was the biggest feature of her body as it was so wide, two versions of May Belle's former skinny self would be the width of her fat body. Her lower parts were now completely covered by her fat belly and would have to take some moving around to even get to. Leslie looked at her thighs which touched all the way down her legs. Her butt also started to form ripples on it from gaining so much. Then, Leslie looked at May Belle's muffin top, which was made up of multiple rolls. Leslie grabbed MayBelle's side and began to play with it. May Belle moaned a little from the unexpected feeling but began to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Hey, that feels nice,\" May Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Well how about I force feed you some food now and then play with your fat later?\" Leslie said to May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" May Belle said with a smirk as she laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie then sat on top of the little girl over her belly to make her stay down.

She started to eat faster but she was having trouble to keep up with Leslie. She needed to chew and swallow or else she would choke. Leslie was still stuffing more food in her mouth .<br>\r\nMay Belle was a bit scared but also a little bit enjoying it. A bit like being in a roller coaster. It's kind of scary, but at the same time it's fun. That's partly also because it is a bit scary. However nothing can happen and you know it. It was a bit like that. She thought that Leslie would stop if it started to go really wrong. <br>\r\nBut Leslie kept pushing food in her mouth at such a fast rate she needed to swallow barely chewed food to make room for more. Tears started to appear in her eyes but Leslie did't noticed and continued pushing food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Jesse was sitting in the living room thinking about Leslie and May Belle. Thinking how he liked Leslie. He also liked his sister but in a different way. If she only had a clue what he and Leslie did the other night. He knew he could never tell anyone something about this. He knew his parents would be furious if they heard this, and he could't trust his sister's enough to tell them. Perhaps they would tell mom and dad. At school... well except for Leslie he had't real friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fast do people gain weight grandma?\" Jesse suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to many people way too fast.\" Grandma said and laughed. \"Well that's impossible to say, some gain faster then others.

Her belly was feeling full, but she also liked how aggressive Leslie was being as she forced food down her throat. At this point, Leslie was wearing her hat covering her hair. From behind, it almost looked like a boy and a girl having sex from how aggressive the stuffing was getting. Finally, after a short bit, Leslie slowed down and looked at May Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how was that?\" Leslie said with a dark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first, I was nervous from how fast you were going, but then it felt nice after a bit.

Leslie slowly moved over her belly, and her sides and even her chest. But when she touched her chest she noticed some small lumps. May Belle was starting to get boobs. Leslie realized that all that fat on her body spread out and also partly to her chest. That was a luck for her. She must be one of the fist in her class with boobs. She realized that as long if she continued with her gaining, she probably would also get some big tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, that would be kind of nice.

Of course he wouldn't care if people liked it or not, but he knows some people at school may not easily accept it. His main job though was to stuff both of them with as much food as possible.

I mean, she could come over to my place, but you know that they will catch on,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my parents cannot afford all the extra food as well,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we talk to your Grandma about this?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably should. Maybe she can talk to them about it a little bit,\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I just thought about it and I got worried for her and for her making herself bigger,\" Leslie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not the only one who needs to be worried about getting bigger,\" Jesse said with a smile as he grabbed Leslie's belly. They slowly began to kiss as the attraction towards each other filled the room.</span></div></div>",

I just don't want others to know yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Leslie asked with her hands in her side. \"Are you ashamed of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not! But... my parents... if they find out I had sex... We're still pretty young. We might get... in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good reason.\" Leslie said. \"I know your parents can be sometimes pretty... twine. Nothing personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. But well... it's hard with five kids and not having much money. You sometimes need to be... twine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm not sure if my parents are okay with me having sex. But as far if I know no one found out. Let's keep it that way. But that doe's't mean we can't do it. Right?\" She said and took of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse looked at Leslie's beautiful belly a bit swollen from all the food.

She was starting her first one as she walked upstairs into her and Leslie's shared room. She then sat on her bed and continued to devour on the twinkies that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the other two are doing. Oh well,\" May Belle thought as she only wanted to think about her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time of eating, May Belle looked around the room and noticed how it seemed a little messy. She saw the bed sheets that were not made on the beds, some shirts on the ground, and pillows that were flung on the beds as well. May Belle was having so much fun here, especially with Leslie. She began to laugh at the night before, thinking about the fat trick Leslie had tried on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what would happen if Leslie were to get to my size,\" May Belle laughed as she began to think about it. \"Or what I would be like even bigger than this,\" she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a light bulb went off in her head. She began to look at the stuff around the room and began to think of Leslie's experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wait? I could see now what I would look like,\" May Belle grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she began to get the shirts off of the ground, hers and Leslie's, and began to shove them under her already tight shirt. She then noticed that it wouldn't work. But quickly, she got an idea. She took the shirts out from under hers, went over to Jesse's room, and put on a red shirt that fit her, but in all honesty, was a little bigger because of Jesse being an older boy. She then tried to stuff the shirts under the one she was wearing. After that, she got some nearby pillows and began to put those down under the shirt as well. Not surprisingly, May Belle looked massive. But, she continued on as she grabbed all of hers and Leslie's sheets. She kept on stuffing until finally, everything was fitting down the shirt even though the shirt was obviously stretching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the sheets, May Belle was at least three to four times bigger than before. She tried to walk around, but because of the amount of sheets, she could only waddle. May Belle then tried to rub her belly, or in this case, her fake belly. Quickly, she laid flat onto her bed with the twinkie box right next to her. She then stuffed two of them into her fat, gaping mouth. She sucked on them, feeling the greasy juice trickle down her throat, making her moan in pleasure. After moments of swallowing them, May Belle began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a tubby twinkie right now,\" May Belle smiled as her eyes drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honestly, maybe was more like a morbidly obese twinkie as she started to rest for now.</span></div></div>",

During his conversation with Leslie, he couldn't help but see his little sister pigging out on snack food in fron of him and Leslie on the bus. She just kept on eating the chocolate cookies, which made a crusty layer on the outside of her lips, giving her an Oreo crumbed ring around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Leslie was noticing something: May Belle was getting fatter. He could see her small little double chin forming under her puffier cheeks. He looked at her and saw that she looked a little wider, even through her puffier clothing. He was amazed that he didn't notice it before. She wasn't super big yet, but maybe some teasing would progress her weight gain. This is what lead him to continue making fun of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Little Piggy. You enjoying your Stuff-O's?\" Jesse said in a mocking tone to May Belle. He started to giggle while May Belle looked helpless. Leslie noticed this and was sort of dissapointed in Jesse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jesse. Lay off of her,\" Leslie reassured to him. But Jesse wasn't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease up, Leslie. Little Piggy here is the one stuffing her face. Maybe she should lay off of the fattening food before she turns into a fattie!\" Jesse said to her, making May Belle's eyes water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was mean, Jesse. Why me?\" May Belle cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lighten up, May Belle. Oh, wait. That's not happening soon,\" Jesse said to May Belle, making even more tears run down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Jesse. Just shut up right now!\" Leslie said to Jesse in a harsh tone. Immediately, Jesse shut up, but May Belle continued to cry. She grabbed her stuff and moved up a few seats to a vacant seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How could he do this to me?</i> May Belle thought to herself. <i>Am I getting bigger?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, May Belle examined herself. She was starting to gain some weight. She didn't have a huge issue with it, but now she knew that Jesse would be on her about her weight for a while. While looking down at her package of Oreo's, May Belle knew she had to make a decision: gain weight or become skinnier.</span></div></div>",

Also note that in this storyline not a single female character from the Harry Potter world died. Yeah, its weird like that but only men croaked in the War)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry Potter sat in the recliner, watching as the fire crackled in the giant fireplace. His fingers idly drummed against the armrest as he thought over everything that had happened over the last few days and what it meant for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoldemort was dead. Finally, after over 7 years since he'd first entered the Wizarding World, the snake-faced bastard was dead. No coming back from this battle... Harry had seen to that. Of course, as with many things in his life, he hadn't been able to achieve victory without some people being pissed off... namely many of the wizards in Britain. Voldemort, being a petty little bastard, had tried to attack Harry with one final spell as he went down... something about wiping out the Potter bloodline or some rubbish like that. Harry had managed to throw up a shield spell when Voldemort had cast his final spell and the end result had seen the curse splintered and striking half the wizards in Great Britain. Suddenly more than 50% of wizards found themselves unable to get their... wands... up. Harry, upon hearing the first cries of panic and outrage, had wisely decided to hide in the Room of Requirement until it all blew over. Thanks to the House Elves Harry had been able to enjoy his two weeks of solitude in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time he had reflected on his life and everything that had happened and come to a decision: it was time for him to finally get what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Harry... wanted to get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had talked about this with a psychologist the shrink would theorize that Harry's early years are what had caused him to become fixated on packing on the pounds. It wasn't just his lack of food that made him now want more of it; no, it was how his mind equated weight and power. His Uncle Vernon was a huge man and was a commanding, powerful male. So too was his cousin Dudley. It had been imprinted on Harry since he was a child that fat=power. Hagrid had only strengthened this view. The half-giant wasn't a tub of blubber but he was heavy set while being quite strong and having a connection to the world of magic. That had sealed the deal for the boy that was just nearing puberty and for the last 7 years all Harry had dreamed about was packing on the pounds himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as he watched the fire. His professors always complained that he seemed to have not inherited his mother or father's intelligence. What they didn't realize was that Harry had... he just focused on one specific category: weight gain. He'd spent years learning every spell, curse, rune, enchantment and potion that could bloat up a body to the perfect size. He wondered what Snape would have thought had he known that by second year Harry was brewing fat-creating spells that were considered difficult for Potion Masters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason he hadn't engaged in his plans was Voldemort... and not for the reason anyone would think. In Harry's mind, if he gave in to his deepest desires he'd be letting Voldemort know of the power that came from being huge and fat and the Dark Lord would do the same, packing on the pounds to challenge him. Harry couldn't have that... no, not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man took a moment to envision his ideal self. He saw himself being at least four times bigger than his uncle, wonderfully bloated with a massive stomach that draped over his thick thighs with only his fat cock managing to stick out. He could see the heavy man boobs that would protrude from his chest, his flabby face with its many chins, and his monstrous rear that would crush anything he sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dream of his true self, the one he'd had for so long, had changed when he reached puberty. He still fantasizes about being fat but now he wasn't alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted a big beautiful wife to grow plump along with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery night, when he went to bed, a different girl or woman would appear. He'd dream of himself and one of his friends, or a member of the Order, or a classmate, or even Death Eater females surrendering themselves to the joys of fat. They would swell and gorge together, her massive belly rubbing against his as they got bigger and bigger and bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook himself. It would no good to fantasize now... not when he could finally achieve the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, he had decided that today was the day. He would select the woman that would grow with him and they would begin their journey towards becoming glorious gods of gluttony. He had spells and potions and other means ready to begin the process... and to help break his choice should she be unwilling at first to embrace the new life he was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled as he focused, commanding the Room of Requirement to send him his woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry reached over and selected a book Dobby had made for him a few months before his death. He'd asked the little elf to put together a 'yearbook' of sorts, inspired by one he'd seen Dudley carrying around. But this year book had several differences, not the least of which was the fact that it was quite magical and enchanted ten ways to Sunday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first major difference was that it only had photos of the female students. Every student that was currently in Hogwarts (or had recently graduated) was in there. There wasn't a single male to be found and Harry was quite happy with that; while he had discovered potions that would change a person's gender he wanted his big beautiful bride to be a natural witch. He paused, looking over the first years, and activated one of the spells on the book, watching as it presented with images of all the girls aged to a nice and legal 17. He had plenty of 'Grow Me Up' Potion in stock and would keep that in mind if he decided that he wanted someone who was a bit to young to join him on his wonderful swelling journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother difference was that rather than listing things like after school activities and clubs... his book listed dark secrets, fetishes, and ideas on how to corrupt or break a person. He didn't know how Dobby had done it but he once more sent thanks to the little house elf for all the good work he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smirked as he read the info. While part of him hoped to discover that his future bride was just as into the idea of getting good and plump as he was another part, a kinkier part, was hoping that he'd get to try out some of the suggestions listed on the page. Harry wanted to be fat because being fat meant being powerful... and what better way to begin than to break someone or corrupt them into seeing things his way? Of course he didn't say such words... in his mind he was doing them a favor, releasing them from their sad, thin lives and letting them glory in a love of eating and gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many interesting things in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione Granger<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nCurrent Weight: 123 lbs<br>\r\nWeak Spots: A stickler for rules, she fears breaking them; see the unabridged Hogwarts: A History, page 57, for how to use this. <br>\r\nFetish: Has recurring dream of her ass swelling bigger and bigger. At home she routinely will put a pillow down her pants and pretend she has a 'big booty' in her own words<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna Lovegood<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nCurrent Weight: 115 lbs<br>\r\nWeak Spot: While very intelligent her love for exotic animals makes her do irrational things. She would be willing to do anything to physically see certain creatures. See the crumple-horned snorkack currently kept in the Black Family Menagerie; it's fur would do the trick.<br>\r\nFetish: Years spent being ignored have created a dark desire to dominate others. Has been observed reading dom/sub stories when alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny Weasley<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nCurrent Weight: 120 lbs<br>\r\nWeak Spot: Clearly in love with Good Master Harry Potter and would be willing to do anything for him. While it might take some convincing, the proper motivation would get her to agree<br>\r\nFetish: Due to her family Ginny wishes to have a large family and commonly dreams of being stuck in a never-ending cycle of being pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were just three examples... the rest of the book was exactly the same. From the Patil Twins to Cho Chang to Daphne Greengrass, Harry knew which ones fantasies about their feet growing huge (Daphne), to who was into being degraded (both Patils, surprisingly) and who had actually used the Room of Requirement once to indulge in a Vore Fantasy (Hannah Abbot and Susan Bones, both at different times).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a matter of picking the right one... the one who he wanted to be at his side in this new adventure...</span></div></div>",

She'd been staying at the Burrow for the last two weeks and it had felt like her Time Turner had begun to malfunction, constantly sending her back in time to relive the same day over and over. She'd get up, deal with Ginny being depressed that she hadn't seen Harry (seriously, that girl was obsessive to a creepy level) go downstairs to get breakfast, and then spend the rest of the day listing to Ron whine about his dick. She almost knew the words by heart by now. \"It's won't rise up!\" \"I can't get a woody!\" \"Why won't it get hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had fought to roll her eyes many times during his rants. It wasn't like he was big to begin with. The only reason she was still a virgin was that Ron's itty bitty cock couldn't even reach her hymen when he went balls deep into her. Half the time she didn't even feel it. He was nothing like Harry, if the rumors were to be believed. Katie Bell had once mentioned that as a joke she and the other Gryffindor Quiditch Team ladies had burst into the showers when Harry was alone, completely naked and giggling a storm. Their laughter had died in their throats when they saw what he had between his legs; Katie had been unable to describe it and would only whimper at the thought she'd only gotten to see it once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all... with the Burrow so full of people Hermione hadn't gotten a minute to... indulge. She'd never done her little routine during the school year, but it was as if her body knew it was summer time and demanded that she give in and pretend she had a nice big booty. She longed to go home, turn on her parents' 50 inch tv with full cable, and watch some music videos where the girls had, as they said in the songs, ghetto booties. As the music would play Hermione, alone in the house, would take her favorite pillow, the one she'd kneeded and padded until it was the perfect shape, and slip it down the back of her pants, wiggling her fake butt in time with the music, pretending that she too had a wonderful big ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after 14 days of frustration, both at Ron and her own sexual desires, Hermione suddenly found herself in a opulent sitting room, a roaring fire burning and two chairs set up. And there, sitting before her... was Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's eyes couldn't help but dropping to his crotch and she nearly fell to her knees when she saw the massive... serpent... that was twitching in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hermione... let's talk.\"</span></div></div>",

Same old 'minoe, asking a million questions a minute. \"We're in the Room of Requirement. As for why... well, I discovered some things this last year and I needed time to confirm my findings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was surprised at that. Harry doing research... that would be like Ron suddenly growing a pecker bigger than 2 inches ('stop thinking about his microdong!'). \"Well... it can't be that important, right? I mean, Voldemort is defeated... so everything should be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only won by the skin of my teeth... and even then, it won't be worth it if I don't fix my biggest problem,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What problem?\" Hermione said. Harry gestured for her to take the seat opposite his; she never questioned why the chair was so big. \"Is that Hogwarts: A History?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. I was hoping to find out more about the school... escape routes or things we could use to defend it... but what I found is so much worse.\" Harry waited for a moment before continuing. \"Hermione... do you realize we are dangerously close to having our degrees be worthless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?\" Hermione cried out. \"Worthless? but... but how? Because of Dumbledore-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, though I do blame him a touch for not bothering to let us know about this rule. Then again, he probably never knew about it, so I can't really blame him. Until I read it Hogwarts' natural magic had forgotten this rule... but now both of us, and the rest of our classmates, are doomed to fail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked absolutely terrified. SHe'd worked so hard to get amazing grades, sacrificing so much in her drive to succeed... and now her best friend was telling her that she was going to fail?!?  She began to pant and Harry had the Room give her some tea so she'd calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione, we can still fix this. That's why I brought you here. I figure that the two of us should try this first and, if it works, we can let everyone else know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded. \"That... makes sense.\" She frowned, looking at the book. \"But what's this rule? I've read that book 8 times and don't remember some rule that would cause me to automatically fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you've been reading the abridged version.\" Harry patted the book. \"I found this book tucked in the library, hidden behind a bunch of other tomes. It is the original, unabridged version of Hogwarts; A History and contains the full rules of this school. THey haven't been used in ages, since everyone forgot about them, but now that I've read them the old spells woven around them are reactivating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, you're scaring me. What's the rule?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself,\" Harry said, turning to page 57.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'One of the greatest threats facing our newly made wizarding world is our need to have strong bodies. Too many witches and wizards allow themselves to become like skeletons, focusing solely on their magic and not on developing a form like myself. I look only towards poor Salazar, who was so rail thin at the end he could barely lift his wand with his boney arms, and see how dangerous this can be. The rest of the founders joined me in trying to convince our friend to eat more but he would not hear of it. I pointed out that even Rowana,who was always more focused than Helga or myself, was nearly a 100 pounds heavier than Salazar, but he wouldn't hear it. He failed to see how his thin form caused so many of his problems. He claimed he could not find love and this is true; no one wants to sleep with a skeleton. Helga has had hundreds of lovers, as have Rowana and myself. He claimed that the muggles were stealing his magic but failed to realize it was his own body, wasting away, that caused his magical core to weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thus I, Godric Gryffindor, here by proclaim that, to ensure the health of every student who comes to Hogwarts, every graduate's final grade in this school will be determined by how much weight they've put on since coming here. Every 50 pounds shall equal one grade, with anything less than 50 being an automatic zero' </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry watched as Hermione read all this. He didn't bother to tell her that the school had only used the rule for a few years before quietly deciding never to mention it. Personally, he thought it was a shame that the headmasters had failed to honor Godric's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By... by Merlin,\" Hermione whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Harry said, trying to keep himself from showing how thrilled he was with the prospect of getting fat. He wanted Hermione to get there on her own, to be the one to suggest it; otherwise she'd realize something was up. \"Because I read that rule, every student is in danger of failing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Including me!\" Hermione whispered. \"I've gained maybe 40 points since my first year! Harry, what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fail,\" Harry admitted, Hermione's eyes going to pinprick size. \"Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or... we begin gaining weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry... even... even if we were to do that... we'd never gain enough in time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well... I have a plan, actually.\" Harry sat up and walked over to a table, grabbing hold of two vials. \"You see, I spent these last two weeks going over Snape's notes and texts and I found this. It's a potion that is designed to stimulate your body into creating fat tissue. They normally use it for people that are dangerously underweight... but I guess in this situation, thanks to that rule, that includes us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... that will make us-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?\" Harry said, cutting her off. \"Yup. Big bellies and double chins and huge asses that jiggle with every step...\" Harry could see he was getting Hermione to consider this option and decided to press his luck. \"If you aren't sure one of us could test it first... just to see what it's like.\"</span></div></div>",

And unless I miss my mark I think you want me properly porking up as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione bit her lip. Logically this was fucking crazy, but on a very visceral and sexual level this was what she'd been looking for. The thought of him filled her with need. Ron was a nice guy but he was in no way a good fit on any level. Harry was the one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her mouth go dry as the potion kicked in. Normally rail thin and bony, Harry was starting to inflate. The majority of it went to his waste; the spare tire pushing open his robes and highlighting the bulge in his underpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips as she logically guessed the size of the dick underneath. The bright pink belly of Harry's stayed firm by tight skin and the suddennes of the gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make his point, Harry gave his belly a slap and watched it jiggle. \"You see Hermione, you're a smart girl and I'm smart enough to know what you want in a man.\" Moving surprisingly fast for someone who'd packed on fifty extra pounds in a few minutes, he copped a feel on her ass. One of his eyebrows raised, \"I see you've gotten a bit more junk in the trunk since our last meeting. Want to add to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto Harry's great shock, Hermione snatched the bottle from his hands and wolfed down the whole thing. The same effect that happened to him was happening to her, though in her case it was starting in the ass. Great round bulbonous cheeks swelled through her jeans, pushing perfeclty over the top before tearing open the pants. Her quaint blue panties had been turned into a nice g-string that showed from the top of her large, fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her wasn't spared either. A firm, full belly grew out to counterbalance her mammoth ass and large breasts came to rest on her belly. Finally a second and third chin rested atop her brasts. So she was a large stack of fat and torn fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry marvelled at the shredded rags now holding Hermione's rotund, bottom heavy, pear shaped form. \"Magnificnet, I believe you're going to be a fine mother and a better wife.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione put her hands on her vast hips, giving him a hard look. \"If that's the case, I'm going to have to check under the hood; oh and you're going to have to get a lot fatter than that, Mr. Potter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry leaned in and began to feel up her vast ass, \"you know that the old purebloods are weak and inbred; we need new blood to strenghen the wizarding world; the aristocracy of talent is our aristocracy and fat is the only ideal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smirked and started to feel up Harry's gut with her own fatty hand. \"You know I don't do anything halfway. I'll gain a thousand pounds before the month's out, I'll bear you a dozen and more children and you have to be my equal in bed, in school and at the supper table.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's heart was pounding and his belly ached with hunger. \"Agreed, Mrs. Potter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy who would be big drew a second flask from his pocket and downed the whole thing. Hermione's heart pounded as the Porker Who Lived started to match her, but surprass her as well. Maybe it was the potter genetics but Harry was looking even larger than the three hundred pound hermione, his large, succulent errection lifting up the vast apron of his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room can provide a feast, or it can provide a bed, what do you think my love?\"</span></div></div>",

The two of them were narly six hundred pounds together and no ordinary furniture would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione shoved him over, towering over Harry like a lioness over a kill. She licked her lips once more as she grabbed him by the throat. \"I want your cock, I want your babies,\" she growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish,\" his large cock sprung erect from the folds of fat. Without a word, Hermione lowered herself onto his tool. Her little pussy taking his big cock just as easily as she'd taken the formula earlier. At first it was slow but soon she was bouncing up and down. Her formidable flab jiggled as his bulk did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like forever when she felt him release his load up inside of her. But she wasn't done yet. French kissing him deeply, the pair sweated like hogs over an open spit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning. Hermione got down on her knees and smacked her large, flabby bottom. \"Go for it again, let's make sure this counts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMounting her like a sow, the potion that granted him excess fat allowed him exceptional stamina and longevity. Hermione squealed in lust as he grabbed her hair and pulled. He spanked her, choked her and fucked her raw. He took her erect nipples into his mouth and drank the milk that was leaking there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused to eat, snacking on rich foods and soups. They fucked again, staying up all night and only stopping to get snacks. The more they ate the hornier they got and the more they fucked the hungrier they got. The feedback loop kept on going until the pair passed out at the break of dawn, a sweating pile of meat, love and cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nit was a good start to a relationship</span></div></div>",

She felt utterly ashamed of herself that she'd given in and now Harry could see what a pig she was.

Harry, look at me! I'm a beached whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are a goddess waiting to be freed,\" Harry said. \"I'll admit that you've grown bigger than me, so I'll have some catching up, but hey, I'll have fun trying to match you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I don't understand,\" Ginny stammered. \"You... you want to be fat too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Harry said. \"I want us BOTH to be gigantic!\" He threw his arms out wide. \"I want us to be so huge we can't move without magic! I want us to eat mountains of food until we're as big as mountains! I want you to be the biggest, fattest woman on earth and me to be the most obese man!\" Ginny shook her head in shock but Harry merely moved around her, running his hand along her swollen titties. \"Come on Gin... just imagine it... you enjoyed gaining this weight, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" she squeaked as Harry play with her left nipple through her bra cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just imagine how much better it will feel to REALLY let go. To not have to worry about what anyone else says. The Room can provide for us till your ready... you can grow till your so big it doesn't matter what anyone says!\" Ginny swallowed at that and Harry knew he was reeling her in. \"And admit it... you want to see me fat too, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny considered this. She'd always loved Harry fit and trim body but as he began to rock against her bloated form the image of him in her head began to change. She could see him just as big and fat as her, with man boobs as large as her own breasts, a huge flabby face, and massive gut that longed for her to fondle and kiss. Ginny felt her knees tremble and Harry pushed her towards a chair that was seated next to the table laden with food. She sniffed, her mouth watering thought she couldn't tell if it was from the food or the vision of what her life might become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ginny... just say the word and we can give in to our desires. No more rules, no more house points or worrying about what Ron or Hermione might think.We won the War... let's reward ourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny opened her mouth and said-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Truer words were never spoken, and Harry needed no further prompting to indulge his inner glutton. Ginny dove in first, shovelling in a dozen handfulls of french fries with her bare hands. The Weasley's had always been a family with an appreciation for food but Ginny was turing the knob to 11 and tearing it off. The magical feast before them had a hard time keeping up with the redhead's appetite for french fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite it magically refilling, she somehow managed to empty it. to wash it down, she lifted a gravy boat for seven and began to drink it dry; loads of creamy, fatty goodness pouring down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave a grin behind his glasses, Ginny was naked, shaking her plumped white ass unintentionally and he ate it up; metaphorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be outgrown by his wife, the Boy-Who-would-be-Massive started to help himself to a great pot of buttery, fatty lobster bisque. The food was rich and inumagineable to a boy that a scant decade ago had been eating bread crusts under the Dursley's stairs. Boilling hot, Harry almost gave up on the fatty soup. For a moment he panicked and thought he might have bitten off more than he could chew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a streak of anger and hunger went through him. He'd defeated the Greatest Dark wizard of their times. Sure he wasn't that smart; but neither were Hitler or Stalin and if you tallied up the non-human magical beings killed the body count was similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fucking soup would not defeat him. Painfully and gut searing with agony while groaning with pleasure; Harry forced down enough soup to feed seven people. Ginny stopped her gluttonous rampage to watch Harry in awe; taking in about a month's worth of fat, salt and flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the delicious soup forced Harry's belly out. That growing orb of fat and flesh pushed open the robes and popped the buttons off his dress shirt. The pain of the stuffing turned Harry on, and his not unimpressive penis grew hard and tore open the flimsy fly of his pants. Ginny panted with a new hunger at the sight of that naked, thick manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to stuff her face with buttery croissant sandwiches but her eyes never left that fleshy, ten inch long meat pole that Harry packed. It was like a sacred icon to her, the key to her dream of posessing a family larger than the one her mother started. It held the promise of sweaty, fattened fertile flesh soaking up the adulation of a man's touch and the end result of endless days of prosperity and peace. Let the days of war and famine be done. The days of fertility and obesity would be the future. She and harry would become fat with food and child; icons of prosperity in the wizarding world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic of the room began to work extra hard to digest the food that either had eaten. Harry's chest grew fatter as man breasts popped up on his chest and his second chin became more than a dream. Ginny's ass widened and her breasts grew to match those of her fiancee. the untapped power of magic would enable them to live mankind's most decadent dreams of bacchanalia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the empty pot of stew, Harry began to belch but before it had even reached its peak he'd already picked up an enormous tub of custard and began downing that too. Unwilling to be undone by her future king, Ginny began to get to work on a roast pig; the youngest Weasley ripping into the sixty pounds of golden brown meat with inhuman ferocity. Consumed by hunger she hardly noticed her belly spreading out across her lap or her thighs touching. She only knew that the pig was reduced to bones in what felt like seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ginny's turn to belch, her nipples standing fully erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe took note of the ripping noise as Harry's pants fell apart and his robes fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy-who-gained-two-hundred-pounds-in-ten-minutes flashed her a war hero's smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's fatty knees grew weak</span></div></div>",

It appeared that it had started when she was young, wearing her mother's shoes and pretending they were her own feet, but now she wanted so much more. Harry activated a rune enchantment in the book and watched as Daphne, in the privacy of the Sytherin Girls' shower, used her wand to make her feet triple in size. She sat down in the stall, fondling and tickling and licking her own massive soles before finally, with a sigh, returning them to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smirked.

Unlike other Slytherin families like the Malfoys Daphne's family had never actively supported Voldemort. Oh sure, they wouldn't have minded if he won and would have happily lined up to pay homage... but why take that risk? Voldemort had lost before and Daphne's family had known that it could happen again. THus they had carefully remained neutral, letting the Death Eaters do what they wished. They stayed out of the way but they also didn't assist. That attitude had worked out well for them when Voldemort fell and the entire Wizarding World found itself trying to regain balance. Her father and mother had been in and out of the house for days, working to get their foot in the door of whatever power group ended up gaining control of the Ministry. Daphne and her sister had been doing the same thing, visiting classmates and making social calls so that they could reestablish their political ties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne had just arrived after having lunch with a Ravenclaw who, quite honestly, she couldn't remember the name of. It didn't matter anyway; Daphne didn't see anything coming of that. She'd arrived to find herself all alone and had set about changing out of her more formal robes and into something more comfortable. It had been innocent enough, with her shucking the long black robe and removing her shoes... but then the <b><i>Urge</i></b> had come over her. It was a desire she knew all too well... the kinky need to indulge in her foot growth fetish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Queen of Slytherin bit her lip. Normally she would only engage in such things when she was 100% sure she was alone and wouldn't be bothered. Mostly it was when she took a shower, as that was the only time she could take a few minutes to give in. But recently she'd found that those 5 minutes weren't enough and her body needed... more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne sat on her bed. It felt like she'd run around her estate 20 times from the way her heart was pounding in her chest. This was too risky. She couldn't give in here at home... yes, she was alone but at any moment her father or mother or sister could return and the embarrassment that would come from them discovering her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe... if I just did a little... nothing major...'</i> Daphne thought to herself. She reached down and slipped off her socks, revealing inch by inch of her feet until finally her soles were bare. She lowered them to the carpeted floor and wiggled her toes, smiling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were a shrink she'd say that her desire for big feet came from the pressure she felt to be perfect. Her mother and father wanted her to be the best... the smartest Slytherin, the most popular, the prettiest... her carnal need to enlarge her feet was a way to rebel. Perfect girls didn't have monster-size feet, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she sat there looking at her toes wiggling in the carpet she felt a strange urge come over her. \"'If big feet is one way to rebel why not make the rest of me bigger?\" she said to herself. An image briefly flashed in her head of her lying on a massive bed, her feet gigantic to be sure but the rest of her also no longer slim and fit. She could see her thick chunky thighes and huge ass and massive gut that jiggled with every breath and monstrous breasts that could crush a man and a fat full of double chins. \"If I were huge and fat no one would care about my feet. They wouldn't see me as perfect and I could make my feet grow... bloody hell, I could make them even bigger to match my giant gut!\" She laughed at herself and the idea... there was no way she'd be able to gain that much weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying over to her bookshelf she quickly pulled out a thick and rather ponderous-looking tome. Cracking it open, she smirked as she saw that the book she'd shrank and reduced to wafer-thin size was still there. Undoing the enchantment Daphne threw cation to the wind and cracked it open, browsing the pages as she walked back to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Add An Inch... Slim Me Down... and here is the Big Hooking Cheesers...\" Daphne always found the names of the spells in the book so strange but shrugged it off; they got the job done. \"I know it... okay, here it is: Pack on the Pounds.\" She traced the line with her finger. \"Seems pretty similar to the Foot spell...\" She looked at her door one last time before giving a firm nod. \"Bloody hell, just for a few minutes.\" She took out her wand and pointed it at her feet. \"Crescere Pedes!\" She felt the familar tiggle run through her soles and she panted and moaned as the spell took affect. Her feet swelled, growing thicker and wider and longer, double and then tripling in size until they were nearly a meter long. She stared at them as the spell finally finished, the desire to lick and fondle them great... but the next spell seemed to taunt her and Daphne didn't have time to waste. \"Okay... Let's give this a try... Crescere Adipem-15!\" she pointed her wand at herself and felt the magic flow into her belly button and swirl inside of her. \"Oh... oh!\" Daphne panted as she felt the spell take hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with, of course, her belly. Her trim waist, which had always been as flat as a board, began to puff out, first looking like she'd had a big meal and then developing into a nice beer belly. She shuddered as she felt her hips swell up, making her grow wide even as she grew out. Her shirt began to strain against her belly but Daphne did nothing to remove it; she could always fix it with a spell and she suddenly had a great desire to see what would happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt was failing to contain her swelling hips and then her ass decided to join in on the fun. Each cheek ballooned up like they were being filled with jelly, causing Daphne to rise up a bit as the soft mounds went from pert to heart-shaped to full blown big-ass. Daphne was amazing just how comfy it suddenly was to sit there now that she had some padding on her rear end. \"No wonder fat girls like to sit around and eat... this is bloody comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ample bosom was next and Daphne was forced to at least remove her bra due to the swelling tit-flesh that was flowing out of the cups. It didn't matter though once she undid the clasp... her breasts, while now a healthy set of of F cups, looked perfect to her resting on her big gut with only her shirt to contain them. She rubbed her thickening thighs together, moaning slightly as she ran her hands along her nipples that were pressing against her silk shirt; she nearly exploded right there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final change was her face and when she felt it take hold she waddled over to her full length mirror to see what she looked like, giggling at the idea that she now waddled. Staring at herself she was amazing at what she saw. Her neck had thickened but it was hard to see on account of her big round face with double chin (and it was clear she was close to a third). Her nose had gotten a bit broader but Daphne found that it worked well on this new face of hers, fitting in perfectly with her wider features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merlin, aren't I something!\" Daphne said with a laugh. She weighed over 15 stones (220 pounds) and looked like a fat girl who'd tried to squeeze into clothing that was at least 4 sizes too small. Her feet was still huge compared to her body but not as ridiculously huge as they would have looked on her smaller frame. In fact... Daphne thought they rather worked with her fat form. She struck a pose, grinning as she did so. \"Damn... I look hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Daphne didn't know was that she wasn't the only one thinking that. Harry, thanks to the power of the Room, had watched the entire thing and was practically drooling. He couldn't believe Daphne had grown herself all on her own... and loved it!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Auror known as Nymphadora Tonks had been having a weird 2 weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most of the world had celebrated that death of Voldemort she had been in quiet mourning for Remus Lupin, who had sadly died during the final battle against Voldemort. Many had understood and expected her to go into mourning... and that was part of the problem. Tonks was sad but not for the reasons they thought or expected. Everyone thought she and Remus were the loves of each others' lives but that wasn't the truth. Oh, she cared for the werewolf, that was true... but as a close friend. They had clung to each other after the death of Sirius but Remus had understood that Tonks just wanted sexually attracted to him. He'd been fine with that and never asked her for anything more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, somehow rumors had gotten started and soon everyone believed that she was going to marry Lupin and have his little half-wolf babies. That rumor had really gain strength over the last year but Tonks knew that she had no one else to blame but herself. She'd shown up to an Order meeting after taking a few months off to get away from the War and clear her head and returned with a nice little bump in her midsection. Everyone thought it was a baby and Tonks had been too embarrassed to admit that what they thought was her and Lupin's lovechild was actually a beer belly she'd gotten from literally just lying on her couch eating chocolate frogs. It had been so awkward, what with people rubbing her tummy and cooing... especially Harry. The way he'd pressed his hands against her flabby belly had definitely NOT been the caresses of a young man saying hello to an unborn baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonks had spent the last few days trying to figure out how to get out of the mess she'd made when she suddenly found herself standing in a dark room that looked like a mix between the Gryffindor Common Room and Sirius' drinking lounge. Harry Potter was seated in a large armchair, watching her with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tonks... we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wotcher, Harry, you scared me!\" Tons exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean too,\" Harry admitted. \"But I did want to talk to you alone. You see... we have some things to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... and what is that?\" Tonks asked, wondering if this was something to do with his battle with Voldemort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry leaned forward. \"As you know, Sirius named me his heir and with most of the rest of the family out of the way, House Black is in disrepair. I need to build it back up... to make it strong once again. But I won't ever command respect as Head of House Black... because I'm not a true Black.\" His eyes narrowed and he smirked. \"But... if I were to marry a member of House Black...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonks wasn't stupid and caught on to what Harry was getting at that. \"You... you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to marry you and make you the new Lady Black, Matriarch of the Ancient and Noble House of Black.\" The Auror stumbled back and Harry had the room make a chair for her to sit in. She reclined in the massive red chair, staring at Harry with shocked eyes. Before she could say a word Harry held up his hand. \"I know you, Tonks... don't deny you want this. You've been raised on the tales of House Black, the House you never thought would acknowledge your existence... and deep down, in the very bottom of you soul... you've dreamed of becoming Lady Black.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonks opened her mouth but found no words would come out. It was true... ever since she'd been a little girl she'd dreamed of being Lady Black. The power, the wealth, the strength and fame. The Lady Black wielded great power and for Tonks that had been a fantasy that had fueled her dreams for many years. She wanted it... she wanted to have the title and have people bow to her and ask for her favor. She wanted to be treated like a queen and pampered and seen as a goddess among witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she thought of this something else occurred to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry... there is something you should know.\" She missed the smirk Harry wore; she hadn't rejected his proposal and had silently consented that she wanted to be Lady Black... and marry him to achieve the title. \"Sirius never got around to tell you but... the Lord and Lady of House Black-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry snapped his fingers and the Room of Requirement lit up, revealing portraits of every Lord and Lady Black. They might have all looked different but each couple had something in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all HUGE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... believe me... I know, Tonks. House Black shows their strength and power through their Lord and Lady... and the Lord and Lady show their power through their size. I am ready to continue with this grand tradition... to grow huge and fat and return House Black to what is was. Are you?\"</span></div></div>",

Why not us?\" He slowly stood up, smirking as he let his eyes linger on her. \"And you are almost perfect, Tonks. You're brilliant, you're funny, you're determined... there is only one thing wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Tonks asked; she wanted to sound angry but found, staring at this oh so confident Harry, that she couldn't help but feel a tremor of excitement and lust run up her spine. \"And what's wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing that is wrong with me,\" Harry said, placing his hands over hers and leaning in close to whisper, \"we're simply too skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonks' eyes drifted to the portraits of the former Lords and Ladies of House Black and briefly imagined what Harry would look like at their size. She shuddered in desire; as a metamorphic her entire life was built around changing her body but the idea of doing it naturally and, more importantly, having someone else also change their body... Tonks could feel her legs trembling and shifted when she realized she was getting rather wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes drifted down to her crotch before looking back at her. \"So... what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Auror's hair shifted several colors before she managed to speak. \"Yes... yes, I'll marry you Harry! I'll be your Lady Black and together we'll make House Black grow in power as we grow in size!\" The moment she spoke the words there was a flash of light and an engagement ring appeared on her finger. She lifted in up, staring at it in delight, Harry smirking as he saw a hint of greedy flash across her face. She'd just gotten a taste of what House Black could give her and Harry was counting on the House's own magic to help further corrupt his bride-to-be until she was just as he desired. \"I don't want to be Nymphodora, though,\" Tonks said firmly, standing up so she was standing toe-to-toe with Harry. \"I want you to officially make me Tonks Black.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry chuckled at that. \"I'm fine with that, Tonks, but the wedding will have to wait a bit. I won't be marrying you until it is near impossible for me to do this!\" Harry reached out and grabbed her, dragging her into a soul-searing kiss. The Auror moaned, her fingers running through his hair as she returned the passionate kiss. She began to grind herself against Harry, moaning in pleasure as she opened her mouth and let his tongue duel with hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments they broke off and Tonks panted. \"It will be a shame when our belly's are too big for us to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find other pleasures. Now come on... let's eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonks nodded, following Harry to a large table the Room had formed for them. The two of them sat down in large charges that were so wide and deep they looked like little kids. All manner of food was laid out for them, supplied by the House Elves. All manner of ducks and gooses and pheasants, dripping with juices, along with hams and lamb and piles of bacon. There were muggle foods too, like hamburgers and hot dogs and pizza and Tonks grabbed one of each and began shoveling them into her mouth, moaning between bites as she tasted each delicious dish. She glanced over at Harry and saw that while he was staring at her with absolute lust he wasn't letting that stop him from chowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes stretched on and their neared the one hour mark Tonks marveled at the fact that she still felt hungry. She wondered if it was some magic of the room or something in the food or if Harry had done something to her but she didn't care... she just wanted to eat more and test the limits of this strange and wonderful gift. All sense of manners where forgotten in her quest to match her fiance ('He's my fiance!' Tonks thought with a girlish giggle) and both her and Harry crammed food into their mouths, trying to get every bit but much of it falling down onto their laps, staining their robes. Tonks looked over at Harry and paused just long enough to lean over and lick some ice cream that had been smeared on his face, smirking at the trembles that ran through his body at her kinky little action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours they'd destroyed everything on the table and an elf popped in to tell them it would be another few minutes before they could begin on the second course. Tonks took a moment to inspect herself and her fiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had been very skinny the first time she had seen him but now it was hard to equate that thin little boy and the rotund man before her. The first thing she noticed was his gut, which forced his robe open and had his dress shirt riding up. Sitting on top of the newly developed belly were a pair of man boobs that, while a small B cup on anyone else, made Tonks' mouth water. His face had plumped up and while he hadn't developed a second chin yet she knew it was coming. His arms and legs were also a bit fatter and his rear had begun to fill out his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for herself, Tonks looked in the mirror the Room had provided and let out a coo that, until that moment, would have been completely out of place for her to murmur. Her already bloated stomach had become a full on gut that lay across her lap. Her robes, like Harry's, had been pushed aside to give her a perfect view of her tummy; she had a feeling by the end of the day her inner belly button would be an outie. Her thighs were thick and heavy and she delighted it rubbing them together and she could feel that even her feet had gotten fatter, swelling in her boots. Her hands looked bloated and her fingers like thick sausages while her rear had gone from flat to perky to bubble to completely lardy... and she loved it! She ran her fingers along her face, admiring how she looked with her puffy cheeks, and then slowly trailed them down to her breasts. Oh, her breasts... they were so big her shirt strained to hold them in! She reached down and found a hot dog had landed in her cleavage and she fished it out, smirking at Harry before she deep throated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better,\" Tonks said softly. \"I feel... like I am finally discovering who I was meant to be all this time.\" She looked down at her food-stained clothes. \"But my robes aren't going to last long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rubbed his chin with his pudgy fingers. \"Well, I suppose we have two options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, on one hand, I'd love to see you grow out of those clothes; burst out of them as a final showing that the old, thin Tonks is dead and the new Lady Black has taken her place. On the other...\" he reached down and Tonks licked her lips at the obvious bulge in his pants. \"I so badly want us naked and exploring what these bodies can do. Up to you, love... what do we do?\"</span></div></div>",

Even if she was MUCH too skinny for Harry's tastes even he could admit that she was stunningly beautiful. It wasn't just her Veela allure, however, that made him say this; no, Harry looked upon her and saw the framework of what could be the perfect woman. It was like how a master builder could look at framework and see the mansion that was to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked to himself, allowing his mind to wander just for a moment, envisioning what Fleur could become if he took her as his. In his mind's eye she was wearing that same outfit she'd donned when she'd first arrived in Hogwarts, only now the shirt and jacket could not contain her massive gut while her giant, jiggly ass pushed her skirt up so much that it was impossible not to see her dripping sex (no panties would ever be able to contain her if Harry had his way). The French loved their food and Harry had a feeling that if he were able to get her on his side of things she'd be more than willing to push the limits as much as he wanted to when it came to growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as an added bonus, with Fleur being a bit of a sex symbol along with a Veela... she might help him become a trend-setting couple, with the two of them reshaping how the Wizarding World thought of beauty and ushering in a new age of glorious gluttony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stood from his chair and began to pace. The only question was... how did he go about things. On one hand he hoped Fleur would be willing to join him, to surrender herself to the glories of stuffing without any prodding. On the other hand... the darker parts of his mind considered how wonderful it would be to break her. Fleur had been so aloof and even a bit condescending when she'd first met him... he could pay her back for that by breaking her until she became his willingly. Perhaps he could even use her lovely sister (who, from what he had heard, was growing up to be just as beautiful of a woman...) and the life debt she owed him to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling on a course of action, Harry called out for the room to bring him Fleur...</span></div></div>",

He remembered seeing a movie a few years ago when the Dursleys had been away on a vacation he wasn't allowed to go on. It had been a parody of Star Wars and while it had great laughs one comment stuck in his head: \"Evil will always triumph... because Good is dumb\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Order and the 'Light Wizards' had made the same mistakes every time there was a Wizarding War. They would win and believe that their victory would bring about peace... only for darkness to rise up again. The Dark faction was simply too strong and too engrained to ever truly go away and Harry knew that this war's ending would be the same: a few years of calm followed by some new Dark Lord appearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was a way around this and it was a simple one at that. If he married a Death Eater than he'd control both sides. The Light would believe he had 'saved her' (and he would... not through white magic but through the glory of eating!) and rally to him. The Dark would believe he was the next Dark Lord and want to be in his good favor (Harry didn't plan on going Dark but if he was going to gain as much as he wanted then he needed to have power as well... servants to bring him and his bride food, people to manage the boring tasks while he focused on getting bigger, stuff like that). It was all rather simple... and in the end he would get what he wanted. Hell, if he played his cards right he might have witches from both sides lining up to follow his and his new bride's example... the idea of witches all over gorging themselves in hopes of creating a harem of plus-sized witches had Harry drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he came to a decision.

He knew for a fact that Bellatrix had been under lock in key in the revamped Ministry, with every kind of magic suppressor and anti-apperating spell in place. But all it took was for him to utter the words and Bellatrix Lestrange was standing before him, looking about in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, if it isn't 'ittle-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room, gag and restrain her,\" Harry said firmly. Bella let out a yelp as she was lashed to the spare plush velvet chair, soft yet strong bindings holding her in place and a ball gag one might find at a sex shop shoved in her mouth. Harry raised an eyebrow at that but decided to wonder how the Room knew about sex toys at a later date. \"I bet you're wondering what you're doing here?\" Harry said with a smirk. \"Well, you see... I've had some time to think and I've decided, after everything you've done to me... the people you've taken from me... that it is time for you to begin working on making it up to me.\" Bella thrashed against her restraints but couldn't escape. \"Now  now, no need to complain. After I'm done with you you're going to feel so silly trying to refuse the joys I am about to give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry walked over to his potions table and selected a vial. \"I had thought about using the Imperius Curse on you but I decided that there wouldn't be any fun in that. You see... you enjoy breaking people, don't you Bella? Can I call you Bella? Great. You get off on doing things to them until they crack and go mad. Well, I decided that if it works for you it works for me.\" He leaned in close, stroking her cheek, and Bellatrix, for a moment, actually felt a flash of fear go through her. In that moment Harry Potter reminded her so much of her lost Lord Voldemort and she felt her insides tremble at the thought. She tapped that down though, reminding herself who this... boy... was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry merely smiled and whispered, \"I'm going to break you, Bella. I am going to use such wonderful sexual torture on you... and when I'm done you'll be mine. You'll embrace all my desires, you'll live to serve me, and you'll spend the rest of your days as my happy little-\" he snickered at that, \"-sorry... as my happy wife.\" Harry tapped the ball gag and it suddenly gained a hole in the center. Before Bellatrix could react Harry poured the potion down her throat. \"This first potion is just a taste of the reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went back to his potion's table to get a second potion Bella felt her body tremble. It was as if a fire had been lit in her stomach and the wonderful heat was spreading through her. Harry turned to watch, the Room creating a mirror so Bella could stare at herself. She stopped thrashing and her eyes went wide as she saw that she was actually getting younger. All the damage done to her body thanks to Azkaban faded away and her hard body softened, her flesh becoming smooth, her curves more pronounced, and any wrinkles disappearing. By the time the potion was done Bellatrix looked like she was roughly in her early 20s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she noticed she was a bit... thicker... than she had originally been, she didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the punishment,\" Harry said with a laugh. \"Though, I doubt you'll think of it as a punishment for long.\" He poured the second vial down Bella's throat, murmuring \"This is for you, Sirius... enjoy the show!\"</span></div></div>",

She'd expected the potion to instantly do something to her... make it feel like her insides were melting or cause her to have nightmarish visions. She expected pain and agony but all she felt was... nothing. Nothing changed, nothing was different. She felt exactly the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a snort. Of course little ickle Harry Potter wouldn't be able to follow through on his threat. He, like all of those that sided with him, were all talk and bluster and nothing more. Bella just wished that she didn't have the gag in her mouth as she'd love nothing more than to laugh right in his face over his failed bluff. It was just so pathetic and sad, the way he wandered over to the table loaded with food ('when had that appeared there... no matter') and casually began to nibble on a tart, watching her and waiting. He was clearly hoping she would be thrashing in fear, demanding he tell her what he'd done. but it would never happen... Bella knew torture and instantly knew that this was no-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let out a soft moan, the hand that wasn't holding the treat slowly sliding down his shirt. Bella watched, surprised and a bit entranced, as the loose-fitting shirt began to tighten a bit. Harry didn't show any signs of caring about this new development, choosing instead to take another huge bite of the tart. His tongue darted out to lick away the crumbs from his lips but Bella was more focused on Harry's shirt, which was now straining against his body and giving her peaks at the flesh that lay underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it... Harry Potter had just developed a nice beer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Bella felt like she was going to cream her panties right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't understand it one bit but the mere sight of Harry's belly straining against his shirt was the most erotic thing she'd ever seen. Bellatrix was no strange to the sexual arts and during the first war she had happily used her own body to break her playthings. She'd so enjoyed forcing husbands to watch as she reduced their wives into happy quim-licking bitches... just as much as she enjoyed using her lips to bring a man to the brink of orgasm before sliding away, leaving him in pent-up agony. She'd fucked many men and found the power it gave her to be like a heavy drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this... this wiped all that away. The sight of Harry Potter running a finger along his beer belly had the demented Death Eater twisting in her seat, rubbing her thighs together at the mere sight. She could feel her juices flowing in her pussy and soaking her panties, some of her nectar oozing down her leg. Harry casually turned around so he could grab a turkey leg and Bella thrashed about as she saw his ass swelling in his slacks, making them look like they were painted on as his hips thickened and his butt got bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned back around and walked towards her, his shirt barely containing his gut. \"I see you've figured out what that potion did,\" Harry said with a smirk, taking a bite out of the drumstick. His belt groaned as he gained a few more pounds. \"It's altered the parts of your brain that react to sexual stimuli... now the sight of either of us gaining weight will have you on the cusp of orgasm.\" Harry leaned in and Bella whimpered as she felt his heavy belly press against her thin frame. \"But you won't cum until I let you.\" She stared at him, her body now finally feeling the fire she'd expected but not in the way she'd thought it would come. He snapped his fingers and the ball gag fell away. \"And I hate to break it to you Bella... but I don't fuck skinny bitches.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What Harry did to Bella was cruel no doubt, but then again it was far from the worst he could have done to her and she'd done much worse in the Wizarding wars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she refused to submit, Harry magically chained Bella into an eternally refilling trough of french fries. It was basic, kinda delicious, very fattening and as an added torture it would be monotonous after a while. But the magic he'd put on her prevented her from feeling full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he dined across from her, helping himself to heaping plates of potatoes, lobster, pork, beef, juicey apples and pomegranites and thick, fatty creamy liqueurs. Harry ate like a king while Bellatrix ate like a hog in a trough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella herself ate and ate, unable to help herself and only finding that the eating stopped her hunger only temporarily. When she'd digested enough, her hunger returned stronger than before. And so the vicious cycle went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hardly slept and there was no way to judge day and night cycles, It took her a very, very long time to figure out that she was porking up. She began bottom heavy, bony ass filling out, turning into a ghetto booty before turning into a major wide load. The heavy white ass of hers was a perfect set of squishy jiggly globules which moves like jelly with every shake of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs began filling up. She hardly noticed it until they bega to rub together almost all the time. AT first she tried just keeping her legs apart but that soon wasn't a noption with how heavy her middle was getting. A large pumpkin belly started to form around her waist, danging down until it nearly touched the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to magic and potions, Harry was bigger every time he walked in and out. Today of all days, his belly entered the room before him, swaying with each waddling step. His vast ass pushed out his robes behind him and to tease her, he'd opened up his robes to reveal his soft, squish man boobs. The sight of those little red, erect nipples like strawberries around Bellatrix ever more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sat down and devoured a whole three hundred pound pig while his soon to be wife Bella continued to gorge like an actual pig. The snapping of her robes finally woke her out of her trance. Bella realized that she'd totally outgrown her robes and was naked as the day she was born. As she did, the magic chains fell off and she was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry belched and rubbed his engorged moon of a belly, so vast it reached his knees. To add to a bit of allure his large robes remained on (thank you, engorgio charm.) and he shifted to try and digest his massive meal before moving onto desert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Harry's three chins wobbled as he raised one fatty arm and waved a finger in a \"come hither\" gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella complied, crawling along the floor like a prized sow. Instinctively she crawled between Harry's legs, belly dragging on the ground and engorged j cup breasts dangling. She sought out the throbbing, now ten inch member under Harry's fat belly and started to suck on it with the same enthusiasm she did with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gasped, thrown off by how good Bellatrix was. She knew how to suck, knew how to use tongue and teeth and could get all the way to the base of his long wand. Evidently when you were a big as glutton as she'd become, deep throating a horse cock was no major problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nearly cried out, his self control nearly undone, he began to play with his soft, errect nipples as Bellatrix sucked him like he was the last man on earth. His explosive orgasm shook his whole four hundred pound frame and took the breath away from him. Bella swallowed the whole thing, unwilling to let edibles to go waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning coquettishly, she began to stroke his belly and lick his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly in a state of bliss euphoria from the orgasm and the belly rub, Harry leaned back at his first apparant victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up from that state when he saw Bella leaning against the feasting table, her globular fat ass thrust out and stuffing her face with anything in reach. Deliberately, she began to wave her butt from side to side, and Harry knew what he had to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fat form moved like a slow motion avalanche. his large form slammed into her ass and his cock instinctively sought out Bella's holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy this, my wife,\" he purred. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry grinned as he began to slowly thrust into Bella's asshole. He gripped onto her thick, meaty hips with is huge pudgy hands, nearly exploding again as he felt that delicious fat against his palms and fingers. He'd waited so long for this, desired to feel his body bloat up with glorious fat and then take a woman and show her the glories of gaining. And now, at long last, he'd achieved his dream and it was better than he'd ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of that was the knowledge that he'd broken the great and deadly Bellatrix Lestrange. Oh, it would have been fun to stuff someone like Hermione or Luna and then plow into them until their huge bellies jiggled, but this was so much more. Harry wanted to be fat because fat equaled power in his eyes. And being able to put Bella into his power and render her and reshape her into his image of beauty was like a grand drug. He crammed a pastry into his mouth even as he slammed harder and harder into her body, crowing in delight not only in the feeling of her big beautiful butt swallowing up his thick meaty shaft but also the way she moaned and grunted with every thrust. She was his, even if she hadn't admitted it yet, and he looked forward to seeing her only get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, they would be getting bigger. As Harry reached around Bella's massive frame to grab a hunk of chicken and tear it right from the bone he knew that this wasn't the ending but the beginning. He'd gotten a taste of what it meant to be fat and he found his appetite only grow more fierce at the thought of MORE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes Harry pulled out, Bellatrix letting out a whimpering gasp, but Harry merely grabbed hold of her and spun her around so he could look at her. The once thin, aristocratic face that had cackled at his pain was now swallowed up by puffy fat cheeks and three thick chins with a fourth ready to appear. Fingers that had once been so nimble were now bloated sausages covered in grease. Her body was covered in sweat and Harry leaned down, licking her right nipple and causing her to moan as he tasted her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what I told you when I first brought you in here?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella looked at him, licking her puffy lips, and Harry smirked as he remembered just what she'd done with that tongue 10 minutes earlier. \"You said you'd break me... and I'd feel so foolish for trying to resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you?\" Harry asked, grabbing a fist full of cake and shoving into his mouth, crumbles falling onto Bella's big titties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you remember what else I said?\" Harry asked lazily, shifting his stomach to rub it against her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that you'd make me your wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Harry said with a pleasant smile, offering her a donut. Bella, after a moment, ate it up. \"And you want to be my wife now, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Bella whispered, her body still thrumming with the need to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be Big Bella Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll grow bigger with me, won't you?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how big?\" Bella asked, fear of what her foe would do to her warring with her desire for her future husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I honestly don't plan to stop growing,\" Harry admitted. \"Imagine it, my dear... one day you could be as big as Hogwarts...\" he shifted and Bella felt his thick, meaty cock rub against her hungry lower lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Bella moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another side effect of that potion,\" Harry said casually, draining a bottle of butterbeer and letting out a belch. \"If I cum in you... you will get pregnant.\" Bella's hands went to her huge belly. \"That's right. We do this and you'll never be able to go back. I'll fact you every day and you'll spend the rest of your days pleasuring me and producing our fat happy babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...please...\" Bella moaned, bucking up, nearly impaling herself on his cock. \"Fuck me... fuck me Harry! Make me your wife! The mother of your children! Make me Big Bella Potter and fill me with your babies! Please! Just-\" Her pleas turned into moans as Harry thrust inside of her, driving his rock-hard monster cock into her eager pussy. Bella screamed and yelled in delight, rubbing her food stained hands along her robes even as their massive bellies slammed into each other. Four hours the two of them fucked until finally they came together, Harry and Bella destroying the table and landing in a heap on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rested there for several minutes, basking in the afterglow, until Bella finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No now she had been able to get to know the real Harry Potter and she loved him, the only issue he had no interest in her what so ever and all she wanted to know was how,to,get his attention. And as if mother magic herself had looked down on her that night she would find out how to get Harry Potter to fall for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the last night before they finished another year at the school and she had finished her packing and was lying on her bed thinking about the man she loved when one of her fellow class mates came into the dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey Ginny\" she said as she walked to her own bed the one next to ginny's \"How are you\"<br>\r\n\"I'm alright how about you\" Ginny's replied as she stayed lying on her bed.<br>\r\n\"I'm good, right listen I have some news that may shock you but might help you and yes it is true I truest my source\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny instantly shot up \"what, what is it.\"  Alice bit her lip as she looked towards her <br>\r\n\"It's about Harry and erm I think I know why he doesn't like you like that and well what you could do to help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was now listening with every fiver of her being \"What why dosent he like me what have I done\"<br>\r\n\"It's not about what you've done it's more about what you aren't\" Alice said as she sat down on her friends bed \"right now don't freak out but the reason he dosent like you is erm\" Alice hesitated for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it please tell me\" Ginny begged desperate for a chance to get with Harry\"<br>\r\n\"Well the truth is well Harry likes bigger girls\" As she said this she used her arms to her having a belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny looked at her with her mouth hanging open. \" He likes fat girls!\" <br>\r\n\"Well more chubby girls than anything, I'm sorry ok but I've got to go I need to go help my sister pack\" Alice then left the dorm room closing the door on her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ginny was completely shocked she had known that Harry wasn't physically attracted to her but she thought it was for diffrent reasons not that she wasn't chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she realised that it was true as this year she had noticed him looking at one of the 7th years who was a bit of a chubby girl and she had seen him blush when her belly had been visible.

Many students were looking forward to friendship, house rivalries, and the spells they would learn. However, instead of thinking about the school year ahead, one person was sitting in a compartment by themself enjoying a magical newspaper. That person was Luna Lovegood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany knew her as a crazy girl who never made any sense to anyone but herself. Some people talked to her, but a lot of people weren't really friends with her. In many ways, Luna didn't seem to care as she had herself to enjoy along with her thoughts. She was perfectly fine with flipping through her newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rita Skeeter is at it again. What a gossip queen,\" Luna said to herself as she was laughing at a gossip article by Rita Skeeter, the crazy journalist at the Daily Prophet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard a loud bang as someone outside her compartment fell to the floor. She saw that it was a girl laughing as she was trying to run from someone else on the train. She noticed that the girl was a Hufflepuff third year. However, she noticed that this girl was different, in this case, bigger than usual. She had seemed to gain more weight over the summer, which explained how the thump sounded very loud to Luna's ears. In some way, the idea was perplexing as she looked at her own body. For the most part, Luna was very skinny. She had always been that way since she was young. She started to wonder at the idea of gaining weight. What would it be like? How would she look? Would she want to try it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, her compartment door opened as the trolley cart stopped in front of Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything from the trolley, dear?\" asked the trolley lady with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna began to think about what she wanted. </span></div></div>",

For the next couple of minutes, the trolley lady started to put the candy into Luna's cabin by setting it on one of the empty seats. After transferring the candy, the trolley lady left while Luna looked in awe. She didn't realize that the trolley had so much food! Most of the stuff was candy, but all so large. There were chocolate bars, big bags of jelly beans with many flavors, licorice wands, chocolate frogs, and many more items that caught Luna's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess this is a start,\" Luna said as she started to grab some of the candy and dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, eating the candy was a breeze as she kept on stuffing the contents down her throat. Luna could feel her stomach filling up, which gave her a sedating, content feeling. However, after a short while, Luna realized that she was starting to feel full. Even though she was feeling this way, she continued to push through with eating. With chocolate spread across her face, Luna was starting to look more gluttonous and sloppier than normal. She didn't care for the fact that she was alone in the compartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost finishing the candy, Luna patted her belly, noticing that her stomach was distended and hardened more than usual. It wasn't that noticeable, but she still realized it. This gave her a drive to finish the rest of the candy even though she was feeling so full. With the last bit of candy in front of her, Luna grabbed the rest of it with both hands, opened her mouth, and stuffed it all in. Her chewing and swallowing was followed by a loud burp and moan in pain. Her stomach was really hurting, but she was still happy that she had eaten all of the candy. Not caring about anything around her, Luna drifted off to sleep with her hands on her stomach.</span></div></div>",

She had dark skin and darker hair, frizzy and fluffy like an ominous cloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna grinned and began to rush towards her, turning on her heel midstride and beginning to walk backwards, sticking an arm straight out. \"Hello!\" She chirps, her shining white teeth almost glowing in the daylight. \"Oh...

The peppy blonde took her seat between two of her peers, making sure to keep Hermione in her sight just a few seats down. That flowing, frizzy hair, her soft pale cheeks and little round nose... Luna sighed heavily, before making herself a plate of eggs on toast under the enchanted artificial sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Luna?\" A schoolmate asked, Jazz from the room next to her. \"Yes, just had a big breath in me is all. I'm getting rid of it to make room for a big meal.\" Luna's classmates giggled at her response. It wasnt close to the weirdest thing she's ever said, but it did remind them that the bar was set quite high around Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a sandwich of sorts from her eggs and toast, chomping into it with purpose and veracity, chewing it eagerly. If she could swallow with vigor, she did. This continued at a quick pace until the sandwich was gone, and Luna rolled up her sleeves, reaching for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, slow down love.\" Jazz says, \"You'll give yourself hiccups.\" Another schoolmate chimed in, a Quidditch player that Luna had only seen a few times. \"Don't wanna make yourself sick, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary.\" Luna says, lifting her nose. \"I feel sick to my stomach without any food, and i wasn't joking about that big meal.\" She triumphantly tears into a bacon strip, before making another odd menagerie of a sandwich.<br>\r\n\"If there's one thing I've learned at Hogwarts, it's that as silly as Luna is...\" the girl across from Luna said, \"She's NEVER joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Gryffindors around her burst into laughter, and turned their attention away from the gorging girl. Luna continued to stuff herself, but after 3 heavy sandwiches her tummy was fit to burst, feeling tight and full underneath her shirt. She panted and looked down, gritting her teeth. Her stomach was visibly bulging, but it wasnt popping any buttons!</span></div></div>",

While she wasnt able to come up with a viable potion, she had come close, which in Snape's own words was \"less than he had hoped for, but more than he expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Snape went on about how he would make this test much harder than the last, and how existing potions would NOT be tolerated, Luna noticed Hermione wrinkling her nose, and looking to her.

Erm, Luna...\" Hermione greeted her, only to be met wish a hand inches from her nose. \"HI!\" Luna blurts out, grinning. \"Lovely morning. Hmm? This was one of my favorite assignments too! Can you belive he's doing it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gulps, shaking her head. \"I can't... I only passed the last iteration with an 80 percent score...\" Luna froze, blinking twice. \"... 80? Thats impossible.\" Luna said softly. \"Im afraid not. The potion i came up with was perfect... Too perfect. Extract of Philipson's brew. Snape basically interrogated me to make sure I wasn't plagiarizing,  just because twice distilled potions are so rare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nods. \"Alright... Then why come to me?\" <br>\r\n\"Because,\" Hermione says, \"I heard you got a grade almost as high as mine based on creativity alone. It must have been good, if <i>Snape</i> liked it.\" Luna had never thought about it that way, it made her blush. \"Well, thanks Hermione... I assume you wanna team up?\" Hermione purses her lips, then nods sheepishly. Luna hugged her new partner, eliciting a loud squeak from Hermione. \"Alright. Let's do it!\" </span></div></div>",

I was wondering about something, and was hoping you could help me?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlughorn gestured for her to continue as he began to pack various ingredients into his case. <br>\r\n \"I recently stumbled upon a recipe for a potion in a book on the library. It had been scribbled on a scrap of parchment, and I was wondering if you could help me identify it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. <br>\r\n \"I suppose I could help, Miss Evans. What ingredients were used in the potion?\"<br>\r\nLily dug around in her pocket for a second, pulling out a crumpled corner of parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um... It uses... these. I'm unfamiliar with some of the ingredients, so...\"<br>\r\nSlughorn took the scrap from her and quickly scanned it. His brow furrowed in confusion. <br>\r\n \"Well, I must say...\" He began. \"I am... unfamiliar with this particular potion. But, as one of our most promising students, if you wish to brew this, then I will be happy to assist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nodded enthusiastically. <br>\r\n \"I'd love to! But what if it turns out to be dangerous?\"<br>\r\nSlughorn gave her a knowing smile. <br>\r\n \"Worry not, Miss Evans. I may be unfamiliar with the potion, but there are telling signs that a potion is dangerous. Now, I believe you have a class to get to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"> &lt;Later&gt;</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily rushed into the potions classroom. Her bag clinked with the various jars and bottles of ingredients she had spent the day collecting. <br>\r\n \"Alright, let's see here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting up at her usual desk, Lily smoothed out the piece of parchment holding the recipe. <br>\r\n \"Crack the scarab shells with the flat of your knife... Add a few drops of syrup of hellebore... Some lacewing flies... Some Sloth brain... Stir clockwise for three rotations, then anti-clockwise for two rotations... Repeat until potion is a dark yellow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily quickly lost track of time as she stirred and added ingredients to her cauldron, which bubbled and steamed with each ingredient she added. A few times, she had to duck beneath her desk and conceal her cauldron as a prefect walked past the classroom. While she too was a prefect, it didn't cover brewing potions after hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a few hours and a few extremely close calls with one particularly suspicious Hufflepuff prefect, Lily dropped the final ingredient into her cauldron. As a puff of heavy black smoke rose out of her cauldron, she drew her wand. With a triumphant wave, which caused the potion to take on a deep blue hue, Lily finished her option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, that was certainly an adventure!\" She commented, peering into the cauldron. \"I think James is having an effect on me... Urgh... Anyway, I suppose I should call Professor Slughorn about this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking up her stuff, Lily kept sneaking glances at her cauldron. As she zipped her bag shut, she let out a sigh. <br>\r\n \"Although, I suppose a small sip wouldn't kill me...\"<br>\r\nGrabbing a vial from her bag, she dipped it in. The liquid was rather thick, almost like some sort of slime. Its texture almost put her off, however she bravely decided to push ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Down the hatch!\"<br>\r\nTipping the liquid into her mouth, Lily's face scrunched up. It was just as thick as it looked, and tasted worse. And that was just the beginning of her woes...</span></div></div>",

Urgh, so hungry...\"<br>\r\nAs another gurgle emitted from her stomach, Lily was hit with an unusual and heavy hunger. She let out a whimper as she clutched her stomach, which suddenly felt devoid of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I feel... so... so... hungry... The kitchens...\"<br>\r\nStumbling out of the potions classroom, Lily didn't even check for the persistent Hufflepuff prefect before charging in the direction of the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the portrait of the fruit bowl in a surprisingly quick time. She stared at the picture for a few seconds, images of her gorging herself on fruit flashing through her head, before she reached out a shaky hand and tickling the large pear. It giggled at her touch, the painting swinging open to allow the starving Gryffindor into the kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the large kitchen of Hogwarts, a barrage of various smells instantly assaulted Lily's nose. She could smell breakfast dishes, as well as some leftover dinner dishes and deserts. Looking around the kitchen, which was thankfully devoid of any house elves, her emerald eyes fell on the Slytherin table, which was stacked with various plates and bowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily slowly wandered over to the table, her stomach grumbling and growling. She reached down and grabbed a cold chicken wing in one hand, and a couple of sausages in the other. Lifting them to her face, she breathed in their heavenly aroma before tearing away a huge chunk of chicken, followed by a mouthful of sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chewed madly, moaning as she tasted the divine food of Hogwarts. She had been here for five years, but she felt as though she was just tasting this food for the first time. Quickly polishing off her chicken and sausages, she swiftly moved onto her next meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the ravenous Lily to be consumed by gluttony and greed. Her rational mind melted away, replaced with a single thought. <br>\r\nEat. <br>\r\nAnd she obeyed. Plate after plate of food vanished into her. Her feast only stopped temporarily for Lily to guzzle down some Pumpkin Juice, however she quickly returned to her stuffing session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed...</span></div></div>",

No matter how much she stuffed down her throat, she never got tired or felt full. In fact, the more Lily ate, the hungrier she seemed to feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need... more... food...\"<br>\r\nWith the plates within her reach now picked clean of everything, including crumbs, Lily dropped herself into a seat partway down the table. With food once again in reaching distance, she resumed her quest to fill herself with the best food Hogwarts had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly. Empty plates, bowls and glasses began to pile up around the ravenous redhead, who still seemed to be nowhere near done with her feast. <br>\r\n\"Need... more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith blank eyes, Lily shifted herself up the table, where she was greeted by even more plates piled with deserts. She quickly resumed, stuffing treacle tarts, trifles and half-melted ice cream into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the plates emptied once again, Lily prepared to move herself up the table once again. Planting her hands on the bench, she began to push...<br>\r\n\"Why... can't I... move?! Need... more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeprived of her new addiction, Lily's eyes regained colour. She looked around, visibly confused by the mountain range of empty plates she had created. <br>\r\n\"The kitchen? Why am I here? And why do I feel so... heavy...\"<br>\r\nLooking down, Lily's eyes widened. Her hands clapped over her mouth, muffling the scream that followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing against the table in front of her was a pale sphere of solid flesh. It sat heavily atop her thighs, both of which seemed to spread over the bench a little more. <br>\r\n\"Oh god... What's happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shaking hands that were covered in grease and melted ice cream, Lily gingerly poked her new belly. She recoiled in disgust before moving her hands upwards to her much rounder breasts. Rather than the svelte breasts she used to have, two melons of flab now sat on her chest. Her bra was stretched painfully tight over the two globes, leading Lily to reach around and take it off altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her bra aside, Lily tried to shimmy out of the bench. However, between her massive belly and fuller ass, she was wedged tight...</span></div></div>",

A look of worry appeared on her face as she gently rubbed her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't sound good...\"<br>\r\nHer belly let out an gurgle. Lily let out a groan as she felt her belly begin to shrink, the food within it beginning digestion. <br>\r\n<i>Already?!</i> Lily thought worriedly. <i>Digestion is a process that's meant to take time! Not happen about five minutes after eating!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing against the scientific principles of digestion, her belly rapidly digested her meal. As it slowly lost mass, the rest of her somewhat lithe body gained weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts, free of a bra, free rounder and heavier. Within her jumper, they sagged downwards to rest atop her shrinking belly. Beneath her, her ass cheeks swelled. They began to poke out from beneath her skirt, however as she was clad in her robes, nobody would be able to see this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pretty face became rounder, her cheeks bulging out slightly and a second chin started to form. Her thin arms became thicker, now brushing against the inside of her baggy robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly shrunk down to a potbelly that forced her jumper up slightly and poked out from between the buttons on her shirt, Lily, who had shut her eyes so she wouldn't have to see her body swell with fat, reopened her eyes. Seeing her noticeably thicker form, she resisted the urge to let out a wail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can fix this... I know I can! I just need to get back to my cauldron, analyse the potion and come up with an antidote! And then, I can brew up a Thinning Tonic and fix my body! Easy-peasy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Lily made for the hole in the wall. As she crawled through it, she felt her body grind against both sides of the wall. As she crawled out and landed, she felt her belly and breasts bounced lightly. And as she made her way towards the potions classroom, she felt her thick thighs brush against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hate this!</i> She thought as she entered the entrance hall. <i>I hate this so much! Hopefully I won't be like this for too much longer...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lily crossed the entrance hall...</span></div></div>",

She could already feel control of both her body and mind being yanked away from her. \"I was so... close...\"<br>\r\nHer vibrant green eyes dulled as her mouth fell open slightly. Turning slightly, she started towards the Great Hall, and the promise of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily lumbered into the hall, stopping at the door. It was still rather early, the enchanted sky above her still cloudy and dark, so the hall was near deserted aside from a couple of Ravenclaws that seemed to be having an intense discussion about something, and a single Slytherin girl that shot her a dirty look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in her ravenous state, Lily paid them no attention. Instead, her attention was focused on the food slowly appearing on the Gryffindor Table. The scent of fresh bacon, eggs and sausages reached her nose, causing the starving girl to resume her slow journey towards her new addiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the centre of the table, Lily fell onto the bench, which let out an audible creak. Her plump backside spread out beneath her, taking up noticeably more room than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Hungry...\"<br>\r\nA strand of drool ran out of the corner of Lily's mouth as she leaned forward. Using her hands, which still bore remnants of her earlier meal, she began to shovel food into her mouth. Sausages, toast, bacon, eggs and beans were all forced into her mouth, which Lily made sure to keep stuffed full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute into Lily's second feast, and it became apparent that she was slowly getting more and more careless. Food fell from her hands, landing on either the table or on her lap, where it was quickly forgotten. Grease and tomato sauce dribbled down her chin, dropping off it and landing in the forming mountain of dropped food in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute passed. By now, the other few people in the hall had taken notice of Lily, who was now grunting and moaning with satisfaction as she continued stuffing her face. The Ravenclaws watched with disgust, while the Slytherin girl had an amused smile on her smug face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the attention, Lily continued her quest to fill herself with as much food as possible. Ramming a sausage into her already overtaxed mouth, she chewed loudly, letting out a loud belch as she swallowed. Leaning back on the bench, she caressed her belly, which had returned to its earlier state of being a rock-solid orb of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... good...\" Lily moaned. \"Need... even... more!\"<br>\r\nAs Lily leaned forwards again...</span></div></div>",

As much as you want!\"<br>\r\nThe stranger kept encouraging her to eat, which seemed to make Lily eat faster and faster. Her red hair whipped around her as her arms shot out at lightning speed, grabbing anything within her reach. Any plate she finished was quickly replaced by the stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, Lily's belly continued to grow. The buttons on her shirt strained to hide it, however their attempts were in vain. As Lily swallowed a handful of bacon, they pinged off, one after another, shooting across the Great Hall. Her belly, packed full of food, began to pressing the edge of the table, causing Lily some discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger, noticing this, reached over. Their petite, almost feminine hands gently pressed into the top of the sphere of flesh. With a quiet grunt, they pushed it under the table and out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the pressure on her belly dissipate, Lily sped back up. By now, anything resembling manners had been long thrown out the window. She ate with her mouth wide open. She moaned and groaned when she swallowed. Her hands were covered in grease, sauce and some pumpkin juice. And the top half of her shirt and robes were stained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Lily noticed none of this. All she really cared about at the moment was it there was food within grabbing range. And at the moment, there... wasn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily blinked, her mouth agape. She looked to her left, where the stranger who had encouraged her to eat had sat. The bench was empty, no traces of anybody having sat there recently. As she wondered where she had wandered off to, Lily's mind slowly began to return to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... did they... Actually, where... am I?\"<br>\r\nLooking around in confusion, Lily spotted a few Ravenclaws shooting her disgusted looks from across the hall. She stared at them for a few moments, before a gurgle from her belly forced her to look away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking under the table, Lily just about managed to stifle her scream. Her belly was huge! It sat between her legs and forced them to sit at an uncomfortable ninety degree angle. Her arms weren't long enough to find out just how big it was, but she could feel it pressing against her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to get out of here!</i> Lily thought desperately. <i>Let's just hope nobody sees me like this...</i></span></div></div>",

She had no idea how she was going to walk with a belly that was big enough to brush against her knees, but she was going to have to if she wanted out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she began to stand, her stomach let out an incredibly loud gurgle. Lily's eyes widened in fear and shock. She dropped back into her seat, unwilling to have the Ravenclaws notice her freakish belly. She looked around nervously, expecting her ravenous alter-ego to take over and resume her stuffing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Lily remained in control of her body, leaving her somewhat bewildered by the sounds her belly was now making. <br>\r\n\"If it isn't hunger, then it must be... Oh, bugger...\"<br>\r\nLetting out a groan as she realised what was about to happen, Lily pulled her robe tight around her. Hopefully it was big enough to hide what was about to happen to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting out the loudest and longest gurgle yet, Lily felt her belly begin to shrink at the same time the rest of her body began to grow. Her breasts swelled bigger and bigger, the buttons on her shirt slowly stretching until they were millimetres away from blasting across the room. Her breast flesh bulged out from beneath the gaps, helping to strain the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLower down, her skirt was struggling to hide her thickening hips and fattening ass. She groaned quietly as the waistband began to dig into her swelling lower body. Her hands poked around for the waistband of her skirt, however it was hidden by fat bulging over the top of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly shrunk down to a not-so-generous gut that Hum g down over the waistband of her skirt, Lily struggled to her pudgy feet. She attempted to button up her robe, however her hopes of it hiding her body had been dashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once baggy sleeves had been completely filled with her fat arms, while her belly prevented her from buttoning it. And even if she could, chances were high that the buttons would quickly ping off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, I'm so fat!</i> Lily thought, tears threatening to form in her eyes. Reaching up to wipe them away, she felt her round cheeks and second chin wobble slightly. <i>I really hope a Thinning Tonic will fix this... I don't think I could handle losing all this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her robe around her as best she could, Lily started to leave...</span></div></div>",

And honestly, who could blame them? She had put on a noticeable amount of weight and was practically bursting from her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just get to the dungeons...</i> Lily told herself, forcing herself to look ahead. <i>Brew a Thinning Tonic, dispose of that mysterious mix and never think of this again!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAbout halfway to the exit, Lily stopped when she heard numerous footsteps approaching the Great Hall. A second later, a horde of people appeared in the doorway, their crimson badges gleaming brilliantly in the early morning sun of the enchanted roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No... Anything but this...</i><br>\r\nWith no visible way through the approaching horde, Lily spun on her heel, making a face as her belly and breasts swayed and bounced. She hurried back to her table, dropping into the bench and pulling her robes tight around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGryffindor's marched past her, discussing their classes and the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. <br>\r\n<i>Keep walking... Just keep walking...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her relief, the vast majority of her house ignored her, aside from one group. <br>\r\n \"Morning, Evans!\"<br>\r\nLily cursed internally as a guy with messy black hair, a set of round looked glasses and an equally crooked grin dropped into the bench opposite her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"James...\" Lily muttered, keeping her head low so he wouldn't see her round face. <br>\r\n \"Good morning, Lily!\"<br>\r\n \"M-Morning...\"<br>\r\n \"Evans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Lily was surrounded by the rest of James's group. Remus Lupin sat next to her, his scarred face pale and tired. To her other side sat a rather weak looking guy, Peter Pettigrew. And next to James sat a handsome guy with long shaggy hair and a grin matching James's, Sirius Black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And how are you this fine morning?\" James asked, piling his plate high with food. \"Ready to see me dominate in Quidditch?\"<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I suppose...\"<br>\r\nLily's voice was barely audible over the din of the Gryffindor table, yet James didn't notice this. He began to talk about his brilliant strategy about catching the Snitch, the rest of his group listening intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"... And that's that!\" He finished triumphantly, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small golden ball with wings. It fluttered around his head for a few seconds before his hand shot out, snatching it expertly from the air.<br>\r\n \"They won't stand a chance against me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's not like anybody does, James,\" Sirius said, taking a bite out of a slice of toast. \"We haven't lost a game since you became Seeker. What start now?\"<br>\r\nJames grinned, nodding in agreement. <br>\r\n \"Why start ever? As long as Lily believes in me, I can do anything! Right, Evans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked expectantly at Lily, who was still looking down at her lap. <br>\r\n \"Hey, you've been unreasonably quiet this morning. Normally, you've told me to shut up by now. Everything alright?\" James asked with genuine concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, it's all good! Just a bit tired!\" Lily laughed nervously. \"Late night studying, you know? Or maybe you don't?\"<br>\r\nJames frowned, obviously not buying her excuse. <br>\r\n \"No, that's not it... There's something off about you...\"</span></div></div>",

She had an idea of how James would respond if she looked up and revealed her sudden gain to him, and it wasn't a reaction she particularly wanted to see. It'd probably involve a lot of laughter, a few hurtful jokes and probably culminate in her getting some sort of new nickname that would ruin her image as the thin, beautiful girl that everybody wanted to know. Then again, for reasons she didn't know, James had been much nicer to her recently. Maybe he'd be willing to help if she asked him privately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwear formed on her brow as James clapped his hands triumphantly. She glanced up at his grinning face, which was staring directly at the greasy plate sitting in front of her. Her greasy plate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You haven't eaten anything yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide. She finally looked up with worry, planning to protest. However, she was a bit too slow as James grabbed his plate, which held a hearty breakfast of bacon, sausages and a few bits of toast, and poured it onto her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There you go! Can't start the day on an empty stomach, right?\" He asked with a grin, replacing the breakfast he had just given away. As he did, Lily's belly let out a wanting gurgle, which made her want to cry. She had been stuffing herself all morning, and now her belly wanted more?! She desperately needed to get out of here and back to the Potions Classroom before her new body was revealed to the entirety of Hogwarts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks, but... I'm not hungry...\"<br>\r\nLily flashed James a quick smile before leaving. As she waddled towards the grand doors leading out of the Great Hall, her heavy pace began to slow as her belly gurgled yet again, demanding she feed herself at once. As she came to a complete stop, a whimper escaped her mouth as she felt control of her mind and body slipping away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Food.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only thought in Lily's head as she returned to her seat. Dropping heavily into the bench, which creaked and bent a little under her bulk, her soft hands began to shoot out, scooping up the sausages and bacon James had given her earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she mindlessly devoured her third breakfast, James grinned opposite her. <br>\r\n \"That's the spirit, Evans!\" He said enthusiastically. \"Can't start the day on an empty stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily didn't respond to him, her mouth stuffed full with sausages. She chewed madly and loudly, attracting looks of disgust from the Gryffindors sitting around her. Even the Marauders looked a little repulsed by her careless eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lily cleared her plate, save for a burnt crust. However, her semi-solid belly wasn't satisfied and growled loudly, demanding more food. Lily complied, reaching out and grabbing James' plate. Ignoring his 'Hey!' of protest, she practically poured its contents into her mouth. Butter and grease decorated the lower half of her face, not that she particularly cared. All she wanted, no... <i><b>Needed!</b></i>... was more food...</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the bewildered looks of James and his friends, she leaned over Remus, who sat next to her, and grabbed a massive platter of bacon. A few students who had been enjoying the bacon let out cries as their bacon was yanked away from them. One tried to snatch the platter back, but quickly stopped when Lily levelled her wand at their hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatter in front of her, Lily began to ferry bit after greasy bit of bacon to her ravenous mouth. As she ate, she was vaguely aware of a cold, yet somewhat familiar, presence hovering over her left shoulder. She could feel a chilled breath on her ear, yet it did nothing to deter her from eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's it, Evans... Eat as much as you can... Fill that belly of yours to capacity... And why stop there? You would look so beautiful with some meat on your bones...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages flashed rapidly through Lily's head. She saw herself a few days ago, a small breakfast of toast sat in front of her lithe frame. A bright flash replaced that image of her with how she looked now. A plump witch shovelling bacon into her mouth with no care in the world. Another flash, and where Lily was sit during her previous vision now sat a huge woman that took up the entire bench. Her face was ringed by numerous chins, her bare breasts quivered as she rammed platter after platter into her grease-splattered mouth. Her belly had replaced the table, her vast feast set atop the pale flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That could be you, Evans... Beautiful... Irresistible... Fat... All you need to do is eat...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by the mysterious voice, Lily pushed her self stuffing into overdrive. Grabbing her wand, she waved it towards a platter of thick sausages. They flew towards her, narrowly avoiding Sirius' head, before stopping in front of her face. Lily rammed the last few bits of bacon into her mouth before waving her wand again, which caused the army of sausages to began storming her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her arms now free, Lily caressed her belly, which was gradually returning to its rock solid state. She was distantly aware of somebody shaking her shoulder, yelling her name. They sounded pretty scared... Should she stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, don't stop... They don't care about you like I do... I only wish to see you blossom... They would only restrict you, try to stop you from achieving your full potential...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled, or tried to, as her mouth was stuffed full of sausages. She needed more food in her... She needed to be even bigger! As big as she could possibly be! Only then would she be happy...</span></div></div>",

As she lifted her wand and pointed it at a pile of scrambled eggs sitting a little up the table, she felt a number of hands grab her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two, one belonging to James and the other to Sirius, went for the arm holding her wand. With surprising force, they slammed it into the table. As she struggled to break free, Remus leaned over and snatched her wand from her grasp. Lily let out a snarl, reaching over with her other hand in an attempt to take her wand back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>See what I mean!</i> The voice hissed in her ear. <i>They intend to stop you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hand drew nearer to Remus, a firm hand shot out and gripped her wrist. Looking up at the owner with wild eyes, Lily froze when she saw a slightly wrinkled face staring sternly down at her. Staring into the face of Professor Dumbledore, Lily heard the voice let out a desperate wail. Dumbledore's gaze moved over to it and, with blinding speed, pointed his wand at it. The tip of his wand glowed brilliantly, the voice letting out a pained cry. The presence rapidly retreated. As it did, Lily's vision began to darken. The last thing she saw before complete darkness was the worried expression of the black-haired boy sitting opposite her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It appears Miss Evans has attracted the attention of something... mysterious. Until we can discern exactly what it is, she is to remain under constant supervision in here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily groaned as her eyes slowly flickered open. The first thing she saw as her vision returned to her was a white sheet draped over her body, three large mounds pushing it up. She stared at them briefly before moving a shaking hand to one of the smaller ones closer to her. As she poked it, a pleasurable tingle raced through her body. The other smaller mound got the same reaction, while the larger one behind them gave her an even more intense sensation, enough for her to let out a weak moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked up as the curtains around her bed were ripped back, revealing James Potter and Professor Dumbledore. James wore a concerned look, his glasses slightly askew, while Dumbledore looked a little more curious. James raced to her side, pulling up a nearby seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, Mr Potter\".<br>\r\nJames froze, looking back at Dumbledore. He lingered near the opening in the curtains, his expression slowly hardening. <br>\r\n \"Are we speaking to Lily Evans?\" He asked sternly. \"Or are we speaking to the gluttonous presence who has taken a liking to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-It's... It's me...\" Lily managed to get out, her throat feeling dry. \"P-Professor... What happened to me... Why do I feel so... so heavy...\"<br>\r\nNext to her, James shifted uncomfortably. He looked back at Dumbledore, who nodded slightly. Turning back to her, James sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're not gonna what I'm about to tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter James had finished explaining how she had acted in front of the entire school, Lily sunk into her bed. Partly due to the weight of her belly and breasts, but mostly because she was beyond embarrassed. In front of everybody... friends, teachers, classmates... She had acted like an absolute pig! And now, she had the body of a pig!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle hand rested on her shoulder. <br>\r\n \"It'll be okay, Lily,\" James said soothingly. \"We can figure this out! I know we can!\"<br>\r\nLily didn't answer him, instead staring at the curtain directly opposite her. After Dumbledore had vanished whatever had attached itself to her, she had been quickly transported to the Hospital Wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr Potter is correct,\" Dumbledore said quietly. \"You are a student at Hogwarts, which is staffed by some of the best witches and wizards in Britain. Rest assured, we will find out what is happening to you. And I'm sure Mr Potter and his Marauders will help, despite being told not to\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded.<br>\r\n \"Of course we will!\" He said enthusiastically. \"We've got me! And Remus, I guess. But mainly me!\"<br>\r\n \"That doesn't really assure me...\" Lily mumbled, a slight smile on her face.<br>\r\n \"See? I'm helping already!\"<br>\r\n \"How is that helping?\"<br>\r\n \"You smiled, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n \"But how does that help me?\"<br>\r\nAs the duo descended into an argument, Dumbledore chuckled quietly. <br>\r\n \"Ah, young love...\" He said, leaving the duo to their argument. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir argument went on for another few minutes, and probably could've continued had James not held his hand up. <br>\r\n \"As much as I'd love to continue, I've got a Quidditch match to play,\" he said, getting to his feet. \"Get some rest, and I'll bring you back a Snitch\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, you won't!\" Lily said sternly, pointing an accusing finger at him. \"You'll return that Snitch to the chest along with the rest of the balls!\"<br>\r\nJames shrugged at her request. <br>\r\n \"I'll think about it,\" he replied, yet the familiar twinkle in his eyes told Lily that he wouldn't even consider it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving at James as he left the Hospital Wing, Lily sighed.

The longer she lay in that bed, the more she became aware of how big she was now. Her breasts and belly felt as though they were growing heavier by the second, pushing her further into the plush mattress, helping her backside, which she couldn't see but could definitely feel, make deeper and probably increasingly permanent indents in the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Everyone should be at the Quidditch game</i>, Lily thought as a shadow flirted across the opaque screen covering her bed. <i>Well, except Madam Douglass and a few Prefects. But they shouldn't be too much of an issue. Just need to keep a low profile, that's all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her wand from her bedside table, Lily pushed herself into a sitting position with an almighty groan. Her soft belly swelled into her lap, pressing against her thick thighs. Pushing the sheets back, she stared at the pale globe of flesh with disgust before swinging her wide legs over the side of the bed. Slowly getting to her feet, Lily pointed her wand at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering a quick incantation, she tapped the top of her wand against her head. Shivering as the sensation of somebody cracking an egg over her head travelled down her body, Lily glanced at her arms. They blended in with the floor beneath her, indicating that her charm had worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All right, here goes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently pulling back the curtain, Lily made her way towards the door at the far end of the wing. As she moved, her belly and breasts, free of any restraints, wobbled and bounced. Grabbing her jiggling breasts in an attempt to hold them still, she quickly let go when an ecstatic moan threatened to escape her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lily made it to the door with only one close call. A patient had called out for Madam Douglass when she was at the door of their bed, startling her. Almost tripping over her own feet, Lily had just about managed to dodge the approaching hospital matron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank goodness my Disillusionment Charm is so powerful</i>, Lily thought as she slipped out the door. <i>Otherwise I definitely would've been seen. Now, I think I should head down to the Dungeons, see if that potion is still there. If it isn't, then I should be able to brew it again, provided nobody has cleaned up my desk. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoal in mind, Lily started towards the distant dungeons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the classroom, Lily let out a sigh and collapsed onto a stool. It quickly vanished from view as her ass spread across its surface, but Lily didn't care. For the past five minutes, her barely covered body had been on full view, her charm having worn off as she had entered the Entrance Hall. Thankfully, nobody seemed to be patrolling the Hall nor the Dungeons, making her journey a little easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, let's see here...\" Lily mumbled, pulling her cauldron close. Peering into it, she sighed through her nose. \"Damn, somebody got rid of the potion... Well, I've got the raw ingredients here. Shouldn't be too hard to brew another batch\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning the ingredients with her wand, Lily took a deep breath before beginning the brewing process. Despite the rarity of some of the ingredients, it wasn't a particularly challenging potion to brew. Sure, there were a few sections that needed the brewer to be exceptionally careful, but they didn't worry Lily. She was good at Potions, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, Lily relaxed in her stool and stared at her cauldron, a deep blue liquid bubbling within it. <br>\r\n \"That's that!\" She said happily. \"Now, if I can just analyse the potion, I should be able to come up with some sort of antidote. Then, a simple Thinning Tonic should be able to fix me! At least, I hope so...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grabbing a ladle, Lily transferred a generous helping of the thick blue substance into a flask. She watched it curiously as it continued to bubble gently for a few moments, the surface gradually falling still. When it did, she slowly made her way around to the other side of the desk, where she had set up a few tests to determine just what the potion was meant to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was an instrument she couldn't quite remember the name of because of how long and overly complicated the creator had made it. Nevertheless, she knew what it did. It would magically isolate each ingredient, yet still have them act as though the potion was whole. By doing this, she could see what each individual ingredient contributed to the potion as a whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dribbled a little of the potion into the apparatus, she caught a whiff of its scent. Despite the potion being incredibly thick, almost goopy, it had a... tauntingly sweet scent. Lifting the top of the flask to her nose, Lily took another deep breath, sighing happily as the delightful scent filled her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urgh, it smells so good!</i> Lily thought, staring longingly at the liquid. <i>Maybe I brewed it differently this time? I did use a little more Hellebore Syrup this time around. That's probably it, yeah... I wonder if it had an effect on the taste? It tasted absolutely horrid last time, and there's no way it could possibly taste any worse this time. Maybe...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the flask onto the table, Lily stumbled backwards, belly bouncing as she did. She stared at the flask with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I will <b>not</b> have any more of that... that <b>stuff</b>... enter my body!\" She said defiantly. \"I am here to research it and come up with an antidote, and then I'm done! Now, let's see here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the flask again, Lily prepared to activate the apparatus when a familiar, chilling whisper echoed around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why not indulge, Evans?</i> It asked, causing Lily to pause. <i>If a small sip gave you a body this beautiful, imagine what an entire cauldron would do for you... You would be so big, so indescribably beautiful, nobody, not even I, would be able to resist you! So go on... Take the plunge. We both know you want to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the flask clutched in one of her soft hands, Lily could tell her objections falling away. The flash slowly began to draw closer to her mouth, which opened gradually, preparing to accept the deep blue liquid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, don't do it!</i> Lily screamed internally, but it had no effect. Her body poured the contents of the flask down her throat. Unfortunately, the extra syrup had done nothing for the thickness or the taste, causing the redhead to flinch slightly as she swallowed the goopy stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it flowed into her belly, Lily felt control of her body wrenched away from her. It marched itself over to her cauldron, where she poured another few flasks into her body. With each one, her belly let out increasingly louder groans until it was practically roaring, demanding she be fed immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect... Perfect!</i> The voice cackled. <i>Now, I believe you know what to do now, Evans?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-No... I don't wanna... go... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily 's defiant thoughts slowly died out, replaced by one singular one that her body put there for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Food. </b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoal in mind, Lily lumbered towards the doorway...</span></div></div>",

Her mind had no idea where her body was taking her, but wherever it was, it was bound to be filled with food. Delicious, fattening food... All for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, all for you...</i> The presence whispered into her ear. <i>No need to share... I wish to see you blossom, to grow bigger and more beautiful... After all, the bigger you are, the better my own feast will be...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the voice cackled madly, Lily's step faltered briefly. Her brow furrowed as she processed what had just been whispered into her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Their feast?</i> She thought. <i>What does that mean? And what about my own feast? It's much more important that whatever that voice wants of me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mind hazed over with thoughts of fattening treats, Lily reached her destination. Before her towered a portrait depicting a bowl of fruit. For a moment, she had the oddest feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but quickly dismissed it as one of her plush arms reached out and lightly tickled the pear. It giggled under her touch before the entire portrait swung forwards with an echoing creak, revealing a hole in the wall. Lily stepped forwards, hands entering the hole, before pausing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't fit down there</i>, she thought, staring down at her belly. <i>Unless...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her wand from her almost inaccessible pocket, Lily pointed it at herself and muttered a couple of words. An oily feeling descended over her body as she haphazardly stuffed her wand back into her pocket and started forwards again. Navigating her hefty bulk into the small hole, she effortlessly dragged herself along, the spell doing its job of making her body absolutely frictionless and allowing her to slide her body through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the other end, she dismissed the charm before lumbering forwards a few steps, where a tantalising scent reached her nostrils. Laid out before her on four separate tables was lunch for the entire school. Platters upon platters of sandwiches, roasted foods and other delectable treats reached out before her, all unguarded and ready for eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Lily dropped her flabby ass onto a bench, which cracked and groaned under her weight, and began eating. Initially, she savoured everything that entered her mouth, chewing it until it was mush and easily swallowed, but as time passed, food was practically stuffed into her mouth and swallowed almost immediately. Lily found herself choking on various things a number of times, but thankfully she had pitchers of chilled Pumpkin Juice on hand to wash the offenders down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the speed she was eating at, it didn't take long for Lily to empty an entire quarter of one of the tables. As she desperately licked grease from her fingers, she eyed her belly, which had swollen far beyond anything she had sported before. It pressed heavily into the table before her while also lightly brushing against the cold stone floor beneath her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's it, Evans...</i> The voice breathed into her ear. <i>Eat it all... And when you do, you'll finally be ready... You'll taste so indescribably delicious...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the obvious malice behind the Entity's words, they did nothing to dissuade the gluttonous Lily. Rather, they seemed to encourage her mindless stuffing, the redhead now using her wand to pull food out of her reach towards her, where her other arm snatched up anything remotely edible or drinkable and stuffed or poured said item into her mouth, which hung open in eager anticipation of its next treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a polished silver jug of Pumpkin Juice flew into her outstretched hand, Lily froze as she spotted something on the surface of the jug. Leaning on for a closer look, she made out a round figure, their body covered by a dark cloak. If it wasn't for how wide their reflection looked, she could've sworn it was a Dementor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, you can finally see me...</i> The voice cackled. <i>I suppose we're nearing the end... Prepare to gaze upon my figure...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nTipping the contents of the jug into her mouth, Lily let out a long burp before attempting to turning her neck to look behind her. After a few tries, she managed to catch a glimpse of the dark figure. When she did, her mind instantly emptied, even the thought of food being driven out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating about a metre behind her was a tall, hooded figure, similar in appearance to a Dementor. However, what set it apart was the fact that figure behind her appeared to be much wider than a Dementor. A hefty but peaked out from beneath its cloak, allowing Lily a look at its cold, grey skin. Its chest had swollen outwards into two mounds, but didn't give anything away regarding its gender. Thick, grey hips and a round ass gave way to wide thighs that just ended, fading into the air beneath the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lily gazed at the figure's head, she heard its cold voice bounce around her empty head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>You gaze upon that which does not have a name...</b></i> It hissed. <i><b>Some mistake us for the Wardens of a far-off prison... Others claim we appear at random, attracted to certain individuals... But the truth? We appear to those who would only give us more power...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"More... power...\" Lily repeated mindlessly, her mouth still hanging open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Yes, Lily Evans... For us, our power stems from our weight... The bigger one is, the more room they have to store power... And the best way to become bigger? Eating those who allowed gluttony to rule their actions... We take their fat and add it to our own... And in rare cases, we can do a lot more...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Eating... those... who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after the Far Dementor had finished speaking, Lily's blank mind managed to process what it had just said. She had no idea what it had just said, but it had mentioned eating... That was good, right? She wanted to eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Yes, eat!</b></i> The voice laughed. <i><b>The more you eat, the bigger you get! And the bigger you get, the more delicious you'll be for me...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the figure faded into a light grey mist, Lily's gluttonous mindset descended upon her once again, and her massive feast resumed. Picking up where she left off, plate after plate after goblet was summoned towards the slowly swelling witch, who was completely oblivious to how big she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her brief, one-sided chat, her body had begun to digest what was within it, distributing the fat all around her frame. The t-shirt and pants given to her by the Hospital Wing began to stretch around her body as it grew until, finally, they ripped down the sides, revealing the entirety of her growing frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's once beautiful face had devolved into a mess of crumbs, juice and flab. Three soft chins now encircled it, while her cheeks had rounded out considerably. Almost touching her lower chin was her massive chest, which was being forced upwards by her belly. Each breast, nearing twice the size of her head, sagged down either side of her belly, which had split into three uneven rolls. The lowest roll, which dragged against the floor, seemed to be perpetually stuck between being soft and firm as her stomach struggled to digest her never-ending feast. Slowly enveloping the bench she was sat on was her ass, which was approaching loveseat size, and thighs, which were rapidly approaching the size of tree trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as huge and heavy as she was, Lily was only interest in growing bigger, her sharp mind poisoned by the dark being that eagerly awaited its meal...</span></div></div>",

Her once brilliant mind had devolved greatly, reduced to something that only ever had one thought running through it; 'Food'. And as for her body, it continued to swell outwards, anything and everything she ate being immediately turned into soft flab and distributed over her form. And while Lily mindlessly stuffed herself, the Entity watched gleefully, enamoured with how its meal was turning out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, Lily's feeding frenzy came to a slow end as her fingers became too far to curl around her wand. The magic wooden stick fell from her grasp, rolling down her expansive body for a few seconds before disappearing between two of her many rolls of fat. And with her wand gone, Lily could no longer summon food to her side, disappointing both herself and her gluttonous Entity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fooooood...\" Lily moaned sadly, her fat fingers wiggling uselessly. \"Want... more... food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShimmering into existence next to her, the Entity eyed its soon-to-be meal hungrily. By now, she had gone beyond what it had been hoping for. Her body was so big, it probably could've fed, at the very least, three others like itself. But, it was not the sharing kind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Evans...</b> It hissed, running a clammy hand down her flab-ridden face. <b>I believe you are now ready... Ready to be eaten!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind gone, Lily didn't recognize the malice behind that statement. However, she did recognize one word the mysterious figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eaten?\" She asked hopefully, her green eyes lighting up. \"More food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Entity cackled, both hands extending outwards to rest on either side of Lily's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yes, more food!</b> It laughed coldly, its hooded head drawing closer to her own head. <b>But not for you, no... It's my turn to eat now!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled moan escaped Lily's mouth as the Entity's head connected with her own. Feeling cold lips on her own warm ones, Lily's mind worked to try to process what was happening. But by the time it figured out the answer, it was already too late for the immobile redhead. Her eyes gradually fluttered shut as the Entity exhaled into her mouth, lulling her into a magical induced deep sleep. As soon as its prey exhaled through her nose, signalling that she had fallen asleep, the Entity began to feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back its hood to reveal a sunken and gaunt face, its cold lips curled into an equally cold smile. Opening its mouth, its jaw cracked as it opened wider and wider until it, with great difficulty, could fit around Lily's enormous body. Eager to feed, it lowered its open mouth, first enveloping Lily's head. Its dead tongue ran over her plump lips, the Entity moaning as it tasted how truly delicious its meal would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToying with her head for a few moments, the Entity then resumed its journey downwards, taking in her roll-ridden neck and, with some difficulty, her gargantuan bed-sized breasts. Its tongue ran over her two flabby tits, playing with her nipples which hardened in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause to play with her breasts, the Entity found that, rather annoyingly, its jaw couldn't widen enough to take in Lily's belly, which had grown so large that it had toppled not only the table in front of it, but the ones on either side of it as well. But it didn't stop taking her into its body. It had come to far to stop now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an almighty grunt, the Entity grabbed the nearest belly roll on either side of Lily and heaved her upwards. Arms shaking under her immense weight, the Entity began to pull at her, trying to force her into its mouth, bit by bit. Its plan worked slowly, Lily's colossal belly slowly vanishing into its mouth. Once it had gotten past the first three rolls, which were easily the biggest, and the rest of her began to effortlessly slide into its mouth, it lowered Lily back to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Lily's body was beginning to affect the Entity's. Its own hefty belly was beginning to harden as Lily's body filled it. Within itself, it could feel Lily's warm breath heating its cold internals, bringing an odd happiness. It had been so long since it had felt warmth like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, it didn't distract the Entity for long. Now past Lily's belly, all that remained was her lower body. Eagerly, it devoured Lily's ass, pausing briefly to run its tongue over her slightly damp pussy, before reaching out and grabbing the soles of her feet. Lifting her again, the Entity let out a satisfied sigh as it pushed the last of Lily's lower body into its mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You were truly delicious, Evans...</b> It hissed, pleased with its meal. <b>Not long now, and it'll all be over...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrumming its solid belly, the Entity let out a pleased groan as it began to digest Lily's flab and add it to its own body. Slowly, its plump body expanded, powered by Lily's. It's gaunt face took on a healthy shine, rounding out into a familiar feminine shape. Lower down, its ambiguous chest took on more of a definition, two small shapes poking through its grey robes. Its belly softened as within it, Lily's body gradually shrank, her flab being siphoned off to her host. And finally, its hips cracked outwards, taking on a decidedly feminine shape, while its ass grew rounder, peeking out from beneath her grey robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's almost over now, Evans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's voice echoed around the empty kitchens, however its source was not the slumbering Lily. Rather, it came from the Entity who, by the second, seemed to be taking on a more humane shape. It's whispy legs slowly solidified until two thick legs formed, allowing the Entity to drop to the ground. Its grey robes seemed to darken until they melted away from its body, leaving it completely naked which, for some reason, made it feel embarrassed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Human emotions...\" The Entity realised, running an ivory skinned hand over her scalp, where a red fuzz could be seen growing. \"So, this is what it's like... Oh, I feel so... so happy! Thank you so much, Evans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCradling her belly, the Entity grinned evilly as she finished digesting her meal. The original Lily, unaware that she had been been eaten, melted away, her essence and magic acting as a catalyst for the Entity to assume a human form. Her human form...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, there's so much I wanna do!\" The new Lily uttered excitedly, playing with one of her soft belly rolls. She had managed to keep hold of her former shape, leaving her looking hefty and round. \"I want to try food, I want to feel the touch of another human, I want... I want to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily laughed coldly, still massaging her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And, maybe along the way, I can guide a few of my brothers and sisters to bodies of their own!\" She cackled. \"Hogwarts won't know what'll hit it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith goal in mind and a body to call her own, the new Lily set forth, eager to live a life she could call her own, but perhaps more eager to introduce a few more of her brethren to a new life...</span></div></div>",

While she looked like a meal fit for a God, as well as having a body it coveted greatly, her gluttony could not be denied. And people like that were exactly what it needed to sustain its race. With others finding bodies of their own, their numbers were beginning to dwindle. However, it wasn't too hard to take somebody and and take their humanity, leaving them an eternally ravenous person that craved what they had lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>New plan, Evans...</b></i> The Entity hissed into her ear, making her pause. She tried to turn her neck to look at the source of the hiss, but with her neck laden down with roll upon roll of fat, she didn't get very far, only managing to turn ever so slightly to the left. <i><b>If all you desire is food, then let it be so!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out its cold, plump hands, the Entity floated around to the front of Lily's body. Willing itself visible, it cupped either side of Lily's face, using her round cheeks as handholds. Leaning forwards, it pressed its clammy lips against her own, surprising the ravenous redhead. Before she had any sort of chance to react, the Entity used its tongue to force open her mouth. With a passage opened, it began to exhale, forcing its dead breath into Lily's mouth and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it began the transformation process, Lily's mind choose to snap back to reality. Eyes widening as she spotted the fat hooded figure that was currently kissing her, instinct told her to push it away. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I... I can't move!</i> Lily realised with a grunt, trying her hardest to lift even one of her flabby arms. She managed to move it a few inches towards the Entity before, with an exhausted grunt, her strength gave out and her arm slapped uselessly back to her side. <i>W-Wand! Where's my wand!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes darting around frantically to try and spot her wand, Lily felt an eerie chill envelop the entirety of her immense form. Thinking little of it and continuing to look for her wand, Lily didn't realise that the chill was the beginning of the loss of her humanity. Gradually, her pale skin began to take on an ashen hue as the Entity continued exhaling into her mouth, its breath reaching deep into her and forcing her soul from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her once ivory skinned body finished changing colours, leaving Lily with a skin colour resembling that of the Entity, she spotted her wand lying on the floor next to an overturned platter. Struggling to reach out an arm to grab it, her already sluggish movements slowed even more until she halted altogether, her eyes drooping lazily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So cold...</i> She thought, her vibrant green eyes losing their colour as they stared at the hooded figure still kissing her. <i>So, so cold... And so <b>hungry</b>...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting Lily's eyes turning a lifeless grey, the Entity chuckled. Soon, she'd be another one of them, damned to roam the world hungry until they stumbled upon a human just as hungry. And only then would she be able to feel something other than hunger racking her guts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Yes, Evans, release your soul!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I... I feel... so <b>hungry</b>... so <b>empty</b>... so <b>lost</b>...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pitiful whimper, Lily finally lost the battle she didn't even know she was waging. With a final puff of air, the Entity purged her soul from her body, completing her transformation. Her fiery red hair lost its shine and colour, darkening rapidly to a dull, dirty grey, while her lower legs slowly faded out of existence. Her form floated into the air slightly before turning invisible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Hehehe... Good luck with your new existence, Evans...</b></i> The Entity hissed before it too vanished into the air, leaving the kitchens empty and in a desperate state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She looks like a prime candidate... And so healthy looking too...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily hovered near the door to the Great Hall, her plush form invisible to the naked eye. Her own eyes were firmly focused on a pleasantly plump First Year sitting at the Gryffindor Table, who was currently digging into a healthy breakfast of sausages, bacon and eggs. However, once one part of the plate had disappeared into her gullet, she reached over and spooned another couple of bits onto her plate to replace what was lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ginny, slow down!\" A lanky red-headed boy next to her said. \"You'll choke if you eat too quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But it's so nice, Ron!\" Ginny answered through a mouthful of bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled to herself. Not only did she have a healthy appetite and a body that vaguely resembled her own, once upon a time, but she had what appeared to be a family as well? It had been so long since she had been loved by anyone, let alone a family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, she'll do nicely,</i> Lily thought as she floated into the Great Hall. Placing herself just behind Ginny, she leaned down so her head was next to her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Hello, Ginny...</i></b> She whispered kindly. <i><b>You look like you enjoy your food...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded through a mixed mouthful of mixed sausages and pumpkin juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>That's good, I like a girl with a good appetite,</b></i> Lily continued. <i><b>Why not eat a bit more? You are a growing girl after all...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny complied, not even questioning the mysterious voice that had suddenly appeared in her ear. Grabbing more and more food and shovelling it into her mouth, Lily smiled as she felt warmth emitting from her new charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Yes, that's it, eat up...</b></i> Lily urged, warm smile slowly becoming hungrier and more malicious. <i><b>Eat up... I desire the body of a girl with some meat on her bones!</b></i></span></div></div>",

By then, a feast would have been made by Helen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovely lady of the house, Helen Parr, was waiting for the chicken to be fully baked in the oven. Near her was the table where most of the food that would be in the mouths of the Parr family was. Soon, it would be sitting in the dining room, waiting to be eaten. Helen has spent some time on the family's dinner. Her work is coming to an end once the chicken is done. In just under ten minutes, the feast will be complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the chicken was taking it time to be baked, Helen started to think of recent happenings around the house. She was starting to notice that Bob was not as chubby as he used to be. Each day, she had noticed that he is losing weight. It was odd to her. Why now? Maybe he just wanted to get healthier or for some other reason. He could be doing this for crime fighting, she wondered. He knows he is not supposed to do that. Whatever it is, she is keeping an eye out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sometime, the chicken was ready. Helen took it out of the oven and set it on the table. Using her powers, her hands increase in size to gather more of the food. She placed them on the dining room table. After that, she marveled at her own work, soon to make the family happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen patted her stomach, signaling herself that she is quite hungry. All the work of a Mother can be quite demanding for her. Day after day, she has been spending time at home watching over little Jack, making sure he is well cared for. Sure, it is great that she is taking care of the baby of the house. However, it can get boring after a while, which is why she has been eating a bit more as of lately. This could explain why her butt has increased in size. All the things to eat in the house were her for the taking. While she ate, she was not bored at all. She was unaware of certain affects that happened on people who eat too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast was ready to be dug into. Helen signaled the rest of the family to dine on her lovely meal.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

She even liked the idea of the weight gain resulting from the future excessive binging. She didn't know why, but the idea of her belly growing softer and her butt widening and growing farther out really turned her on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally, what was the first thing she did when she woke up? She made a huge breakfast.  Mountains of eggs, piles of bacon, and buttered toast stacked a foot high. She wondered, could she finish it all?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Helen was in hog heaven. So to speak. Over the last couple of months she had done the usual house chores, taking care of the kids needs, and made time for herself. Of course, most of that personal time went towards stuffing her face with whatever morsel's she could get her hands on. Frozen dinners, Dash's ice cream, Violet's coffee from the Cafe, and even so far as to eat Jack Jack's baby food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all of this eating accompanied with being retired from superheroing didn't go without consequence which will be described in due time. Let's join Helen on one afternoon as she opens the fridge door to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty?!\" Helen slammed the fridge door closed and re-opened it, \"Still empty?! Agh. Looks like I gotta go to the store.\" the elastic heroin grabbed her purse and the family car keys. Advancing out the door, Helen felt a bump hit her at the sides. She whipped her head around and shrugged her shoulders. Helen hadn't bothered to notice that her hips had grown and were steadily becoming too wide. In fact, she had neglected to notice the one hundred and fifty pound weight gain that had inflicted her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car door swung open to allow Helen to enter bottom first. Again, her massive buttocks had nearly become wedged within the gap a normal person (or Helen a few months ago) could easily fit into. She swung chunky leg after chunky leg into the car. She reached to put her keys in the ignition when she found the reach much harder than before. Probably because her spherical belly pressed against the steering wheel, ceasing her forward movement. Luckily, er elastic power's were able to keep the reality check at bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to re-adjust this blasted seat and...\" Helen fussed again as she looked forward to see her two full breasts partially blocking her view. Her mind didn't want to take into account the fact that they had grown considerably and were resting on her rotund stomach, \"Must've grabbed one of Violet's bra's by mistake. Tch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, using her powers, stretched her neck upward to give her a better view, \"Good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the supermarket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide hips swaying with every stride, a button up shirt that's too tight with a few buttons missing, bra that's about to pop right off, and pants so tight the panty line was visible with two big watermelon sized butt cheeks ready to burst through. Helen was that kind of customer at the supermarket. One who kept a gluttonous eye out for anything that looked remotely tasty. Her tastebuds begged for the latest edition of a sponge cake flavor or fat juicy steak that was on sale at the deli. Despite the fact that Helen scarfed down twenty dollars worth of hotdogs before walking into the store, her mouth watered for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat face wondered around the store, trying to find something delectable, something that would satisfy her newfound appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I buy the diet triple stuffed spongecakes or the oversized half-calorie chocolate filled version...both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen pushed the cart away, somehow ignoring the fact that her belly was doing some of the pushing, and headed down a isle where...</span></div></div>",

Helen then continued her search for food,\" I better get a new bikini, because I haven't swimmer since before I was pregnant with Violet\" she said as she pushed her cart to the next isle filled with food. Helen noticed while in the bathroom that her belly was showing at the bottom of her shirt which was barely buttoned together,\" I might need to get some new clothes\" she said as she left the bathroom. Her belly pressed up against the cart as she pushed to the checkout line,\" that'll be $44.39\" the clerk said to Helen as she noticed who she was and said in her mind,\" wow Helen let herself go, figured she do it sooner or later with three kids, but wow she's gotten fat.\" Helen then paid for her groceries and went home <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Helen arrived at home she felt the car door hit her butt, she then walked inside and stretched her head and looked at her butt,\" Yeah I definitely need some bigger clothes, my butt is trying to escape these pants,\" she then unzipped her pants and the button came flying off,\" I'll just have to wear one of Violets leggings\" she said as she walked into her daughters room and found a pair of her leggings and took off the pants and put on the leggings, the leggings showed off Helens big soft booty, again Helen stretched her head to look at her butt,\" ok let me walk and see how it looks\" so she started walking and she watched in amazement the way her butt looked in leggings.\" Wow I'm gonna buy some more of those when I go shopping for clothes, which I should now but I'm gonna eat me some cake\" Helen said as she walked to the kitchen, her body jiggled everywhere it could. She walked into the kitchen to find her cake and she got a fork and a knife to cut the cake in squares and eat it. She then started eating cake. Ten minutes later the cake was gone and went straight to Helens belly, which had made all the buttons on her shirt come undone which showed off her big belly and her breasts that were about to break free from her bra.\" Ok I know I'm gonna need a bigger shirt, so I'll wear one of Bobs old shirts and go to the clothing store. She walked down the hall and into her and bobs room and she went into the closet and found one of his old clothes and then went into the bathroom and tried it on. Helen took a moment and looked at body, her butt filled with fat but looked astounding in her daughters \"old\" leggings, her belly, full of cake and dough like looking, her breasts, finally broke free from her bra and now rested on top of her belly,\" I better check my weight\" she said as she got the scale from the bathroom closet, she then stepped on the scale. She wait for the numbers to show, she was amazed by how much she put on in a month,\" 216lbs, I'm definitely going shopping for clothes\" she said as she put on bobs shirt, bug she was without a bra,\" gonna have to manage until I can get some more\" she looked in the mirror, her breasts were very noticeable without the her bra, as they laid on her big belly. She walked out of the bathroom walked out of her bedroom and went to the kitchen to get a snack and got into her car and went shopping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the clothing store, she walked in and went straight into the swimming gear section of the store.\" Ok,ooh that one would look good on me, but I should probably get a one piece bikini. Nah I'll get this one, it should fit\" she said as she walked into the dressing room and took off her clothes and put on the bikini,\" well I better get the next two sizes up in case I stuff my belly again, but this fits\" Helen then took off the bikini and put it in her shopping cart and got the next two sizes up in the same bikini. She then made her way to the bra section,\" well let's not get these here cuz they wouldn't fit..... Ok these will do and those over there too\" she said as she went into the dressing room again and tried on bras. Some were too tight and most fit perfectly,\" good that most of them that I picked fit\" she put all the bras that fit in her cart and made her way to the jeans and leggings part of the store. Helen was getting very weird looks from other women due to her clothing. The woman was in her daughters leggings and her husbands old shirt and no bra, no wonder she got so many weird looks from other women. She made her way to the jeans and leggings part of the store,\" time to find some jeans that'll fit, and maybe some shorts if I'm lucky\" she said to herself. She found a bunch of leggings that she liked and put them in her card and then focused on pants, and shorts.\" Now those are some jeans that will go with anything I wear\" so she got the jeans and a couple others and made another trip to the dressing room.\" Ok lets start with these\" she said putting on the best jeans. As the jeans made its way up her body, it got a little tougher to pull them up over her butt,\" come on theses can fit, they have to\" Helen said huffing and puffing as she continued to get the jeans over her juicy booty, she jumped up and down and the only thing that happened was her breasts and belly both went up when she jumped pulling the shirt and showing her belly again,\" a few more jumps and that should do it\" Helen said still huffing and puffing. She continued to jump and her breasts just kep lifting the shirt up and it was almost over to her beasts,\" one more should do it\", she made her final stand against these jeans, she jumped up and got the jeans on, but the shirt was now messed up and was a cover up for her breasts,\" ok let's see if I can fix the problem after all i am a super heroine\" she said with confidence, she tried pulling the shirt down over her belly, but her breasts were making it very difficult,\" ok let's put some muscle into it, or is it just all fat now?\" She wondered, but still gave it a try. She pulled the shirt down over her belly and then looked in the mirror at her body,\" I look......... great, I think the fat suits me good\" Helen said now accepting that she was fat and nothing but fat. She then took off the jeans, with a bit of a slow down but managed, then tried on the rest of her jeans, which all fitted, so she put them all in the cart. She then started making her way to final part of the store, the shirts, tops, jackets. Helen continued getting the same look from all the women in the store but there was one lady who went up to Helen and said,\" did u forget to put something on today?\", \" didn't have any that fit so that's why I'm here\" Helen would reply. She finally made her way to the tops part of the store,\" wow there's some shirts that could go good with those leggings so I bet get those to match\" she said as she picked out all the shirts that went with the leggings and found some shirts that she had on. Helen made her way to the dressing room before being stopped by a sound, GROWLLLL!!!!!! Her belly needed some food,\" better make this quick so I can go eat\" so she started putting on the shirts and the leggings that went together,\" man I think I look pregnant in these clothes when they are together, but maybe I wanna look pregnant\" Helen said after she finished putting on the last pair of shirt/leggings clothing.\" Now time to put on these shirts\" which end up all fitting.\" Time to pay for all of this and go and get something to eat\" she said as she put her clothes back on and walked out of the dressing room and went to the checkout isle,\" that'll be $105.47\" Helen couldn't believe how much money it cost,\" I'll use my credit card for this one\" she said in her mind but she was also thinking of what her next meal was going to be. After she paid for the clothes, she walked out of the store and got into her car and drove to fast food place and got some food and went home and stuffed herself up to 229lbs\"</span></div></div>",

It was a box tied up with steel cables. Bob easily opened it and checked out the contents. It included a plane ticket a pair of swim trunks that were a size larger than he was, but it was ok because it had a draw string, a large t-shirt that was again too large, a wrist communicator, a couple of wads of money, some poker chips and a schedule with a note clipped to it. Bob removed that paper clip and looked at the heading of the note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To Mr. Incedible,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour many years of service have not gone unnoticed. Along with a pay raise, we are sending you on a two week cruise around the Mediterranean sea. Everything is paid for in full.

But before he could pondrr on it for any longer he was being ushered into the buffet area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd man was he shocked.  It seemed like a guy's paradise.

Bob thought he had died and went to heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's showtime.\" He says. He grabs a tray and begins to put burgers, fries, and etc on it. He then eagerly rushes over to a seat. He watches the game and mindlessly eats. He doesn't even look at the tray just searches around with his hands. But when he feels nothing he walks back up the table and gets more. He does this for a large amount of time just munching on food and watching the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dang that was good!\u201d He sighed. His stomach had been stuffed to max capacity, and now stuck out about 3 feet in front of him. His shirt could barely contain the flab, and had risen a bit, exposing more of his gorgeous, round belly. It was most certainly the first thing to enter when he walked through the door, and he grinned as the doorframe grazed it. \u201cSomeone\u2019s getting chubby, eh?\u201d He chuckled and gave his belly a playful slap, watching it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden smack on his belly also caused it to gurgle slightly, and Bob began to feel more gas building up inside. \u201cOh boy,\u201d He gave a pained smile, \u201cHere comes a big one.\u201d He grunted, braced himself, and let loose a mighty BUUUURRRRRRAAAAAAAAPPP!!! That shook the whole cabin. \u201cAhh, that\u2019s the stuff.\u201d Bob sighed as the pressure was released, alleviating him of his stomach pain and bloatedness, and stumbled on into the bedroom where he collapsed on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, after that big meal, I think I\u2019ll take a long nap. It\u2019s my vacation after all, I\u2019m allowed to be lazy.\u201d He grinned as he snuggled up in the bed. He played with his belly a big longer, mesmerized by how big and fat he had gotten in such a short time, before yawning. He was exhausted from all that eating! Curling up under the covers, Bob relaxed and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dream, Bob found himself eating again-actually, being fed was more like it, and by some sexy, studly guys in spandex, who continued to shovel food into his mouth, rubbed his gargantuan belly, and cuddled him. He was huge! He was as big as a blimp, and at least a thousand pounds heavier. He didn\u2019t know if he could move anymore. But he was still so hungry. Fortunately, the beefy guys surrounding him continued to help him eat. Picking up plates of food and handing it up to the guys who were resting on Bob\u2019s big moobs, who dangled foodstuffs in front of his face, watching him drool and lick his lips, before dropping them into his mouth. It was the best food he\u2019d ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*MMPH* You guys are *MUNCH* pretty nice! Thank you for\u2026\u201d A gurgle in his gut stopped Bob, and he froze mid sentence as pressure began to build up inside of him. Grunting and groaning, Bob shifted a bit, belly swaying, and he muttered \u201cMay want to stand back for this\u201d, as he began to release massive amounts of gas from both ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRBLRRRRRRTTTT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as he let out several big, earthshaking burps and farts from his mouth, flabby body jiggling as the gas passed through him. Finally, with one last big BURRRRRPPP he sighed, the pressure gone, and was ready to eat again. The room still stunk though, but he didn\u2019t think anyone there, himself included, minded much. He actually took in a big, deep breath of the stinking air and sighed dreamily. \u201cSorry about that\u2026\u201d He replied in a daze, euphoric from the stench and the relief, \u201cAnyway, as I was saying, thanks for doing this for me guys! I\u2019m ready for more!\u201d He opened his mouth wide, waiting for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other men seemed in awe of his burps and farts, and quickly resumed feeding him, shoveling as much food as they could into his massive mouth. \u201cOh, *CHOMP* yeah! If you guys *URP* feel like it, feel free to-\u201c He was about to say \u2018have fun with me\u2019, but there was no need. The men understood as soon as he stretched his legs out. Immediately, men were burying themselves under layers of his mountainous fat, digging for his \u2018buried treasure\u2019. Bob knew when they did, and stifled a moan as the men began to lick and suckle at his lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his bed, Bob moaned, getting hard, while in his dream, he was close to climax. He grunted and farted a little as more food was dumped into his gaping maw. The men eagerly pigging out on his fat body. The power he had, his size, his slobbiness. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob snorted and woke up as he came, hot sticky stuff being blown all over his gut. \u201cUgh\u2026 What the heck was that about?\u201d He wondered, as he groggily sat up, only to be met by a strange feeling in his belly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He opened the fridge once more to see more food. Maybe he forgot about it the first time he went wild with hunger but he was so hungry it didn't matter. Pulling a chair in front of the fridge he began to scarf food down like he had never eaten in his life.

He was so hungry, he went to the fridge, which was suddenly packed with food, and it seemed like no matter how much he ate, there was still food in there waiting for him. Did he actually just spend last night eating and eating until he fell asleep? He couldn\u2019t believe it, but looking down at his belly, the fridge, and his food-stained shirt, he couldn\u2019t deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stretched and yawned, he heard his stomach start to growl and felt a strange sense of hunger. \u201cGeez, I\u2019m still starving?\u201d He rubbed his gut and looked at the fridge.

He was so hungry though, he didn\u2019t think he cared about that, and resumed feasting on the fridge\u2019s contents, pulling out more and more food and shoveling it into his mouth.

He couldn\u2019t believe how hungry he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to eat, his shirt began to feel even tighter than before, even though it now rode up on his growing gut. His eyes absentmindedly wandered up to the kitchen clock as he ate, before he suddenly stopped eating as he realized how late it was. He was going to be late for the cruise if he didn\u2019t stop! Even though he didn\u2019t want to, he finished eating \u2018breakfast\u2019, and stood up, gut wobbling as he did so.

Make me!\u201d  It felt like a fighting talk, but that would be the biggest mistake he could ever make, and it make the man feeling confident about his devious plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you might regret what you want, young man!\u201d  That\u2019s when the villain heads over and gets the invention that can make Dash the biggest, fatter superhero of them all!

His uncle, Scar had sent word that he wanted to show Simba something important; it was something to do with becoming king.  In Simba's haste, he rushed off without telling anyone where he was going, something that Scar had hoped and anticipated would happen.  This was all a part of Scar's latest plan to usurp the throne from his brother.  He knew as long as his bloodline existed he wouldn't get his chance and nothing short of a frame job on him and Simba would put him on the throne.  Still, he didn't want to get his hands dirty if he could help it.  He had an ingenius scheme, but it all had to go off without a hitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar paced his den, awaiting for all the players to arrive.  To his dismay, Simba arrived sooner than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are those confounded hyenas?\" thought Scar angrily. \"They better not be fooling around and get back here on the double.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Scar,\" Simba said excitedly.  \"So where's the surprise you've got for me?  You said it was abou becoming king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Acutally, what I need to show you isn't here.  It's quite a bit beyond Pride Rock and I couldn't let you go to it on your own.  I will escort you personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was surprised about hearing this.  Leaving the Pridelands was something he was never allowed to do whether he went with others or alone.  Still, Simba's misplaced trust in his uncle and his fantasies of being king made him throw caution to the wind and nod in agreement.  Scar merely smiled and led the way.  Scar had wanted to have his hyenas come with him to escort Simba just in case he decided to leave; it wasn't likely, but Scar knew to air on the side of caution.  The hyenas would discover he wasn't there and head after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they crossed the plains, Pride Rock shrank in the distance before vanishing from Simba's sight.  It was official, Simba was further away from home than he had ever been in his entire life.  \"Are we there yet?\" asked Simba, a slight sign of fear and curiousity in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet,\" Scar replied.  \"Just be sure to stay close.  There are some devious creatures around here.  You don't want to let your guard down around them for a second.\"  Scar had to hold back a chuckle at how ironic his words truely were.  Simba moved in closer to Scar, much to his delight.  The young lion wouldn't dare leave his side with thoughts of the dangerous creatures he was now imagining were lurking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flat plains soon turned to lush jungles.  To Simba it was like an alien world.  Simba was having trouble keeping up through the unusual terrain.  They had also been traveling for quite some time and Simba had missed lunch.  His stomach roared loudly enough for Scar to hear.  Scar had led Simba around on a scenic route to their destination to help Simba work up an appetite, but now that he was feeling revenous, there was no point in beating around the bush.  He led Simba straight towards their final destination, a mysterious structure.  It was made by an alien species long ago, but was now in disuse.  It was covered in vines and other jungle foligage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" announced Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is here?\" asked Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, a palace of course.  Well, what was one, at least,\" explained Scar.  \"I figured, you would like to have some experience as king before you actually become one.  I've got a few friends here who were happy enough to cooperate.\"  With that, a group of hyenas appeared before Simba.  He was frightened at first, but then bowed their heads to him and saw they didn't mean him any harm.  Scar had to make them a lot of promises to cooperate with his plan.  They hid their annoyance of this whole matter from the king-in-waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do now?\" asked Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want,\" explained Scar.  \"You are the kind and us, your humble servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Servants?\" asked Simba.  \"But dad, never talked about everyone like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to each his own.  Everyone in the Pridelands are his servants even if he doesn't call them that.  They obey his laws and do whatever he wishes.  It doesn't matter what they are called, so long as they obey their king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba didn't get what Scar was talking about, just that they would do what he told them too.  Simba then caught a whiff of something in the air and it reminded him of his hunger.  Simba knew what his first command was.</span></div></div>",

Come right this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was led into the palace towards the throne in the center.  Simba stared at it in amazement and turned to his uncle.  He nodded and Simba pounced upon the thrown finding it very comfortable.  \"Pride Rock has nothing on this place,\" he purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simba got comfortable the hyenas got busy bringing in for Simba to eat.  Simba had been a bit exagerative when he said he wanted a lot of food, being in such a kingly mood.  But he didn't expect them to be so well prepared as they returned with more meat than he could fathom.  A single hyena would drag in a gazelle or zebra body while a team of at least five worked together to bring in hippos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all this?\" asked Simba surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you asked for,\" explained Scar.  \"As a king you should only eat the finest food and as much as you like at that.  Please, help yourself and if there is anything else that you require don't hesitate to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be all for now,\" was all Simba could muster before digging into the closest zebra caucous.  It was a fresh kill so the meat was very tastey.  So much so that Simba didn't bother to ask where Scar got it or how he got so much.  Such thoughts would have surely made him suspicious of this whole situation, but his hunger only made him think of satiating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had barely gone through half of the zebra before he stopped.  He didn't normally eat so much as the Pride had to share the food fairly and limit the amount of food they gathered.  It was to keep the balance, but Simba was still too young to fully understand what that meant.  All he knew was that, this was one of the most satisfying meals of his life.  His normally trim body had a small bulge from all the food he had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Uncle Scar,\" he said merrily.  \"That was great, but shouldn't we be heading home soon?  My mom and dad must be worried sick by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" replied Simba, surprised that his uncle would bring something like that up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive me.  I meant, are you sure you are finished eating?\"  Scar didn't mean food the first time he asked Simba.  Scar figured that his parents were worried about him, but there was no way they'd think he ventured all the way here to find him and it was beneficial to his plans to plant a bit of doubt in his heart.  \"Surely, you wouldn't want to stop before becoming completely full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I may have a bit more room, but mom always told me eating too much isn't good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  No.  You need food to grow.  You are the king after all.  Don't you want to be a mighty king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba absorbed Scar's words and quickly picked up where he left off.  He managed to finish the rest of the Zebra much to both his and Scar's surprise.  Simba never felt so full in his life, and only his desire of being a great king pushed him to eat so much.  Scar craddled Simba and placed him on his throne to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Simba awoke and found himself still in the palace.  The zebra he had finished had been removed and nobody was around.  Simba got to his feet, not noticing his meal had digested and his stomach barely visibly dripped down an inch.  As Simba stretched his legs he moved over to the food.  He wasn't hungry, but he was just amazed that it was all there for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry again?\" asked Scar, entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks,\" replied Simba.  He answered a bit nervously.  For a moment he almost felt like his uncle was some intimidating beast, but he figured he was jumpy from being somewhere new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar took a moment to think.  He could encourage Simba to eat more.  A few sweet words and the brat would surely obey him, but it was still too early to predict what Simba would do.  Simba might decide to leave if he pushed him too much.  Above anything else he needed to keep Simba overnight.  If he could do that then everything else would fall into place.</span></div></div>",

As king, you must show them your gratitude and eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there is so much,\" moaned Simba, not liking where this was going.  \"There's no way I can eat all of this.  I mean a zebra if I'm starved, but a hippo is enough food to feed half the pride.  Can't I get the hyenas to eat some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have their own food.  They got this special for you.  Now you don't want to hurt their feelings.  Hyenas don't like having thier gifts so callously thrown back at them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you wouldn't let them hurt me, right?\" whimpered Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, but as King you need to learn to take care of yourself.  You made a mistake and had your servants bring you more food than you needed.  You'll just have to eat through it all.  I'm sure if you put your mind to it you could finished all this in a week or two.  After all I see so much potential in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba blindly listened to every word that was served to him from Scar's silver tongue.  He wasn't hungry, but now he saw this mass of meat as a problem he had to solve and the only way he could do that was to eat it.  He started with a small gazelle and with increasing difficulty he managed to finish it.  His stomach bulged out considerably from it and the pain from his previoys meal returned stronger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One or two weeks,\" thought Simba sadly.  \"At the rate I'm going to be lucky to finish before next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was glad that Simba had started eating again.  The cubs own eagerness to be king was working in his favor.  Now Simba was determined to eat the rest of the meat despite his fullness.  All Scar had to do now was \"advise\" Simba on what to do and lead Simba down the road of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba,\" Scar said, rubbing his nephew's stomach too soothe it.  Simba seemed at east as his fingers danced on his bulging paunch.  Scar was amused that Simba was so at ease like this since he could end his life with ease if he felt like it, but Scar liked to toy with his prey as it fed his own sadistic nature.  \"You are doing very well, but you are still not getting the lessons that I am teaching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you won't tell me,\" sighed Simba feeling relaxed from the soft paw on his belly.  \"You say you can't tell me what I should do cause I have to learn to do things for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely, it is not my place to tell the king what needs to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's eyes widened as Simba finally figured out what Scar was hinting at.  Scar could tell by the look and his smile grew, seemingly friendly to Simba's eyes, but dark and sinister to anyone else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scar bowed as he accepted the task his \"King\" gave him.  He did it also to hide the wicked smile that spread across his face that even Simba would've noticed.  \"As you wish, my King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar suavely moved across the room in an elegant manner and soon left the room.  He poked his head back in the room and told Simba, \"Make sure to sit on your thrown for when your subjects arrive.  You must show them their king in all his 'glory' after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba nodded and made his way to his large chair.  As he moved he noticed his steps were stranger than normal.  They were a lot wider as his stomach pushed them out to the sides forcing him into a slight waddle.  As Simba reached his throne he had to make several attempts to pull himself up as his stomach kept getting in his way.  After several attempts, he fell belly up onto the ground and he took his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being king sure takes a lot out of you,\" moaned Simba as he rested on his back and his belly hung out for all to see.  He caressed it delicately to soothe the pain like Scar had, but he found he lacked those magical claws that Scar had that made it feel so relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar soon led the hyenas in one-by-one after him.  They smelled the food and were eager to eat it themselves.  The food that the hyenas ate that Scar told Simba about was the scrawny morsels they rounded up.  They were plenty hungry, but only refrained themselves because Scar promised them all the food they could ever want if they helped him with his plan.  They halfheartedly bowed to Simba, noticing his large stomach and felt a bit tempted to eat him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Simba asked \"gather the food around the room and feed it too me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar gave a smirk at Simba's words.  He had told the hyenas how to act to Simba.  He figured he learned some kind-hearted traits from his father, Mufasa; Scar intended to mold him into a much colder king more like himself.  When the hyenas heard Simba speak they just burst into their irritating laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  What's going on?\" asked Simba.  He felt really embarrassed that his first command as king was laughed at in such a rude manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Please?'\" asked Scar in a mocking tone.  \"I'm surprised at you Simba.  A king does not act so humbling.  He roars loudly to grab their attention then demands that they obey them.  You can't be nice or nobody will ever obey you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not how my father acts,\" stated Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father is a great king,\" said Scar almost gagging from those words.  \"But you never saw him in his younger days.  He struck terror in the hearts of others if they disobeyd him.  I'm sure you've seen a glimpse of his savage side.  They rest of the Pride prefers to serve under him rather than face his wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm not big enough to do that,\" replied Simba.  \"The only thing that's big is my stomach, but that just makes me look silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be big,\" explained Scar as his serpent tongue continued to spin lies that warped Simba's mind.  \"You have to act big.  A king does not need force of brute strength, but of word.  Get mean and find that roar in you.  That is what has allowed lions to rule over the Pridelands for so many years after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba nodded, doing his best to roar, but was only managing to meow.  His attempts were continually  returned with more laughter than ever.  Whether it was real laughter or just the hyena's false laugh it still stung all the same.  Scar just watched the hurt build up as Simba kept on trying.  His eyes were welling up as he tried to hold back the tears.  At the same time, Simba was also getting quite angry.  Scar was curious to see which way Simba would go.  Would he allow his anger to take control or him and start on his path to being a dark king or give in to misery and end up as a helpless king who wouldn't be able to stand up for himself, let alone others.  Either way, Scar would be able to use either for his wicked plans.</span></div></div>",

The shame and humiliation he was feeling as a King was overwhelming him him.  His eyes grew fierce and he bore his teeth.  His claws revealed themselves under his paws and his breathing grew heavy.  Then in one thunderous roar the entire room went silent.  It was different than the roar that Simba's father would normal give.  It still sounded like Simba's underdeveloped growl just enhanced by all the pent up frustration.  Not a single hyena so much as let out a chuckle.  The hyenas were ordered by Scar to grow quiet if Simba did something like this, only they hadn't done so from the order but out of surprise.  Even Scar had to admit it was more than he expected.  He mostly expected Simba to break down and begin crying being too soft like his father, but Simba did spend just as much time with Scar so a few things from him must have rubbed off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was still breathing heavily.  He had gotten their attention, but wasn't able to think about what he wanted them to do anymore.  Then the familiar scent of meat filled his nostrils.  A moment ago he was too stuffed to eat, but now he was feeling ravenous, his predatorial instincts taking a firm hold on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyenas,\" he growled.  \"Now that I've got your attention I order you to feed me.  Fill my belly full of food this instance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost trembling, the hyenas lowered their heads in shame and formed a line of tearing a chunk of meat and coming before Simba.  The first was about to place it before Simba, but he grabbed it by the face and glared fiercly into its eyes.  \"What didn't I make clear?\"  Simba opened his mouth wide and pointed down his throat.  He then reclined on his back as the hyena put the meat into Simbas mouth and watched him munch it down, savoring the flavor.  The other hyenas followed suit it their servitude of Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" said Scar smugly.  \"This is how you command respect.  If your father understood that the hyenas wouldn't be as much a problem in the Pridelands as they are.  But look at you know.  You've taken a grand step to becoming the kind of king you were always meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba smirked at Scar's praise.  It wasn't a normal smile like he had when he was so eager to be king, but one that was similar to the smile's Scar would give.  Simba then felt a burp come up and belched loud enough that it echoed through the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to say excuse me?\" asked Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" asked Simba, talking with a mouth half full of food, purposely letting the meat bits fly at his hyena slaves.  \"I'm the king and I rule all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, my liege,\" Scar said bowing, knowing his plan was another step closer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say Simba was frightful that first day was an understatement as time passed.  The once carefree innocent child had become malevolent under his uncle's teachings.  His gleamed with a constant ferocity that the hyenas had chosen to avoid.  It was similar to what made them fear and obey Scar, despite him being a lion.  Simba was also well verse at the deceptive arts, seeing full well what his uncle was doing to him.  Already he gut had drooped down to his knees and his legs had widened.  His neck  was reduced thanks to a second chin and if he wasn't so scary the hyenas would have laughed at his bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba knew that Scar was attempting to fatten him up for some devious plan to become the next king.  He found out several days ago; he only faked ignorance since he figured Scar would just use the hyenas to force feed him or even get rid of him.  Until he could come up with a plan to overpower Scar he had to play along.  At the same time he found a strange delight in glutting himself to the point of bloating.  His parents always told him eating too much was bad, but he felt it as a power trip on his deep desire to become king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Scar approached Simba as he finished the rest of the meat he had been given at the beginning.  \"So, tell me, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never felt like this before,\" Simba said in a dark tone.  It was angrier and more savage than his voice used to be.  At first he could only do it when he built up enough anger, but it seemed almost like he was stuck with it now.  \"I like it the enormity of it all.  This power is wonderful.  It rushes through my veins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar chuckled seeing he picked up on his own vocabulary quite fast.  \"So, tell me?

They fearfully approached their king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I require food,\" he said, standing before them, his gut hanging down nearly touching the ground.  For a cub he was overweight, but it didn't make him look any less intimidating.  If anything it proved just how ravenous he had become.  \"Go out and bring me all the food you can find.  Now be off before I take a bite out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas crept away whimpering like little kittens.  Simba let out another angry roar that started them into running away.  He chuckled enjoying at the pathetic creatures.  He had always been afraid of them, but after finding this power within himself he saw how spineless they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have grown quite very good at commanding your servants,\" said Scar caressing Simba's stomach.  \"You are not the weak little runt you were not so long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have you to thank,\" replied Simba.  \"But it is clear that you've just used this as a means to your own desires.  You want the Pridelands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar chuckled.  \"I guess I trained you too well,\" admitted Scar.  \"Perhaps I should get rid of you before you become a threat, but I must say I have genuinely enjoyed this quality time we've have unlike when I was just acting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, even Scar has a heart,\" commented Simba.  \"I see no reason why you shouldn't have the Pridelands.  After all, I have grown content with my life here.  If I help you obtain the Pridelands I assume you would have no trouble allowing me to keep this land for my own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what guarantee do I have that you won't try and attack me when all that is done?\" asked Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same you can give me,\" answered Simba.  The two lions circled one another looking each other over, but before long they both collapsed to the ground laughing.  The two of them were vile, deceitful, cruel, tyrants now, but because of that they were closer than they had ever been and despite all that they seemed to find a kindred spirit in one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the hyenas returned with all the food they could carry, including three hippos.  As they had grown accustomed to, they got in line to feed their king, feeding it right into his muzzle.  It was stomach churning for them to see such a small animal eat so much food, but fascinating at the same time.  Simba ate larger and larger amounts of food to the point he could even made a credible dent in a hippo in one sitting and Simba would normally have five or six meals a day whenever he desired it, even if it was well into the night when the hyenas were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Simba had the last bit of meat slide down his throat he dismissed the hyenas with a wave of his paw.  He had eaten nearly half of a hippo before getting full and was determined to finish it when he got hungry later.  Scar, who had been watching the entire time came up to Simba again.  \"I've been thinking, my liege,\" he said bowing \"as much as I hate to admit I care about you.

This whole scheme was supposed to be one that made me king, but in the time we've bonded, I see you as if you were my own,\" Scar told Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba didn't give it much thought before, but this newfound respect and admiration for Scar had left a mark on his heart. Simba may not have been his by blood, but in this time, he had been remade in his image. This should have been time he spent with his father figure to help him develop into adulthood, but when he thought of his father, all he could think of was Scar and among the wickedness, treachery, and anger, there was love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel the same way,\" said Simba in a rare instant that his voice sounded remotely like it once did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar nuzzled up against his fat side and gently stroked his stomach, not threatening to scratch him with his claws. \"Then from now on... my son... I will make you king.  I will continue to make you a glutton and give you all the power in the Pridelands.  From this day forward, it will be my only aspiration,\" Scar said in a calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba and Scar gave each other a smirk of the things to come that was soon interrupted by a rumble in Simba's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems it is time to feed the beast,\" joked Scar, poking Simba in the gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food!\" roared Scar and Simba in sync, forcing nearly every hyena to rush in and start stuffing the hippo meat down Simba's gullet. Simba ate more ravenously than ever, finding his hunger more intense than ever and now having a strong desire to meet Scar's expectations of becoming a colossal king that he could be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas were soon halted by the tall dark lion. \"I will take over feeding Simba,\" he ordered. \"Just bring me the food.

He had seen Simba gain, but this was the first time he actually felt the difference in his weight. He figured before long, Simba would be too big and fat for him; all the more reason to do what he could while he still had time. He started out feeding Simba lovingly one piece at a time then rubbed his stomach as he chewed to help his digestion. This only continued for a short while since he was certain Simba was more interested in bonding in the way their relationship was formed; with trickery and ulterior motives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar stopped feeding Simba and let the meat stack up. Simba was displeased by this for a moment, but as soon as he realized what Scar was planning, he just waited, not wanting to go against his parent's wishes. When he had a decent stack, he took one and placed it into Simba's mouth. Simba chewed it innocently and just as he expected, another piece of meat was crammed into his mouth. Simba couldn't spit it out as Scar kept a hand over his mouth and reached for a third piece. Simba tried to keep up, but he couldn't keep up as more and more meat was forced in. With little choice, Simba had to swallow down huge chunks of meat, causing a huge bulge to slide down his throat. It was a tiring experience, but he didn't have time to rest as Scar prepared for the next round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that?\" Asked Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba considered how he should respond to Scar and one idea came to mind. \"It hurts,\" He said with tears forming in his eyes. He sounded like he did when he first arrived; small and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar knew what he was doing and played along. \"It's alright, my little cub,\" He said while using all his strength to cradle the obese lion. \"You just need to keep working at it and you'll become a true glutton at last.  You'll be able to swallow huge chunks of food with ease,\" Scar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba nodded as he opened his mouth and waited for the stuffing to resume. Scar continued his pace again, though Simba was showing signs of improvement as he downed food in only a few bites. His early signs of discomfort from eating such large amounts of food at once vanished as he grew accustomed to it. Before long, Simba was eating piece for piece with Scar. The only reason they had to stop was because they finished all the meat that was within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do good?\" Asked Simba with eyes full of eagerness to please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did wonderful,\" Scar said, rubbing their noses together.  \"But don't do this for me.  Do this for yourself.  Have pride in your talents and more so in your greed and gluttony. Let it define you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba took those words to heart and his innocent bright eyed look shifted to an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar placed Simba on the ground and ordered the hyenas to bring a fat, zebra carcass a few feet away from Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must show dominance as a leader. That means you go first and get what you desire. Don't stop until you are satisfied. If they get nothing from the hunt, so be it. Now go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba attacked the food, tearing through it like he hadn't just been stuffed a few seconds ago. Large chunks were torn off and vanished into his mouth. In mere moments, the zebra was just bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's like a piranha,\" cried one of the hyenas while backing away.<br>\r\n\"There'd be nothing for us to eat if he wanted,\" whimpered another.<br>\r\n\"He's a monster!\" finished the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" shouted Scar.  \"That 'monster' is my son and I guess he does take after me. And you will address him as king from now on or if you so feel, monster king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba soon approached Scar again. Once more, he seemed to have changed his personality more towards his dark self that he currently was. Scar felt like he was looking into a mirror, albeit Simba was several hundred pounds overweight. As Simba approached Scar, he seemed to be walking on air, proudly like the king he was destined to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all can have the rest,\" he said, smugly referring to the skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment made Scar laugh. \"Good, my son.  You're truly becoming a great man,\"  He rubbed Simba's stomach to help it digest. \"When you are king, you can have as many females tend to your belly as you want. There'll be a lot more belly by then. Now one last thing,\" Scar told him motioning to the whole hippo remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba looked at it and licked his chops before saying, \"Always eat all the gifts your servants bring to you,\" he stated just as Scar had.  His voice was once again different.  It didn't have that forced darkness that he had when trying to imitate Scar. It was natural and it was his. It may have been coincidence or perhaps some mental stimulation from the bonding. It may have even been fate, but it was clear that Simba was finally an adult. He attacked the hippo and tore away at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar brushed a tear from his eye and thought, \"They grow up so fast!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To the old Simba, a hippo was a meal that would feed an entire lion den or keep him with food for a month. Now it was like a snack to him to barely satisfy his appetite. Scar watched from the sidelines as the meat dissapeared inside of Simba's ever growing belly. Before long, it was reduced to bones and Simba moved on to the scraps he somehow missed and finished them off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it?\" asked Scar as he was approaching a pleasantly stuffed Simba who was licking the flavor of animal meat off his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba let out a belch that reached to the furthest points of the temple. \"It was delicious,\" he replied. \"I can't wait to see what they bring next time and I promise not to take so long,\" Simba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you won't,\" replied Scar, giving his belly another rub.  \"Now we must begin planning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" agreed Simba before he yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you could use a nap,\" replied Scar in a loving parent tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" replied Simba. \"I'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar rubbed Simba's belly to force him to relax and yawn some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. All that eating has really done a number on you. Rest for now, my king, and when you awaken, we will have a plan prepared for your conquest of the Pridelands,\" Scar said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba couldn't argue if he wanted to. The next thing he knew, he was out cold on the floor. Scar looked down on his sleeping king, thinking that he slept just like a little cub and just as innocent as the cub he used to be. He watched him a bit longer before leaving the room with the hyenas to piece together a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba awoke a few hours later feeling the bulge in his stomach had shrank and softened as well as spread throughout his body. He admired the new layers of fat as he walked around enjoying as his body jiggled. His belly rubbed against the floor. He was considering having a servant to keep it elevated, but he doubted walking would be an option for him, at least once he ruled the Pridelands and was seated on his throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you're awake,\" said Scar who was returning to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same to you, father,\" Simba replied as he sat on his throne. \"Have you come up with a plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he replied. \"It is very easy when the enemy is so trusting of both of us. We can practically walk in and take over without much of a fight,\" Scar grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" smirked Simba. \"But I'd rather crush them outright. I'd hate to win without playing the game first,\" Simba said with a fat, evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my boy,\" said Scar. \"But what I want to talk to you about first is your kingly title. You'll need one so all the other animals will know and fear you at just the mere mention of it. After some discussion, I found one that fits you to a tee: King Simba, the Behemoth,\" Scar said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words processed in his mind as he considered them. He had expected something more focused on his girth or his weight, but such names would have been silly. The hyena's laughter would have awoken him to be certain of that. This name, on the other hand, made him sound big and powerful and he couldn't disagree with that. It also reflected on the monster he truly had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect,\" replied Simba. \"It is a name that will be remembered for ages of the king to end all kings,\" Simba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it will,\" said Scar. \"Now then...</span></div></div>",

It is your birth right after all and you already have proven that you are a great king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't anyone be against me?\" asked Simba. \"Surely, they won't be happy at my disappearance or my new appearance. They'll probably dislike my new view of being a king as well and consider it a result of you manipulating me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, all true,\" replied Scar. \"Though that last one is something you developed under my tutelage. It could hardly be called manipulation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but deep down, the other adult lions never trusted you,\" said Simba, recalling how Scar was always prevented from ever truly belonging to the Pridelands and knew such a fate might befall him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I've already set the hyenas out to gather their kin,\" explained Scar. \"By the time we return, they'll be ready. If they accept you back, there won't be a need for it, but should they turn on you, we will have an all out war and turn their home that they selfishly keep for themselves into a war zone. Their choices are simple; they can either live under your rule as citizens... or slaves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there really a difference?\" asked Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is indeed,\" replied Scar, who was grinning devilishly which made Simba smirk back. \"So, let's hope they do this the hard way so you can see how the Pridelands should have been like all along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days passed. It was hard for Scar to bring Simba to Pride Rock with his obese body and they had to travel at a much slower pace. Simba was just glad they did it before returning was completely impossible because the more he thought about his rule over the Pridelands, the more it continued to corrupt him with greed. He only had a handful of servants to care for him in the temple, but in the Pridelands, he'd have more than he could count. He had even made schemes of his own to enact when he ascended to the throne that would make Scar tear up from being so proud like plans to breed the other animals in the Pridelands to make them grow up larger and fatter to satisfy him ravishing appetite. He also thought of forcing them into a more sedate lifestyle to make their muscles weak and their bodies burn less calories. Thinking of having animals born with the sole purpose of feeding him made his mouth water. Once the Pridelands were his, they would be unlike anything anyone could imagine and Simba's greed was already making him think about the lands outside the Pridelands. More food, more power, and more of everything. He would expand his territory to the ends of the known world and further if he could and grow obese enough to cover every inch of it. It wasn't a matter if he could succeed. Simba knew it was only a matter of time. </span></div></div>",

Come back to your family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only family I need is my father, Scar,\" replied Simba.

It was like that well before I was here and it transformed me into the man you see before you, mind you I was much older than you were. Some time spent in here might do your mind and body good that even I could have never taught you,\" Scar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba breathed in the air of the cave.

He was a God and in Simba's dream, that was truly the case. With merely a desire, he could create a mountain and make it erupt. His breaths were terrible typhoons and his belches made the ground split and he did so with great satisfaction.

If it had been anyone else he'd have ordered them to be put to death and end up as food for him.  It didn't matter even if it was another lion and considered cannibalism  To him, Simba was an entirely different animal altogether and knew they should feel honored to become a part of their messiah.  He felt it was a fate too good for them, but they were lucky to have a ruler who was so benevolent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have great news to report,\" stated Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be the judge of that,\" answered Simba getting up and stretching.  He prowled around Scar as he took the time to fully awaken.  \"Speak now, Scar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my sire,\" replied Scar bowing to him.  \"While our forces were coming together a most unexpected thing occurred.  The lions your father, the soon to be ex-king, banished to the bad lands, including my side of the family have arrived.  I had planned to get in touch with them after the battle ended or if we needed more support should the war begin to turn away from our favor.  However, some of the lions were scouting the edge of the Pride Lands in order to scout out some food here.  They spotted some of our hyena messengers and went to investigate.  Hearing that I was involved in this battle prompted them to get involved knowing I would be able to let them return here.  I've already discussed it a bit about them joining our forces and they will come to fight for us, but only if we grant them their liberty afterwards.  This union will also allow for both sides to combine their territory in the end meaning you'd gain even more ground than we both expected you'd get at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is wonderful indeed,\" said Simba, his maw leaking drool as he imagined the land he'd get from this conquest as a fatty piece of steak.  Getting the land from the bad lands meant he'd just get an even bigger piece that before and it only intensified his hunger more.  It was so powerful it made his belly growl for more food to fill it and it echoed through the caves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The news only gets better from there,\" added Scar.  \"Seems word got back to Pride Rock of the sudden boost in our forces.  The gap in our forces and there was already huge and getting bigger as more hyenas arrived.  The lions could use their superior strength to counter the hyenas.  However, with the addition of lions just as powerful and even fiercer and more savage since their exile any advantage they had is gone.  Mufasa probably hoped gaining intelligence on us would give them ore of an advantage, but all it did was demoralize most of his forces.  Some felt the battle was going to be a slaughter on their side they've come to join us here and save their skin.  Whatever he had left when we attack our forces will crush them in a matter of hours and then you can finally take your rightful place as king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I will continue from their until I am god to this whole world,\" cackled Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course,\" replied Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a hyena arrived.  \"Scar, sir,\" he said in a humble tone.  He was cautious of upsetting Scar, but being in the presence of Simba was enough to take the chuckle from his throat.  Though Simba didn't even realize it himself he was already far darker than Scar ever was.  Scar was made dark from his constant resentment of hid brother becoming king over him, but that wasn't until he was a young adult.  Simba, on the other hand, was much younger and his heart still had fertile soil as he was still finding himself.  When Scar planted this darkness in him it ravaged his being from the inside out like a weed growing uncontrollably and choking the life out of the love and light Simba had.  To Simba, darkness wasn't merely a thing that he had come to possess, but a thing that had possessed him.  It was a power that he hoped to one day totally consume him and then consume the world too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lions are here to finalize the details for our alliance,\" he explained.  \"They need to talk to you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" replied Scar.  \"Simba, shall we meet them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba replied...</span></div></div>",

First off, there are two things we must make sure to accomplish to win this war.  The first is to capture all food sources that the Pridelanders have.  Their food is very limited already and quickly drawing more to join our cause.  The other thing we must do is hunt down all the animals that provide us with food, but be careful not to harm them.  They are important for my brilliant plan to create a true paradise for everyone that Mufasa could never imagine in his prime or now.

Simba had no idea what Scar was planning, but knew it was for him, the bond they had kept them from ever being able to betray one another and there was no gain in doing so at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a great plan,\" Simba told Scar.  \"But I wish to add one more thing to this plan.  Nala, order her captured and brought to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever for?\" asked Scar not questioning him, but wanting to see what his beloved son had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still love her and just as you shaped me I know she will come around in time so that I can have my king and soon an heir to the throne.  I think you would love being able to have a grandson and nurture him just as you did for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing could make me happier now,\" replied Scar with a tear in his eyes.  He turned to the lions who weren't as sure how to feel about what they were seeing.  \"Don't just stand there,\" he roared.  \"You have your orders start moving.\"  He turned back to Simba.  \"And a feast awaits you back in your lair.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scars tactics proved extremely effective as one area after another of the Pridelands came under there control.  They didn't need to occupy the land, but simply remove all the food so it became worthless to the lions under Mufasa's command.  Day by day more lions went without eating and their efforts waned as they could barely muster the strength or morale to keep going.  Many defected to join Scar's side just to eat and Scar welcomed them in, grinning to see so many lions so thing their skeletons were showing quite clear under their fur, which greatly contrasted with Simba who was obese beyond what they could imagine.  Any of the new recruits that saw Simba saw this as the promise of a paradise, though they were quick to learn their place beneath Simba's massive paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar recruited a lot of the new joiners to be Simba's personal attendants, to cater to his every whim, but to feed him as the hyenas still did that, but anything else he needed from being groomed to being toys for his wicked cravings.  The lions were glad to do anything so long as they got fed and Simba didn't hold back on what he did to them from sitting on them to making the lick his feet.  Some massaged his blubber and that was a task that took hours.  If Simba's titles had been merely that before he certain was living up to it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The war is progressing as planned,\" Scar reported to Simba one day.  \"Only a small number of lions remain out of our control.  This includes, of course your parents and some of their more loyal followers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Nala I assume?\" asked Simba while a dozen lions were licking his body to groom him.  \"I was hoping Nala would be by my side by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is very willful, but I suspect they will be launching a last assault on us inevitably leading to our total victory.  We will capture Nala then and bring her to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to hurt her too much,\" he told Scar.  \"I want her unharmed so I can bring her around to our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she doesn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will break her spirit and find a more pitiful use for her.  I can always find a new queen elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed you can my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Scar predicted, Mufasa and Nala soon arrived with their meager forced for an attack.  They were thin as can be from rationing all their food and now they had no choice but to fight against overwhelming odds or die.  If hunger did nothing else it made them desperate and aggressive.  They attacked without holding back, but despite some minor success at the start they didn't have the strength to endure and lion after lion was defeated.  In a matter of minutes war had ended and Scar signaled for all the lions to roar so Simba the Behemoth could hear.  The roars echoed through the cave and reached his ears.  In response, Simba grinned showing his pointy teeth.  Drool dripped from his muzzle and down his chin.  The lions around him fled like kittens as they sensed the excitement in him.  Simba had been in the cave for a while now allowing his vileness to grow as the ate.  It was almost like it had mutated Simba from the inside out until he was no longer a lion, but a monster, a behemoth.  It was something Scar had never expected to happen to Simba, but it was far beyond his control what happened to Simba.  If he wasn't so sure Simba needed him he'd be afraid he created a monster that would be the end of everything, but even Simba had his limits and he didn't have the experience as a king do to much without his uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba let out a roar that was more monster than lion as it shook the ground and frightened the heavens.  It was the signal that Simba was accepting their unconditional surrender.  Mufasa and the lions who had chose to fight to the end were all led away to find their fate for defying them to the end, all except Nala.  She was brought to Simba, but she couldn't even look at him.  She hated him for what he had become.  To her, Simba was dead and this was a monster in his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you the chance to be my queen,\" he told her.  \"You will find my way of life will lead the Pridelands to a new paradise.  Why would you want to deny everyone that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is wrong.  All of this,\" Nala argued.  \"I won't have any part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see how you think after another week without food,\" he told her.  \"If you change your mind you can become my queen.  If you survive and refuse then you can join the other who defied me, but that would be a shame to let your beauty go to waste.\"</span></div></div>",

Her already skinny body had grown even skinnier with no food making her body look frail and skeletal.  Simba on the other and hand grew even fatter, eating much more plentiful than before as if to mock Nala's struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's just about time for Nala to come out,\" he ordered to some hyenas who were there to cater to his every whim.  They quickly worked to pull Nala out, finding her as light as a cub.  When she was out she was helped over to Simba who was larger than ever, but there was something different about him then when she last saw him.  She knew he was hardly the Simba she knew before, but he didn't seem quite as malicious as before.  \"Hello Nala.  Have you made your decision yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the same as it has always been.  I will never be your queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked.  \"We are betrothed to one another anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was with the Simba who was my friend, not a monster like you?\" she spat.  \"You are a cruel king who does nothing but harms his people and the world around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we ask a few what they think of my reign as king,\" he stated with a big smile.  Nala thought she could see a faint resemblance of him.  It didn't make sense as to why he would be like this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Simba is the greatest king ever,\" said a lion who was a bit less scrawny than Nala.  His words sounded honest and he didn't seem to feel threatened to answer any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba's reign is truly one that will guarentee everlasting peace and harmony for all animals on his pride,\" replied a female hyena.  Over a dozen lions, hyenas, and other animals came to profess who happy they were with Simba's rule and Simba merely beamed with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you see?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" she replied.  \"How can they say such things when you are a tyrant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a tyrant, but it was all to create a utopia that Scar dreamed up for me to rule,\" he explained.  \"It has only been a week, but things are going well and already all my people are happier now then they ever have been under my old father.  I'd go into more details, but you will see when you go to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work?\" she groaned still feeling weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get some food to get your strength back, but after that you will have to work hard to be able to eat.  The most basic rule of all this is everyone must work or you don't get fed.  That goes for all animals from the cubs when they learn to pounce to the elders who much teach pouncing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is the end of your cruel reign?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Simba replied showing his devious smirk.  \"That hasn't changed, but when you are happy there is no reason not to smile.  But rest assured, I have lots more land to conquer and my dark nature will not sleep for very long.  It is just a shame that you won't be around to see how great I will come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba signaled for her to be taken away while Simba thought about what to do about his queen situation.</span></div></div>",

Still, it left the problem open as to what was to be done about Simba's queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume by the sight of Nala being led off by hyenas that she did not see things our way,\" Scar commented as he entered the room.  Simba was astounded that his beloved uncle turned father would just show up when he was in need of him. \"Luckily there's always plenty of fish in the sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fish are nice, but I want my queen and I doubt there is another as suitable for me as Nala.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old you perhaps, but you desrve a queen who respects your power and will obey your desires,\" stated Scar to his pampered prince.  \"What you deserve is a queen who is all that and more and I've gone through the trouble to find the best matches on the planet for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have?\" replied Simba with great surprise and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not quite that,\" admitted Scar but I have at least looked far and wide over the Pridelands and found you two lionesses capable of bearing you a child and loving you as Nala could not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring them in,\" replied Simba excitedly, but his face blushed red as he lacked some experience that Scar had not had time for during their conquest of the Pridelands.  \"Would it be too much trouble to learn of the birds and the bees?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we never go over that?\" asked Scar with surprise.  Simba nodded a little to verify.  \"We shall, but for now choose the one best suited for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar took his leave as two young lionesses came in.The first was one that was still young and yet to mature into an adult, but looked like it was about her time to.  She was a bit more slender than Nala had been and her fur was a paler yellow than most lions in the Pride.  Her sweet smile showed how pure and unspoiled she was, but would easily change once Simba had his way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Suzu,\" she told Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThatwas all she told him before the next lioness presented herself.  She was quite different, her fur was darker and ruffled showing that she was a great hunter.  Simba recalled seeing her back in his youner days.  She was a child prodigy for hunting and was more skilled than Nala was.  Her body was this, but stongly built.  The onlyt reason Simba assumed she was her in hopes that she'd be finally relieved of the job for good, somethin Spyro could understand.  The way she looked it was clear that she was not simply doing this for an easier time, but she also desired a mate as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Anze,\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just met them so soon and not he had a major decision to meke over which would become his quieen.  Both had their strengths and weaknesses and Simba would have wanted both if he could have been allowed, but one was all he could handle at the moment.  After several minutes of contemplation he made his decision.</span></div></div>",

Also, I find her skinny body very attractive. I will find it even more attractive when she begins to fatten up from my spoiling regime. Also, she has some innocence that I noticed in her.

On the other hand, Simba grinned finding the information incredibly helpful, in particular the part about where babies come from was by far the best part.  He hadn't told anyone, though he was at the age that everyone assumed he had become sexually active.  In fact, before now Simba had no idea what those urges were and only assumed it was just the euphoria of evil.  Now that he was informed he felt just as lustful as hungry and all that energy was pointed as Suzu.  With one growl he cleared the room save for Suzu and himself.  He approached the young lioness and while she didn't cower in fear she could sense he was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something I can help you with my king?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me that you are in heat,\" cackled Simba.

With Scar to help him, he had selected a group of his fiercest and most loyal lions and lionesses and even some other beasts they deemed worthy to become his generals and lead their forces where they were not able to be at the time.  The world they discovered beyond the Pridelands was even more vast than any of them expected, but that didn't make them hesitate from conquering it first and asking questions later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's army was constantly starving and devoured whatever prey they encountered, just as Scar had planned.  They soldiers were carried on their stomach and at each new territory they created farms to feed and fatten the fodder animals to become a new food source for everyone.  Naturally, a generous portion of the best fodder animals was brought back to the Pridelands for Simba to enjoy.  The great, fat king had continued to grow bigger and fatter in that time, his size vastly larger than an elephant and weighed more than a herd of them.  Pride Rock was hardly a home to the lions now as much as it was a throne befitting his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis queen, Suzu had grown considerably larger too, still not near the size of an elephant, but with all the food she was fed to keep her fattening up, she was making quicker progress than Simba had.  Another reason, of course was the child she was bearing.  It increased her appetite considerably and gave her strange cravings.  She desired quite bloody meat, devouring so much it stained her fur red.  As she once was, she'd have been terrified by the monster she seemed to become, but she had learned fast under Simba and became just as devilish as him.  They feared her as much as they did Simba and word quickly spread how they feared just what kind of beast their child would be once it was finally born.</span></div></div>",

With his increased girth, getting himself back home was going to be a lot more difficult than it was bringing him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may take some time to prepare a proper mode of transportation,\" explained Scar. \"Until then, just relax and feast while I have the hyenas prepare something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time was right as the hyenas weren't the most skilled craftsmen. Their early designs broke before Simba even got to try them out and later models broke under his weight. One model almost seemed to work, but after a lunch break, his weight increased and it smashed under his weight. This of course forced the hyenas to carry their mammoth king back home themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks of trial and error, however, they did manage to make something that did work and finally brought Simba out of the Jungle and into the Savanna. It didn't look like it had changed at all, but Simba sure had. He was the fattest lion he had ever seen. His stomach lifted him off the ground and made his legs as meaty as any hippos. If you asked any of the hyenas, his rear was truly a terror. They had many misfortunes of getting sat on when he was displeased and Simba took every opportunity to make them suffer as it was part of his new evil demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Simba changed in more than just weight and mind. He had gotten older and matured a bit in his time away. His body grew larger, though not catching up to his weight.  He also gained a tuft of brownish red hair on his head, showing the earlier signs of a mane coming in. His roar had also developed, making him sound even more terrifying when he was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he made it to the edge of the Pridelands, he had to make the rest of the trip himself. It wouldn't look good to show up with hyenas, let alone, in a chariot pulled by them. Lugging his weight was a chore that he wasn't planning on getting used to. When he made it to Pride Rock, he happened to run into Nala who had also developed a lot since he left. When she saw him, she just stared at him in awe and disbelief. Simba had come at that age and Scar did give that talk (and you can imagine what that was like), but he knew such things would be better for later. For now, he had to act like his old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba, I can't believe my eyes. You're alive and... huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good to see you too!\" Simba said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but when you just vanished for so long, we all thought you were dead. But by the way, you look like you've been flourishing!\" Nala said to Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm not such a bad hunter then after all,\" lied Simba, figuring that may be the best way to cover himself for now.  \"Is my father home? I want to surprise him. Also, there's something I need to address to the Pridelands. It's very important. Can you call a meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all so sudden,\" she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" said Simba in a dark tone that Scar often used on them when they were young. He stared into her eyes making her speechless. She just nodded and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be easier than I thought,\" smirked Simba, making his way up Pride Rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorkd quickly spread as Simba made his way to his father. The animals were also starting to arrive at Pride Rock, interested to see what he had to say. At the summit was Simba's parents just as surprised as Nala had been when she saw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba,\" began his father, almost in tears of seeing his son alive.  Simba didn't seem as emotional at this reunion, his corrupted nature hidden just below the surface. As the crowd was almost ready to hear what he had to say, he had to decide if he should speak with his parents first or greet the Pridelands first.</span></div></div>",

With that thought firmly planted in his head he curled up and began to cry uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his runt of a nephew soundly defeated, Scar signaled the hyenas to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're going to give up so easily?\" asked Scar, feigning concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never want to go through that again,\" cried Simba.  \"I just can't be a true king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, not all of us can command respect,\" he said twisting his words to make them lower Simba's self-esteem even further.  \"Some of us are just doomed to be given tasks we have no hope of completing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way?\" begged Simba.  \"I can't do this.  I can never be king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there may be a way,\" began Scar, making sure Simba was going to do it no matter what the order was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were to vanish from the Pridelands and never return they can never make you be a king,\" he said logically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true, but then who would be king?\" asked Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need not worry about such things,\" replied Scar.  \"Just know that it is of none of your concern from this day forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where can I go?\" asked Simba.  \"I don't want to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place can be your knew home.  As for company, the hyenas will always be around to make sure you have food to eat.  You would not even need to give them a single order.  I will do that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th- thanks, Scar,\" Simba said, his tears drying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only do it for your best interest,\" lied Scar.  \"Now I should head to the Pridelands and report that you have met a horrible end and will not be able to become king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scar left he nodded to the hyenas who started to give the occasional chuckle every few minutes.  Upon hearing that dreadful noise Simba started to become upset again.  Without Scar there to give him comfort Simba did the only other thing he could think of; he returned to the food before him and scarfed down huge chunks of it hoping the food would make the pain in his heart stop.  But just as he felt too sick to eat any more food he heard another horrid laugh and ate more with abandonment.</span></div></div>",

He probably wouldn't have stopped if the hyenas got bored and Scar had left for the Pride Lands.  As they stopped Simba felt the fullness hit him with full force and he collapsed on his large gut unable to move a muscle.  He was too depressed to move anyway.  He didn't feel he deserved it.  He ended up sleeping there throughout the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning he felt relatively better as he stood up.  His belly hung down more than before after digesting his meal.  Looking around he had eaten three Zebras while he was out of it.  It was a thought that made him sick at first, but then he recalled that he was tasked with eating all the food and despite the way it happened he had made a remarkable dent.  Simba didn't like that he couldn't order the hyenas around, but still, they had managed to get him to eat more and that alone gave him a small light of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyenas!\" he called.  Almost immediately they entered and looked at him.  \"Feed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they just burst into laughter again; the bad memories of last night still fresh in his mind.  He quickly became saddened and dove back into the food finding the room to fit it in his stomach.  He was devouring another Zebra again and was actually noticing how quickly he was finishing it off before moving on to another.  The hyenas quickly grew tired of laughing and retreated.  Simba tried to remain focused on eating and that sad feeling he had and managed to just fall short of finishing the zebra.  He considered having the hyenas return to help him, but he saw how uninteresting it was for them so they wouldn't stay long.  He knew he'd have to keep their interest, but that meant further humiliation.  Simba didn't like it, but it helped him.  On the other hand he could focus on eating it on his own.  He was already able to eat a lot more than he used to and if he kept it up he'd finish it in a lot less time than he thought possible.</span></div></div>",

It felt like he was going kill himself inside if he did it, but he doubted he had anything to lose at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sucked in his gut to look thinner. \"I want you to feed me,\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scar isn't here anymore,\" One said dully.  \"He's already begun his campaign to take over the Pride Lands!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Added another. \"He doesn't care about you anymore.  You're worthless to him!\"<br>\r\n\"The only reason we're even still around is because Scar thinks you might have some value as a bargaining chip if he needs one, but who would want you now?  Not your parents, not Scar, and definitely not us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Admitted Simba. \"Just look at me,\" He said as he was letting his stomach drop, causing it to bounce and his fat to jiggle. The hyenas were suprised by the site they just saw. \"And look at my rear,\" He turned for them to take a gander. \"I'm so fat, that throne isn't big enough for the two of us!\" The hyenas were starting to crack smiles, finding his little display a lot more amusing than his mournful stuffing. \"And all his eating is very habit forming,\"  He pulled out a chunk of zebra meat from his stomach. \"I keep a few chunks in my folds for eating on the go, but I'm too fat to go anywhere!\"  This joke got the chuckling, but what they saw next topped even that. Simba sat on his fat rear and hefted his stomach up and shook it. The doughy gut jiggled and danced and jumped in such a ridiculous manner. An eye full of this was enough to have them on the ground cackling as loud as they ever did and they couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba went to the food to resume his sorrowful binge, but something was different.

It had been so long since he was there that it felt like it was a dream. Simba also realized that his recent binging had made his movement a lot more sluggish, but it made sense since he was still a cub and probably weighed more than the average adult lion. If he didn't return home soon, he'd eventually get too big to return without losing the weight and deep down, Simba had come to enjoy his obesity and even desired to increase it. Still, he didn't want to continue unless he was in a place that he'd be happy to stay. He knew the hyenas here were a lot friendlier than he first gave them credit for, but it didn't change the fact that he wanted to go home. He figured he could at least talk with them to see if they would return with him. Scar had left them with him and surely they wouldn't have any other reason to stay if he left. Simba was even confident that they would help in preventing Scar's attack on the Pridelands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his confidence not diminishing, Simba waddled over to the hyenas. They were already chuckling, seeing him return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got some more material for us kid?\" laughed one of the hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he wants to make his belly talk again,\" replied another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think the one where he belly flops is the funniest,\" stated the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No comedy this time, fellas,\" said Simba. \"I want to go home and I was wondering if you wanted to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyenas stopped laughing. This was something they had never considered. True, they had been loyal to Scar, but they had never expected the lion cub to grow on them as he did. It also crossed their mind that the Pridelands had never been to kind to them and once Scar was in charge, they wouldn't be the outcasts anymore, but they might be welcomed as heroes if they brought Simba back safely, despite being so large and fat now. They huddled together and discussed it before the leader returned to tell Simba their answer. The lead hyena answered for them all.</span></div></div>",

He was in that temple so long he couldn't recall the path he took to get here and everything even looked different. Simba eventually found lion tracks and knew the only one they could belong to was Scar. He followed them as best he could into the thick foliage, but before long, he ran out of paw prints to track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path was also becoming a lot trickier and he was forced to take detours when his girth made going anywhere else impossible. At times, Simba had to back track when he reached a dead end. The more this happened, the more he became lost. He couldn't even find his way back to the temple and to make matters worse, his sedate and food-filled lifestyle made him weak and quick to tire out. His rumbling stomach quickly became unbearable and in no time at all, he collapsed on the ground. As the great circle in the sky started to set, Simba was filled with dread. Such an obese animal alone and helpless would make any predator's day. He had to pray that nothing would come across his way unless they would offer him something to eat.

He expected some giant and fierce-looking creatures hungry for his meaty haunches and that made his heart pound. When they jumped out, he saw these terrifying creatures that danced around on two legs and had bright colorful faces with large eyes to fit in their equally large heads. If Simba had been calmer, he'd have realized they were wearing masks, but he was so scared he jumped to his feet and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments ago, Simba didn't think he could even run and now he was scampering through the jungle, his belly bouncing crazily as he moved. As expected, the creatures chased him. As fast as Simba was moving, they were faster. They didn't run faster than a lion, but he wasn't in the best shape anymore and he was quickly boxed in. They tossed ropes around him and pinned him to the ground. They then used the ropes to tie him up and drag him to their village. He was placed in a cage and left to wait there until morning. Simba was scared, but he was so tired he quickly fell asleep and hoped he'd awaken to find this was just a bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his eyes opened, he found he was still behind bars and the whole tribe of creatures were now looking at him from the largest of adults to the youngest children. What they said made no sense to him, but they seemed quite interested in him, particularly over his unusual size. After a while, Simba's stomach growled and it seemed this was the first thing to make them grow quiet. At once, they scattered about and brought to Simba an assortment of meats that they dropped into his cage. Simba was a bit skeptical at first over what they were up to, but hunger got the better of him and he started eating. The meats were brought to him differently, but the tastes were the same. It was then Simba noticed a statue place in the center of their village. He easily recognized it as a lion and a large one at that. It seemed very important to them and quickly Simba had ideas of what they had planned for him.</span></div></div>",

Not only did they see a lion as a creature of strength and power, but life and growth as well. In their eyes, a lion, and a full and meaty one was a sign of good tidings ahead. One could imagine the delight they had in finding Simba so big and round wandering into their territory. The warriors who found him brought him back to their village and announced their find as Simba slept. The elders of the village deemed this find was in fact their Diety, Simbasa, descending from the heavens to better observe those most devoted to him. They agreed that he came in the form of a cub to be raised and cared for by them. Depending on their efforts would result in either their tribe being blessed or or cursed. Not taking any chances, they prepared the finest meats they could find and were prepared to pamper him to ensure his happiness never wavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Simba got done staring at the lion statue he returned to his meat, his recent binges at the temple causing him to develop an exceptionally large appetite for a lion his age but at the same time it convinced the tribe that he was a deity with an unearthly appetite. With no trouble at all he ate all the food they brought him and they didn't stop until he gave any sign that he was content with the meal, usually a belch or a yawn before he stretched and rested on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the villagers would do everything in their power to appease him. The younger ones would take turns petting and rubbing his body to help relax him while the women would brush and groom him, cleaning his hair and taking care of him from head to toe, even taking care of his claws and teeth with no fear that he might lash out at them. They also made sure he had a soft place to rest and digest while the men went out to hunt for more meat for him at the next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Simba was very wary of what their intention was, but it was short lived due to two facts. The first was that he was now hopelessly lost from the Pridelands now that he was taken from the path he was on and now was so turned around that he didn't even have a general idea of where to go. The other was, all the pampering and care-taking that he had been given from first the hyenas and now these strange creatures had become so familiar to him it was almost like an addiction. His self reliance was diminished with his weight slowing him down and his muscles softening. Simba no longer had the drive he did in the days before to hunt; it was far more appealing to simply let these creatures feed and care for him. It was hardly a thing he needed to consider as he practically submitted to this lifestyle after only a few feedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his body already adapted to digesting his meals into fat on his body, Simba fattened up quickly to the villages efforts. His stomach was touching the ground even as he stood and fat clung over every inch of him. His face was so chubby that the way his mouth looked it almost seemed like he was smiling happily convincing the tribe they were really pleasing their god and encouraging them to pamper and feed him more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that beat the feedings was the worshiping. Simba didn't know what they were saying, but he understood enough that they were paying him their respects. He didn't think they saw him as highly as a god, but he did think that he was like a king to them and why should he disappoint them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba grew larger by the days and before long, he was truly worth his size as a deity. He was mostly a round blob with legs that didn't come close to the ground. He couldn't eat food on the ground as it was too for for his head to reach past his chest. It was still a point as the villagers made sure to hand feed him. They showed no fear of him biting them. His mood had become as sweet and loving as a lion could and it comforted them that they had pleased their great, big God. At the same time, the village seemed to be thriving more that it had when Simba first arrived.  They had good rains and their crops grew in nice and healthy. All their hunting proved very successful, allowing for ample food for Simba and themselves. Simba knew he didn't lift a finger to help; he couldn't budge an inch after all, but things seemed to work out for everything by pure chance, and that was enough for them to continually increase his food portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother unique thing that occurred during his time there was even more amazing. The words that Simba could only identify as mumbles from the villagers started to make sense. He didn't know if it was because he was hearing it so much or if he was connecting more with these strange creatures while he was isolated from other animals. Either way, the more he listened, the clearer it translated until he could hear their words like they spoke the same language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Simba, it was a lot better understanding their words as he was able to smile and know how great they thought he was. It made him happy and almost believe he was a God if he didn't truly at times. Understanding them was enough to make him think that. At first, he only seemed to understand them while they praised him. But soon after, any word he caught was clear as another lion's roar. The villagers had no idea of this change in him and conversed near him, unaware of him ease-dropping. Thanks to this, he was able to learn the names of each villager and a little information about them. Smelling their scent was also the one way he was able to identify them, but he could identify differences in appearance and voices. It was a totally different experience for him, though instead of becoming more like a God, he was really becoming more human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis curiosity into this matter grew.  At night, he practiced trying to learn to speak like them. It was easily the hardest thing he had ever tried to do. Like fitting a cube into a round hole, he had to force it before he made any progress. The growls became mumbles and then rasps, but finally, words passed his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can talk like them,\" he whispered excitedly. He was so excited at learning this, but he had to decide just who he was going to share this gift with.</span></div></div>",

That wasn't the only change for Simba, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew older, and nearly reached maturity, he had become less and less motivated to run, swim, or really do anything but sleep, eat, and lay around. His body was showing the effects of this change as well. His belly hung more than a foot down past his chest, and his midsection had swollen out around six inches past its usual size. His neck was thicker, showing the beginning (and middle) of a double-chin, and his legs were definitely more fleshy than muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, he welcomed this change. In Simba's mind, the less he looked like a king, the less he'd ever have to be king. Why go back to the pridelands when he had two best friends, a lavish jungle, and enough bugs to feed ten lions for life?

His legs were thicker than some of the trees around him, and the lion's mane was starting to be overshadowed by his double, almost triple, chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon and Pumbaa had noticed his change, and asked him if he was feeling OK. \"Better than ever, not a care in the world!\" came Simba's reply. \"I'm honestly as happy as I could ever be. Thank you two so much for all you've done. Come on, let's pig out!\" The meerkat and warthog were a bit worried, but figured if he was happy, why stop him?

Simba had quickly lost track of his time with Timon and Pumba and each day he just seemed to wake up larger than the last till he became so big his stomach touched the ground when he was on all four paws.  Normally, becoming that big would scare of at least shock anyone, but Simba didn't seem to register anything but hakuna matada these days and simply smiled as he awoke Timon and Pumbaa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both decided to join in with Simba on indulging to their hearts' content and gained almost as fast as Simba.  Timon's gut was so big not it sloshed whenever he moved, preventing him from moving by himself.  If he needed to go anywhere he needed to ride on either Pumbaa or Simba.  Pumbaa gained quite a bit as well, filling out similarly to Simba, though Simba had put this so-called pig to shame, often outeating him whenever they ate.  He was also beginning to lose his immobility as he gut barely allowed his feet to touch the ground.  Simba was only able to stay mobile for so long due to the fact he had still been growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got up they followed Simba to their current feeding logs.  One thing they discovered in the first month of their endless binge fests was that you can't feast without food.  They cleaned out entire logs in a single sitting and ended up waking up some days to find their logs bare of their normal bounty of bugs.  They learned from this and figured out how to provent this from happening.  They toppled over some more trees to attract more juicy bugs for them to eat.  They also planned a feeding schedule they would follow so they would know which logs they would go to each day for their fill and by the time they reset back to the first log it would be a smorgesborg once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard work to set up, but paid off big time by indication of their ever expanding waistlines.

And they reached the log just in time since Simba was sweating and breathing heavily as his underbelly was sore from being dragged across the ground. With a content sight, Simba drops down and lies on his belly, making it spill out to all sides of him, which makes it hard to reach the bugs. But somehow, he still manages. Next to him, Timon is walking slowly towards his part of the log as his belly sways from side to side. It will make him fall if he moves too fast. Pumbaa was not the fittest but most mobile of them as he was better suited to carry weight more than lions and meercats, but also he found moving to be rather harder.<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes, the log is cleansed and they are lying in the sun feeling their stuffed bodies. The heat makes them all want a swim in the lake and Pumbaa picks up Timon and goes to tell Simba to get moving. Simba, drowsy and stuffed, just tells them to go ahead. Normally, they would have waited, but today was especially hot.<br>\r\nSimba noticed the heat well under both his fur and his enormous bulk. He feels like he is melting and the cool water in the lake is becoming more and more tempting. At last, he can't stand the heat anymore. Stuffed or not, he needs to cool off. He begins to gather his legs so he can push himself up. Once his flabby legs are in place, he begins to push himself up, something he did without thinking before. But now, it's a pain. He is stuffed from all the bugs and his belly is becoming so big, he only gets halfway up before falling down panting wildly. At first, he is shocked, but he remembers hakuna matata and relaxes. He kept on thinking that things will work out and it's probably the heat draining him.<br>\r\nHe rests for half an hour before trying again. This time, he gets up a little less before his stamina wears out and he collapses into a panting, yellow mass of fat. Giving up on getting up for now, Simba rolls over to his side and falls asleep, his belly rising like a mountain above him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Simba, Timon and Pumbaa made their way to the first log at the outskirts of the jungle, they saw something that was lying on it. Something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a full-grown lioness whose colors on the fur seemed familiar to Simba. She was laying over the log unconscious. Of the skinniness of her body it looked like she hadn\u2019t been eating for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba rushed (To both his friends and himself surprise given the state of his body.) towards the weaken lioness. He was just ten feet away from the log when he had seen the lioness, but it felt as exhausting for Simba like running seven miles. For every step he took his hundreds of pounds belly would slam into the ground and get in the way of his turkey stuffed legs. His breath became very deep very quickly, too. He felt so warm and painful in his muscles that he thought that he would collapse before reaching the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Simba didn't know who the lioness was, he ran towards her like she was someone he would want to protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity (but actually was about a minute), Simba reached the lioness on the log. While still breathing heavily because of the running, Simba took one paw and lifted up the lionesses' head so he could see her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can't be right!\u201d Simba thought when he saw the face of the lioness. But before he could do anything else, the lioness woke up by the sound of his breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Simba?\u201d The lioness said in a weak voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNala,\u201d Simba replied. Even though she could only see his face, Nala didn\u2019t belive it was Simba first. His face was so rounded and fat looking like his neck had been pulled down into his body. But she thought that it was probably due to the sun and the fact that she hadn't been eaten for so long that had made her vision look so strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on her way to say something more when she lost consciousness again. Simba knew that she needed to be in the shadows and get some water and food. He took and laid her on his back and made his way back to he and his friend\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was carrying a 200-pound lioness on his back, Simba's determination to give her help gave him strength to walk back like she was nothing. His walk cycle back into the jungle made him almost look like he wasn't morbidly obese. He took great powerful steps, kept his stomach in place so it wasn't swaying around with every step he took, and he even had control over his breathing pace so he didn't get short on breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way back, he saw that Timon and Pumbaa had tried to follow him, but given that their body's were even fatter in comparison to Simba's, they had only managed to get halfway the distance before giving up. Timon is so all around fat that he can't even walk. And Pumbaa can barely walk with his bloated belly. So when going somewhere, Pumbaa had to carry the very overweight Timon with him on his back. And this time, doing it in a hurry to catch up to Simba proved too much for them. Seeing Simba, Timon said breathless, \u201cWe w-where about to get to you Simba!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's nice of you guys,\u201d Simba said. \u201cBut I've got this fixed and we have to get back home now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon and Pumbaa sighed a bit, knowing that after they finally had caught up to Simba after only getting halfway now, had to head back the same way again.</span></div></div>",

Being that they were so small in size and the weak state of Nala meant that they were going to have to feed her huge masses of bugs. The only downside is that bugs have a weird effect on lions, as Simba was a living example on being very filling with fat if they are consumed in large doses with little or no moving activity to it. This means that giving Nala them would help her get better and they are easy to get to her, but giving that she would probably not have the energy to move for some days would make her very fat. Not as fat as Simba, but still, not normal for a lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other alternative is for Simba to go out and hunt after some prey for Nala. Being that he, Timon and Pumbaa hadn't been eating anything else but bugs since Simba's arrival, the jungle now had it's fair share of zebras, antelopes, gazelles, and other favorite foods for lions. The problem here was that it was usually female lions that did the hunting, while the males job was to protect the pack from other males wanting to take the position as leader. To make things worse, Simba wasn't in his best shape. He had previously had a hard time running to an unconscious Nala on a log before. How hard wouldn't it be for Simba to sneak up and to catch up to prey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way of getting food should he choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba knew that what Nala really needed to eat was the same thing that he himself would have dined on: Meat. Meat from zebra, gazelle and/or antelope. Even though males didn\u2019t usually hunt and he himself was nowhere near fit for hunting, he knew that if he didn't try to do anything now, she would die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he ordered Timon and Pumbaa to look after Nala while he went out searching for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simba tried to get used to walking a longer distance, he knew that he also needed a strategy if he was going to capture something. A \u201creal\u201d lion wouldn\u2019t have any problems running up to a prey and kill it, but since Simba could hardly walk normally, he knew he must try to surprise his prey or he wouldn't succeed. As he walked (or actually waddled) deeper into the jungle, he saw a zebra. And not only that, but it was a very fat zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems the lazy jungle life didn\u2019t only change me and my friends,\u201d Simba thought. But even though the zebra was big in size, it still looked like it could run off without problems, which was more than you could say about the so called \u201cking of the jungle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba first felt like he was about to give up on the whole thing. When his mind tells him that a big bellied, lonely zebra would be too hard for him to catch, then he wouldn't be able to hunt anything. But then, he remembered the weak and hungry Nala and how he was her only hope of saving her from starvation. So he got his thoughts together and started to search the area for a way to make an easy kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra was in a small clearing area with many trees surrounding it. There were still some openings, meaning that if Simba tried to block one entrance, the zebra would still escape through another. He also saw that it wasn't only trees surrounding the area. There was a small cliff (about 10 feet's tall) that was also shielding the area. Simba saw that the zebra was eating grass near the bottom of the cliff, giving Simba an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, Simba took and tried to sneakily climb up the cliff from behind. This plan he had wasn't very thought-out. It actually sounded very stupid when thinking about it too much. His plan was to jump down from the cliff right on top of the zebra and slice it with his claws and teeth. Climbing up this small cliff turned out to be one of the hardest and most exhausting things that he ever put his body through. He could barley reach up his front paws to grab the ground above because his arms were so heavy with fat and so low on muscles that they almost did not obey him. His hind legs had trouble, too. It was almost impossible for them to step forward and help push his body up to the top of the cliff because his big hanging belly got in the way of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally reaching the top, Simba took a minute to catch his breath before looking over the edge to see if the zebra was still there. Luckily for him it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d Simba thought. \u201cNow or never!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Simba leaped off. During the fall, Simba discovered that the air resistance made his arms and legs go out to it sides, pining him in an awkward falling position. As he was falling down towards the zebra, the zebra didn't notice anything at first. But then, it saw a big shadow form itself around it. It reached it's head up and saw a big fleshy belly of a lion before it all turned dark for the zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's fall ended with him falling belly first on top of the zebra, crushing the zebra's neck and back with his added weight. He had been afraid of getting hurt by the fall, but to his surprise, the zebra had slowed down his fall speed enough for him to be unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the zebra corpse, he couldn't believe it at first. He had somehow with his useless body and poorly thought out plan actually managed to kill prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had made a successful hunt.</span></div></div>",

Just the sheer smell of meat and blood seemed to give Nala back a bit of her strength, giving that she managed to stand up and with staggering steps making it to the carcase. Just to take in smell again just to make sure it was real, and then she dived in and ate like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been such a long time since she had had a proper meal that she didn\u2019t even thought about that the humongous lion that had been giving her the zebra actually was Simba. She was right now almost a skeleton of a lioness and just needed food to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Nala eat made Simba both happy and sad. He was happy that he could be to such big help for his childhood friend how was almost at the verge of death when he found her. That was also the thing that made him both sad and furious. How someone could have been treating her so bad and then just leave her like this. He couldn\u2019t wait for her to be finish with her meal so she could tell him what had happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last swallow Nala had completely eaten the zebra. All that was left was skeleton with barley anything one it. Nala\u2019s stomach was now all round and sphere and full. She laid herself down on her back, resting her body of this enormous meal that she had now had. Even though she was feeling a bit of pain in her belly of all the food she had eaten, her face showed that she was feeling more warmth and alive now. Her eyes were also much more energetic now scanning her area that she currently was in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she saw trees and bushes and birds and rivers and frankly wondered \u201cwhere were she now?\u201d The last thing she remembered was that she was wandering in the desert running from the terror that was ruling the kingdom, and being so weak that she had collapsed and was about to become a feast for the vultures. The very last thing she saw before closing her eyes where this really weird creature that had come to save her. It looked at first glance like a lion, but it was so fat. Its legs all looked wider then her own waist, even back when she had a healthy looking body. And it had the biggest belly of every creature that she had ever seen. It looked like there was enough room inside there to have her whole inside it. The thing that hit her thinking about it was the creatures face. It looked so familiar, and it looked back at her giving her the same reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala had just thought that when see turned her head to see a meerkat that was so fat that he didn\u2019t seem to be able too move anywhere on his own. Next to him she saw an enormous warthog that was so looked so obese and juicy that it looked like something out of a food dream she ones had. The sight actually made her saliva drop from her mouth a little scaring the pig to step back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned her head too look right at a big, round, yellow, furry, stomach. She knew immediately that this was the same creature that had saved her live out in the desert. She raised her head to see that standing tall was, just as she had guessed but not believing at first was indeed her old childhood friend and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Simba?\u201d she asked all confused and shocked. Simba couldn\u2019t help but smile at just how over the top chocked Nala\u2019s face where. She literary had her mouth just hanging down open because of this. \u201cHello Nala, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Simba replied quite normal just to tease a bit with Nala. \u201cB-But how? H-How are you so so\u2026\u201d Nala asked almost speechless to Simba before getting stuck on the last word. \u201cFat?\u201d Simba simply finished her sentence. Nala only gave a slightly nod, still keeping constant eye contact to him, not even doing as much as a blink. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d Simba said while throwing his mane back still acting like everything was normal. \u201cIt all started with me tasting one little bug. It was a\u2026 Prionidae, I think. Was it that guys?\u201d Simba asked Timon and Pumbaa. \u201cYes definitely.\u201d Timon answered quickly. \u201cI think so.\u201d Pumbaa said. \u201cI was unsure about eating it at first, but it had a great taste and was surprisingly satisfying.\u201d Simba continued while waddling around the place giving Nala a great look at how his body was working while moving, seeing Nala taking in every single detail of it. \u201cThey became very addictive, and before I knew it I had been eating enough of them to give me a body like this.\u201d Simba said and gave his belly a nice slap shaking it widely. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I got so fat.\u201d Simba said to Nala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this Nala had been able to take in the picture of that the lion male that she had had as play friend as a cub, had now become something that probably weight three times as much as a normal full grown male would weight. She had also bought Simba\u2019s story of how he had become so big (Seeing that by doing nothing else but eating during all those years that Simba had been missing could be possible.). But one thing she still hasn\u2019t been able to understand. Why? Why had he done this to himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut can you tell me why did you become so\u2026 rounded?\u201d Nala asked still not wanting to call him the obvious. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d Simba tried to say something to answer, but he couldn\u2019t. He had just as Nala had a hard time to take in the situation. While Nala\u2019s problem had been that of Simba\u2019s weight, his had been about the great guilt of being responsible for his fathers death. And he really didn\u2019t want to let Nala know about it. He had also since talking to her started to feel something for her, and he could see that she felt the same and that she seemed really temped to \u201cfeel\u201d his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that in mind Simba continued where he left of\u2026 \u201cWell, I would really like to tell you\u2026\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d Nala answered curiously. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t be nice if I showed you some more of this place first?\u201d Simba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNala thinking after for a moment finally said\u2026</span></div></div>",

However, one evening he is troubled by an odd pain in his shoulder. Despite Nala's assurances that the ache will probably be gone by the morning, the King ventures to Rafiki's baobab to see if he can help him relieve the pain. But, once he climbs up, he finds the tree deserted. With his shoulder already starting to feel better, Simba decides that it would be best to head back, but he catches his paw on one of Rafiki's trinkets. Unable to stop himself, the lion falls over, with his open muzzle landing in a bowl of a strange, red goo.

I think I'll go back tomorrow to see if he's there. Anyway, do you know when dinner is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just sent out the pride to get something good,\" She smiled lovingly, \"And I also had an urge to have them pick up something extra special for you, since you've always been <i>sooo</i> skinny all the time,\" she laughed as she began to play with him, rolling around, licking him, and, since no other lion or lioness was around, finally had the adult fun they both have been wanting for awhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba and Nala nuzzled each other with a new love they hadn't had in a long time, ever since they found each other in the jungle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... that was <b>great</b> honey,\" Nala purred with a smile. Simba smiled, when his stomach growled loudly with hunger, which was unusual for him. He never seemed to get more than the least bit starving since there was always food around in the den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pride must be getting <i>a lot</i> of food,\" Simba noted with pleasure. \"I'm getting unusually very hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que, the pride suddenly came back with more meat than they usually did. Zebras, gazelles, and even a hippo. Since all of the lions and lionesses simply adored their King and Queen for saving them from the wrath of Zulu, they willingly gave the extra food meant for Simba to him, bowing their heads in respect as they left to start their evening meal. Simba looked at his pride, who were waiting for him to begin eating, then back to his wife, who looked at him mischievously. Simba smiled and began digging into his food as if he was starving. The pride and his wife then began to eat their food with him, as Simba marveled at how amazing the food tasted today. <i>It must have been that red goo I accidentally swallowed....maybe that's why I'm so hungry...</i> Simba smiled. Whatever the reason, he really liked this new hunger of his, and apparently so did Nala....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the pride had fallen asleep for the night, Simba was still chowing down on his food. His stomach had grown quite a few inches and he loved it, only wanting to grow bigger and bigger just for Nala's love. Once he started his fat hippo, he suddenly felt someone begin to rub his slightly bulging stomach. He looked down, slightly annoyed since it disturbed him eating and found out it was Nala, who laughed at him playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nala!\" he whispered in a loving tone. \"I'm still eating and still <i>really</i> hungry, but there's not much food left. Do you think you could bring back kind of a lot of food?\" Nala stopped laughing and looked concerned, even though she more than willing to get him more food at any time of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling OK? Was there something you ate at Rafiki's tree--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba exhaled softly, still trying to eat. \"Yes. I accidentally ate some red goo stuff, and I think that's what's making me so hungry all the time. And hey, I'll make up for it later tonight,\" He said this quickly but with a small smile on his face, showing Nala that he liked all of his hunger and that he was excited about their new, passionate love. She smiled, and quickly left after hearing this, determined to bring back something big again for Simba to satisfy his hunger.</span></div></div>",

Mufasa's fur was a lighter shade. He of course lacked the scar for which Scar was known. Neither of these things Scar could change. Mufasa's size however contrasted his. Scar realized that his brother was larger than him. More muscle and fat donned his bones. Perhaps if Scar were to gain weight he could be respected more...</span></div></div>",

It has been about a year since Gru has had his children and he and the kids loved every moment of it. They always hung out with each other, loved each other, and most importantly, they felt like a next to normal family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid haven't changed much, but they have changed in some ways. They have all grown a little bit bigger, but not in a bad way. They were getting older, but they were all still pretty young. Margo was the smart one out of the kids because of the fact she was older. Agnes was still very hyper, but happy. And then there was Edith. She was the most different out of the siblings. Edith was most like Gru, thinking darker and more evil thoughts. She actually wanted to take over the family business someday if she could. Gru could kind of see this in her, which made him excited in some ways. Edith had changed most of all out of the kids. She still wore her same clothes, but her hat now had black stripes like her jacket. She was becoming more darker, she even quit ballet and started to do her own thing unlike her sisters. But no one minded this. Not even Gru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith opened her eyes as she looked around her room from her bed. She now had her own room with many of her own things. Her room has mostly black items and clothing. Edith raised herself out of her bed, rubbing her eyes, yawning, and straightening out her hat. She then proceeded to get out of bed and changed into her daily clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked out to her kitchen to see if anyone was home. She looked around and saw a note on the counter, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith,<br>\r\nI went to go drop off Margo and Agnes at dance. I should be back soon. I got a suprise for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove,<br>\r\nGru<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith smiled, starting to think of what she could do before Gru got home. She was even curious to the suprise that Gru had for her. After thinking for a little bit, Edith....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt a craving for something sweet, but filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Edith got out the skillet and started to make pancakes, bacon, and some sausage. Edith usually made herself food, but this time, she didn't remove the grease from the skillet. Honestly, she had forgotten to do so. Edith even became creative and added chocolate chips into her pancakes. She started to lick her lips after smelling the delicious food. Here and there, Edith laughed as a minion or two walked by, smelling the breakfast. They would immediately become hyper and start to bounce off the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter minutes of waiting, Edith took the food off the skillet and placed it on a plate. She sat down and lathered her food in syrup and powdered sugar. She started to stuff herself with the food, trying to satisfy her awkward hunger. She devoured her pancakes and started eating her strips of bacon. Edith then remembered the note. She was wondering what Gru meant by the fact that he had a surprise for her. She was really curious to find out what it was. Edith kept on eating her food until at one point, she noticed her plate was empty. She was full at this point, but smiling from the great taste of the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith looked down and noticed that she had developed a small belly from the meal. It looked like a bump since she was wearing her black sweatshirt. She began to poke it and smiled at the complexion of it. Somehow, she sort of liked it. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Hmmm... it could take a while before I'm done looking through that place. It's pretty big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith decided to look around anyway. She didn't had anything else to do. She also knew there was a chance she would once have all this. If she wanted to take over the family business, she needed to learn from the best and (in her eyes) Gru was the best. All MINIONS happily waved at her while she walked through the lab. She finally stopped by a table with a few cups on it and some bottles with strange liquids and a lot of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if I need to look for my surprise in here, I will be busy for the next 10 years. I'm thirsty too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a cup from the table thinking it was just a cup with something normal to drink. She took one sip and smacked her lips. It tasted good and kind of sweet, but also a bit exotic. She wondered what it was. Some kind of lemonade maybe? She drank the entire cup empty in one gulp and belched. Edith never really cared so much about manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tasted good. Well If that surprise is in here, I'm never gonna find it. I wonder how Agnes and Margo are doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she walked back upstairs. There was also a big chance Gru had the surprise with him. Or maybe he still needed to buy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith just walked a bit through the house not really doing anything. She was just waiting for Gru to come back. She looked out of the window seeing of she could see his car.<br>\r\nShe then heard something strange that sounded like it was bubbling. She noticed it came from inside her.

She grabbed her stomach and started to moan at the anguish of hunger. Edith knew that she had to eat something and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Edith headed to the kitchen, looked inside of the refrigerator, and grabbed as many delicious looking items as she could. Edith saw a cake, some left over steak from the other night, and even some donuts. She grabbed them all and started to shove the huge portions into her mouth. She started with the cake. Edith noticed that the cake was covered in a chocolate frosted layer topped with oreo cookies. After she took the first bite, she was enticed to take more of the cake, trying to quench her hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the whole cake, Edith noticed that she was still hungry. She then decided to move on to the second item: the steak. She quickly warmed it up and brought it out of the microwave. After licking her lips in anguish, she started to destroy the meat into her chompers. The meat tasted so tender, it made Edith feel that much more satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after yet again realizing her hunger wasn't tamed, she looked at the donuts sitting in front of her. Without letting more time pass, Edith munched on the donuts until they were all devoured into her stomach. After eating the last donut, Edith clenched her stomach in satisfaction, not realizing how much she just ate or the stomach she was gaining.</span></div></div>",

However, she grew a bit and her hair was longer, but pretty much the same cute attitude. <br>\r\nAlso Margo was pretty much the same also, but a bit taller and she started wearing a back pack most of the time. Not only at school but most of the time she went somewhere else. It didn't really matter where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Edith. You missed a nice ballet lesson,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I don't care about ballet. At least not anymore. I've outgrown it,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Margo is even older than you and she still likes ballet. So that can't be it,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Edith! Did you eat all this?\" Margo asked and looked at all the stuff on the table. \"Did you get the munchies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith belched loudly and mumbled: \"Maybe. I just got really hungry all of a sudden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minions walked into the kitchen. The three girls got used to the little creatures. They liked them and often played with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's our Dad?\" Edith asked, wondering when she would get her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's getting something in the car,\" Margo said. \"Well I'm going upstairs. I still have to do some homework!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there some candy left?\" Agnes asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Agnes. No more sugar for you. You already had some today,\" Gru said while he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes sadly went sitting on a chair, but she knew Gru was right. She was very hyper by nature and eating something sweet filled with sugar only made her even more hyper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Margo?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upstairs doing her homework.\" Edith said. \"What's the surprise, Dad? You said you had one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. That's true. You're now at the same age I was when I got this. When I was a young criminal I already had some evil plans to do great things. So here's you own... criminal handbook for the young criminal!\" He said and handed her a brand new book. \"I especially ordered it for you. It has all kinds of tricks and ways to become a great criminal. It was a lot of use to me when I was your age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Cool! I will study it, Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her belly let out a growl. She smiled friendly at Gru, but Agnes looked surprised at her sister. Not so much surprised about the book.  Agnes just got a new unicorn doll not long ago and she liked that way more than a book about how to become a criminal. But how could her sister still be hungry after all she had eaten?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Dad... could I have something to eat first? I'm really hungry!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes also stayed at the kitchen table. She was also hungry after ballet. They had a fun lesson and Gru came to every performance since he saved them from Vector. Gru also got a lot of attention from all the mothers who were there since he was still single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, you two. Something to eat,\" And he handed each of them a plate with three sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm off to my lab. I have something important I need to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith happily started to devour her sandwich. Agnes took much smaller bites while she looked at Edith with a puzzled look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you still be hungry after all you ate?\" Agnes asked. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"I don't know. Puberty maybe,\" Edith said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're way too young for puberty. Even Margo isn't at puberty and she's the oldest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith finished her sandwiches and snatched the last sandwich from her sister's plate and wolfed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... that was mine!\" Agnes yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" Edith said and ran out the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Gru laughed at this, happy with his minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru headed over to his lab table to see what he was up to last. He looked at some of his blueprints from previous inventions, including his rocket ship he built a while back. He continued to look and remembered what he did last. He remembered that he was working on a chemical to enhance weight gain for his enemies like Vector. Eventually, he found the bottle of the chemical. The bad news was that the bottle was empty. Gru was shocked to see that, knowing that this chemical had not been tested that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who took the vile?\" Gru yelled out loud. All around him, the minions stopped what they were doing and looked at Gru. With all of them talking, Gru heard whispers and mumbling that made it hard to understand what any of them were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! You all need to stop. Look around for that vile!

I'm really, really hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo looked worried at her younger sibling and noticed she was fatter.

This time they didn't have to worry about leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could help Edith.

Her belly stuck out more than before. Her face was fuller and her thighs and butt had also a layer of fat on them just like her arms and legs.

I had no luck. It might need some more time than I thought,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Do you see how fast she's gaining? She going to have problems like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that.

You all three understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Dad,\" All three girls said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Dad, can I please have some food?

I don't think she hears you,\" Agnes tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she does hear me, but she acts like she can't. She also locked the door and I can't open it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edith could probably open it. If she was here,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nSuddenly, Gru appeared.

Next to her were four empty pizza boxes. Edith closed her jaws over the last slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate all the pizza and you didn't even think about leaving some for us!\" Margo said. She was really angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I was just really hungry,\" Edith said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about our sister promise? We would always share everything. This isn't sharing and look what that gluttony has done to your figure,\" Margo said and pushed a finger into Edith's flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes really was sure which side she needed to choose. She loved both her sisters.

Although she felt hungry, she knew that she had to stay home. As a matter of fact, she was starting to feel tired from all of the eating she just took part in. Edith moved the boxes under her bed and went under her covers, closing her eyes and drifting to sleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. At this point, she was in dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith was sitting in her bed, but she had some covers over her. She opened her eyes to look around herself. The first thing she saw surprised her. She was super obese! She was so big, she had to weight above eight-hundred pounds, which made her immobile. Her clothes had ripped long ago, which meant she was wearing no clothes but her hat. Her arms were as big as her pillows while her breasts were even bigger! She could feel the rolls underneath her neck. She was at the point that her chins blended in together. But the biggest feature that she had was by far her belly, which was coated in huge amounts of fat and ripples. She loved the feeling of all of her fat surrounding her, making her feel like a butterball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from the ceiling, a pipe came down and approached her face. She tried to move her head away from it, but she was too much out of energy to do so. Immediately, the pipe went into Edith's mouth. Within minutes, she could hear a liquid sound around her. Within seconds, a liquid started to come out through the pipe. Hesitating, Edith swallowed the liquid since it wasn't stopping. Surprisingly, it tasted very delicious. It was a mix of chocolate and caramel, which made her more willing to swallow the liquid. All she did was suck on the pipe, closing her eyes and savoring the taste of the liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time she opened her eyes was when the liquid had stopped coming out of the pipe. She wondered why it had stopped, but then she didn't care since she did feel full. She looked at her body and noticed that she had at least doubled in size! She let out a gasp of disbelief, amazed at her shear size. But before she could enjoy her size, she started to feel groggy and drifted back to sleep, loving her fat self. </span></div></div>",

She wasn't obese, but she was just her old self. However, she noticed her clothes felt kind of tight. She got up and looked in her mirror. She did gain weight. No question about that. It was obvious that she wasn't really fat, but without a doubt, she was chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be obese. Just like in my dream,\" Edith mumbled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out of the window. Gru's car wasn't there, meaning he probably still was away with Margo and Agnes.<br>\r\nShe knew she shouldn't have taken all the pizzas, but she was just so hungry, she couldn't control herself. It wasn't really like her. Sure, she always had some strange, mean side to her against other people except for her siblings, Gru, their new grandmother and the Minions. So why didn't she think about her siblings? Suddenly, her belly rumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm hungry again? But I just ate. But... there's no food in the house. Now I need to wait until they're back,\" Edith said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to remember her dream. She remembered she was so obese, she could hardly move. She wanted to feel that again. She wanted more than to feel it again. She wanted it to be real. She wanted to become so fat, she became immobile. To become that, she needed to eat and with her new hunger, that wouldn't be much of a problem. But then there needed to be food, of course, and that was something that wasn't there. She ate every piece of food in the house yesterday. She even ate the dog food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my tummy wants food,\" She cried while she held her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tummy rumbled again, but there was no food in the house. She had no choice but to wait. She decided to go downstairs. Gru said he would get groceries and she hoped he bought a lot. She felt like she was starving. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Why aren't they back? How long does it take to buy food for two kids and buy some groceries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked irritated through the house. The minions felt she was a bit irritated and were wise enough not to walk past her. Even the dog stayed away from her. Edith's thoughts still drifted off to her dreams of becoming immobile. How long would it take? Looking it up wouldn't have much effect since she knew she didn't gain normally thanks to whatever it was that Gru had invented, which was a weight gain serum. It would maybe have been a success in Japan with sumo wrestlers since they needed to become fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to become a sumo wrestler! I just want to become fat! That's all! In order to do that, I need food! Is that too much to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned against the wall and did her best to ignore the rumbling sounds from her belly. </span></div></div>",

He did it this way so the other kids and himself could have something to eat while Edith tries to eat as much as she can.

Eventually, she may not. It depends on the formula,\" Gru said in an unassuring tone. Margo frowned at this since she was concerned about her sister, but there was nothing she could do.

Margo already didn't like it that she gained and Gru didn't seem to mind it, but getting immobile on purpose was different from getting fat from eating because you got a huge hunger. <br>\r\nWithout a further thought, she dove into the bag again and started to stuff her face with everything edible in the bag. Her jaws were chewing non-stop. She almost emptied the bag when Margo and Agnes came back with some other bags full of groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it wouldn't hurt if you would help us,\" Margo said in a snappish tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry. I almost starved all alone here,\" Edith said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starve? With all the food you ate, there isn't a possible chance you would starve. You need food for energy and to grow, but all that isn't used is kept under your skin, which makes you fat like this,\" Margo said and pushed a finger in Edith's belly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith growled softly at her. She grabbed another bag of food and went to her room. Margo angrily put the groceries on the counter and looked in the direction her sister went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo. Can you come over here?\" Gru asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo got up and walked over to Gru. He took her down to his lab and looked her deep in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so mean to your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mean? I? I'm not mean to Edith. I'm just trying to help her before she eats so much that she becomes a big fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo, she can't help herself. She can't keep her hunger under control. If you keep your breath, after some time, you feel the urge to breathe,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah or else I die.,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well she feels the same with the urge to eat. The difference is she won't die if she doesn't eat, but still. You shouldn't make such a big deal about it. Besides, she said she liked getting fat,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't see a problem with that? Do you want her to become a fat, ugly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you're fat doesn't mean to say you're ugl,y Margo. It once was a sign of wealth. In the past when some one saw a fat girl, that meant she came from a rich family. Fat woman used to be attractive. You can see that in some old paintings like Rubens or Botero. The people of those paintings are fat because that's what people liked. Since being overweight and obese can kill you, people made the idea that fat is ugly. But in Edith's case, we don't have to worry about that. Besides, she's a growing girl. Nothing wrong with being a little heavy at her age,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I shouldn't care that she eats herself fat?\" Margo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least not in a negative way. Maybe I will soon find an antidote,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she said she liked the gaining. Maybe she will continue gaining even after she got the antidote!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she will, but I'll worry about it then. For now, be nice to her. It's hard enough for her already!\" </span></div></div>",

It's all going to end up in the same place. I will taste what it is,\" Edith said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes ripped open the first bag and started stuffing pretzels in her sister's waiting mouth. Agnes must admit it was a bit strange for her at first, but soon she started to enjoy it. She liked stuffing her sister full of food. Edith enjoyed it just as much. Being fed and not having to do anything except open your mouth, close it, chew and swallow was an amazing feeling. However, both were a bit scared Margo might come in and see them doing it. So both were careful if they heard something. But in the meantime, both enjoyed their feeding while Edith's belly slowly grew larger, pushing against the fabric of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Margo was in Gru's lab doing her homework. It was not that she needed Gru's help that much, but that she liked to be around him and wanted to know when the antidote would be ready.

Nothing can happen to her.

She wants it! It's you who's being mean to her! Besides, she's not eating herself to death! You heard Gru! She's not in any danger! Besides, she want to get fat! You're the only one who has trouble with it!\" Agnes yelled angrily at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost funny seeing Margo standing there. She wasn't moving, but she was just looking in the air. She was so amazed at what her little sister said, she didn't know how to react. <br>\r\nAgnes didn't put much attention to it, took the bag full of food, and walked upstairs. She slowly walked inside. Edith was still sleeping and softly mumbling in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does Margo have so much problems with being fat? Maybe something happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Margo was older than them. Did she maybe have any bad relations with fat people so long ago that she and Edith couldn't remember anything, or before they were born? She wondered.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She was still upset with her sister, wondering what she was going to tell her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agnes, I know you may be mad at me, but I have a reason. Since I am older than you and Edith, I have more memories with Mom and Dad. I know you barely remember them and Edith sort of does, but I lived with them for a while,\" Margo tried to explain, struggling to tell her sister her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... Mom and Dad used to be on the fatter side. Because of that...... I used to be a fatter kid,\" Margo admitted with a look of dissapointment on her face. Agnes opened her mouth in an amazed manner, noting how skinny her sister was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.... were fat?\" Agnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I used to be very fat. I was just bigger than Edith is right now,\" Margo said as she pointed to Edith's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you are so harsh about being fat?\" Agnes asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... sort of. I didn't mind it for a while. In fact, I did sort of like it until I turned four,\" Margo told Agnes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Agnes asked as she started to wonder. Margo breathed as if she lost air, dreading the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I turned four, I started to go into girls scouts like we are in now. I went to go try on my girl scout uniform one day. Many of the girls were a lot smaller than I was. I was huge compared to them. Anyway, I tried on the uniform and it didn't fit on me at all. My belly was poking out everywhere and I looked like I was about to pop. They didn't have another uniform on them at all and the girl scout meeting was about to begin. So I went to the meeting wearing the outfit that didn't fit me.... and.... I got made fun of to the point of tears. Everyone laughed at me and I couldn't handle it. I went home and vowed to myself that I would show them. I would become skinny like them.... even skinnier than they were. Since then, I hated the idea of weight gain and fat,\" Margo said as she finished her story. Agnes was amazed at this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Margo. I'm sorry about that. It makes sense now,\" Agnes said as she understood her sister's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind that Edith is gaining weight because she likes it. I just don't want her to get made fun of and ridiculed like I was. I don't want her to feel my pain,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't stop Edith with gaining. She likes to be fat and you can't change that. Besides, I like stuffing her. I know why you are concerned, but you can't change her mind,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to see that, but I don't want her to go through what I did. People don't like fat,\" Margo said to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe people have changed their minds about fat. You never know until you try,\" Agnes said to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I should gain weight?\" Margo asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you did, it wouldn't be that bad. What are you thinking, Margo?\" Agnes asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo had to think about it. Could she ever take that chance again? She used to like being fat, but could she ever go through the pain of it again?</span></div></div>",

If they haven't and tease me again, I don't think I can go through that again. Besides, since I tried to get skinny, my appetite decreased. I don't need much food to feel full. Besides, I'm still in ballet. If you're in ballet, you need to be skinny. There are no fat ballarinas,\" Margo said in a logical tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Edith stopped doing ballet some time ago,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. So I will accept that Edith wants to gain.

Then she will understand it,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo turned around and walked downstairs, leaving Agnes behind and a bit surprised.

It's in her genes,\" Agnes giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes slowly went back into Edith's room. Her sister was still sleeping, her belly sticking up a bit in the air.

Hey Agnes, wake up!\" Edith said while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes suddenly opened her eyes. She then remembered everything and looked at Edith with smile. Edith looked back with one of her rare happy smiles, although it was a fatter smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sis! Start feeding me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Edith, not yet. First, you have to listen to me. When you were sleeping, I had a talk with Margo,\" Agnes started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? So now you don't want me to gain weight, too? Is that it? You'll stop feeding me even when you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Edith! No! I still want to feed you and if you still want to gain weight, you have my full support. But you need to listen to what she told me. It was about our parents,\" Agnes said as she quickly told Edith what Margo said to her about how she used to be fat, getting teased, and her dramatic weight loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why she has so much trouble with you gaining weight,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that now. Why didn't she say that in the first place?\" Edith said confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe it's hard for her to talk about our parents. It's harder losing someone when you know them really well. We barely knew them. She also said that ballarinas don't need to be fat,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I stopped ballet. Remember?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"That's what I said. Anyway, she told me she would accept your weight gain. She won't stop you or say that you need to eat less, but she won't help you,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough for me,\" Edith said as she smiled at Agnes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edith, just think about it. You need to realize that there's a chance that what happened to Margo could also happen to you. They could tease you and it could become very bad. You fully understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.

I mean, I am glad that you are accepting of her choice, but what made you change your mind?\" Gru asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never told you this, but my past parents were fat. For a long while, I was really fat. I even have pictures in my backpack,\" Margo said as she took off her backpack and pulled out a photo album. She flipped to a page and showed it to Gru, who looked very surprised. It was a picture of a fat little girl in a girl scout uniform. The girl was wearing glasses, had her hair pulled back, and had a big belly for a girl of her age. Her double chin along with her belly was very prominent. Although that girl was very big, Gru had realized that it was Margo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is why you were against Edith gaining weight?\" Gru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I didn't want her to get made fun of like I did. But I realize that I can't change her mind. I can accept this,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well I am happy for you two that you worked it out. I'll only make a cure if she asks,\" Gru said as he hugged Margo, ending the fight over Edith's fat for good.</span></div></div>",

He would say, \"If you do something evil, do it in style!\" The mirrors were big so you could see your whole body from head to toe. <br>\r\nEdith pulled off her shirt, hat, and sweater and looked at her torso. Her weight gain was really starting to become more noticed to her eye. She slowly rubbed her fat. She also pulled off her skirt, shoes, and pants and looked again.

So, in reality, everything was alright.

On their toes, they walked further down the stairs and past the kitchen until they were two rooms further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made it pass them,\" Agnes whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're not there yet,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she opened a door that gave access to Gru's lab. However, first there was a stair. Slowly, they walked down and entered Gru's lab full of minions. Agnes sometimes wondered what they did. She also could never tell them apart. She wondered how Gru did it. For some strange reason, he knew exactly who was who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! So let's look and see if there's something that makes me gain weight,\" Edith continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... we need to... to be... sure it's... something that makes... you gain,\" Agnes mumbled. \"We must be... careful. Gru might have some poison here,\" Agnes continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he have that?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... he's a villain, isn't he?\" Agnes asked and giggled. \"But for some strange reason, every time I see him, I only see the perfect Dad!\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Edith added. \"He is and he really loves us. You know, I don't think any one else would be such a great Dad like Gru,\" Edith said with a fat smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only our real parents would have been better,\" Agnes said while she walked further.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"So what could make me gain weight fast?\" Edith said and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could try to ask a minion,\" Agnes suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could try, but I'm not sure I'll understand the answer. They always talk a bit weirdly,\" Edith said with reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's worth a shot, right? You could try,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't shoot, you always miss,\" Edith said and walked over to a minion and cleared her throat. \"Is there maybe something here that can make me gain faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minions looked at her.  </span></div></div>",

The amount of food she had eaten had to be the most she had ever eaten in one sittin. It was obvious that she had gained more weight as her clothes were starting to ride up. Edith's chins became more prominent along with her cheeks. Her arms were starting to sag out even more along with her big belly. Her butt was another story as it was really shaping more in form. Even though she was stuffed, she kept on wondering how much she exactly weighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Vector can tell me how much I weigh,\" Edith thought suddenly. After saying that, she wanted to slap herself in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Edith. Why would I ask Vector to do that? He's my enemy, not a friend. Is that his plan? To become my friend and make me weak?\" Edith started to wonder to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thinking time became short as Vector came through a door and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your meal, little piggy?\" Vector said with an evil grin and a moment of his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, but I know you are up to something,\" Edith said, trying to show no weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think that?\" Vector said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You have taken me for no apparent reason and fattened me up even more. There has to be some motive,\" Edith said, trying to find out the answer. Vector frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, kid. Since you really are dying to know, I'll tell you my plan,\" Vector said.</span></div></div>",

Realizing she couldn't resist, Edith opened her mouth and let the donut enter. She started to chew, noticing the donut was glazed with a sweet filling of some sort. She quickly chewed and swallowed, realizing that she actually like the taste of the donut. In some way, she felt like she wanted more of the donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it coming,\" Edith laughed as she yelled to the robotic arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after one, the donuts would enter Edith's mouth while she continued the process of chewing and swallowing. Awkwardly enough, Edith was eating the donuts in a fast paste, almost as if she was addicted to eating the donuts. At a point, she even felt like asking to shove two donuts in her mouth each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Edith continued gorging on the food, Vector was in the next room watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew she would like the donuts.

It said stuffing multiplier on it. We wanted to ask you what it did. Shortly after that, Vector came in. I don't see the bottle laying anywhere around here. So I think Edith still had it when he took her,\" Agnes concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffing multiplier, you say? Oh, now I remember it.

She must admit to herself she slowly also started to get interested in boys.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you see... I liked girls with very big breasts and a nice butt. Anyway, I made that stuff to turn a girl into the perfect girl for me. But, I never used it or else I would now probably be married to a woman with big breasts and a nice butt, and I wouldn't have you three,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the stuff makes your breasts bigger and your butt also?\" Margo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was what it was supposed to do, but... I never really tested it. I was young back then and still needed a lot to learn. Maybe it didn't worked at all. I forgot I even had that stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edith took it since she thought it could help her gain faster,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it does that. Like I said, I never tested it. Perhaps I did it right and it really does make you gain in the breasts and butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit that would be pretty nice to have hourglass shape. Boys like that,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're now more worried about how to get into Vector's house.

The whole time, she watched herself as she fattened up more and more by the mouthful. She was wondering how fat she had gotten, but in a way, she didn't care. The one thing she wondered was how much longer her clothes would stay on her. Yes, her hat was still fitting fine, but she could feel her shirt riding up more and more.

Vector immediately tickled her double chins, hoping that the girl was ticklish. To his luck, Edith started to laugh as her mouth went open. Quickly, Vector wedged the vile into Edith's mouth as it started to empty. Edith's cheeks began to fill up as she tried not to swallow the vile. However, Vector held the bottle to her mouth so she couldn't spit any of the vile out. On top of that, Vector used his other hand to plug up Edith's nose, which cut off her breathing. After a while, Edith was forced to swallow the vile so she could breathe. After swallowing, Edith immediately passed out as the vile started to run through her body. Vector watched in awe as he had set out what he wanted to do. All he had to do was wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Edith opened her eyes and looked at Vector.

Instead of giving Edith a girly outfit, Vector gave her a suit that was just like his: orange, stretchy, shiny, and big. With help from Vector's robotic machines, Edith was changed without Vector's help. She was starting to look more like a round ball as she kept on getting fatter.

Her butt looked like two over inflated basketballs. She had rubbing thighs and fat calves that if she would stand, her fat would be covering her chubby feet with her toes that looked like little round balls.

Now I don't have to use that stuffing multiplier anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what that stuff does?\" Vector asked. \"Fatten you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I don't know. Some stupid idiot dressed in terrible outfits, who is the biggest geek everyone has ever met, kidnapped me before I could ask him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dressed in terrible outfits? You're wearing the same!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I got a choice,\" Edith screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to fatten up just a bit more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith willingly opened her mouth. She must admit she liked that gaining stuff, but she wasn't planning to tell Vector that. Just at the moment he wanted to continue, he heard the doorbell. He started up the machine quickly. He then put the mask down and walked to the front door. </span></div></div>",

He then opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys want?\" Vector asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. We are selling girl scout cookies around the neighborhood for a very great deal. We were wondering if you wanted to buy some cookies,\" Margo said in her fat disguised form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your voice sounds really familiar,\" Vector said, becoming nervous with the whole stint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm new in the neighborhood, sir. Would you like to buy some cookies?\" Margo continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, little girls. I already have some in my house,\" Vector continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sir? It would mean a lot to us,\" Agnes said in her disguised form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I'm a little busy at the moment. Why don't you all come back later and we will see?\" Vector said as he slammed the door in front of them and headed back to Edith. Agnes and Margo started to look sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now, Gru?\" Agnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the man. Let's go in the car and wait,\" Gru said quietly in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as the plan didn't work out the first time, Edith was being stuffed fatter more and more. All she did was close her eyes and keep sucking on the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god! I can't believe how big I'm going to be,\" Edith thought to herself in dismay. She had always wanted to be super fat to the point where she couldn't move. But suddenly, that phrase came to her mind.... couldn't move. She was basically at that point, which meant she couldn't move without assistance, which was a big problem. This meant that she would not be able to move unless her siblings break her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll be strapped here for a while longer. Unless..... I could try and make this experience a little bit better for me,\" Edith said to herself as she started to brain storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith started to come up with a good idea. The whole time, Vector had wanted Edith to be on his side. However, she never felt the same way and was still content about that idea. But if she would play along to the idea, she could make it seem as if she was on his side, which would make it easier on her. She knew that if she played along, she wouldn't be strapped up, she could get some better clothes to wear than Vector's orange stretch suit, and she wouldn't be a prisoner, but a guest. She knew that this was greedy, but this was her evil side starting to show. She figured if she couldn't escape, why not manipulate Vector? She might as well enjoy things and make Vector do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard Vector's footsteps as her eyes were closed and she was sucking on the tube. She had to decide fast on what she was going to do.</span></div></div>",

Edith tried to talk, but that was hard since the tube was still in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to say? Oh right! You can't talk with that thing in your mouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped the machine and removed the mask from Edith's face. Edith caught her breath and looked at Vector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I will become your fat apprentice. I mean, why not? I'm planning to become a villain anyway. So why not become an apprentice from a villan like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Finally you're starting to become smart. I was afraid you didn't want to work with me. But finally, you came to your senses. Good! That's great,\" Vector smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't really like being stuck here so can you make me free? I want to be able to wander around. Oh, and I must admit that your suit does stretch, but it's not really my color. I like pink or black. So can you do something about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can let you wander around the house, but the suit is going to be a bigger problem. I, of course, could use a paint spray and spray them pink or black, but then I need to go to the store and they're closed today,\" Vector said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry. I can live longer wearing this suit, even if it isn't my color. At least no else can see me wearing this. And now please free me,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector pressed a button and Edith was free. But after she tried to push herself up, she noticed it was a bit harder than she first suspected. She of course gained a lot of weight the past time and it was a lot harder to get up. Vector pushed on a button and the back of the table where she'd been strapped up lifted itself so Edith was pushed into a sitting position. Edith carefully went into a standing position, but found it almost impossible to walk with all of her new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I can do this,\" She mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector grabbed her by one arm and helped her. Edith's first idea was to tell him to back off, but that didn't sound like something his apprentice would do. Besides, walking on her own was very difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I want to watch some T.V,\" Edith said, who got tired from all the exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course,\" Vector said and took her to the couch in front of a huge screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Edith started flicking through some channels, looking for something nice. But soon, her belly started to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Vector? I'm getting hungry. Can I have some cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can,\" Vector said and went to his kitchen. \"Let's see. Alright, I still have two boxes of girl scout cookies. Hm, those two girl scouts at my door. I asked them to come back later. Maybe they will. I really need to buy new cookies soon!\"<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

Edith was almost like a dog being fed treats as she ate the cookies out of Vector's hand, which kind of made Vector giggle quietly to himself. Edith was so zoned out from eating and watching television that she had felt relaxed for the first time in Vector's home. After ten minutes or so, the flow of cookies stopped, snapping Edith out of her relaxed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Edith asked as she looked at Vector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I ran out of cookies. Are you still hungry?\" Vector asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extremely! Could you please get me some more food?\" Edith demanded, trying to not sound too rude to Vector. She didn't want to be a prisoner again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Coming right up,\" Vector said as he walked back to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Edith knew she was alone. She really missed her siblings and wanted to go back home. She then wondered if she could be able to walk out of the front door since it was close by. Having thought of this, Edith tried to stand up out of her chair. She slowly tried to push her weight upward so she could gain momentum to stand. After moments of trying, Edith was turning red in the face, realizing yet again that she could only stand if someone else helped her. With that, she leaned back on the couch to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it. I'm way too fat for that. If anything, I need to wait for my family to rescue me. I'm just way too lazy,\" Edith said as she gave up hope and concluded that for now on, she was just lazy. The next moment, Vector walked in with a huge bowl of chocolate pudding that looked like it was a couple gallons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's ready to eat more?\" Vector asked in a silly tone. But in all honestly, Edith didn't care as she licked her lips and looked at the bowl. Part of her thought that she shouldn't because she needed to escape and gaining weight wouldn't help. However, she knew that she couldn't resist and that she was hopeless. With that, Edith slammed her head into the bowl like a dog and began sucking the pudding. Vector noticed how messy she was as the pudding got all over her hat, hair, face, and even suit. Vector smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, my little apprentice. Eat up, my fat little piggy,\" Vector mumbled with an evil grin.</span></div></div>",

Is there a special reason why you picked her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's one of those daughters from Gru. I kidnapped her and made her go to my side. I used a daughter from my arch enemy to use for my own evil. So, I can eventually beat him in crime by help from his own daughter.

He was really pulling out all the stops for the evil girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector's Dad even began to notice Edith's huge size.

I don't know where Edith is in the house, but once we get in, we need to try and be fast and not trigger any alarms.

We will get her. I promise,\" Margo said as she tried to tidy herself up in her disguise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's do it!\" Agnes said as she started to tidy herself up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, girls! We can do this. Just stick to the plan!\" Gru said as he got into the big girl scout box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the girls started to pull the wagon up to Vector's big door.

Still, they were scared Vector would see who they were, but their disguises really fooled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how many cookies of which kind would you like?\" Margo asked while her eyes looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have some kind of fattening cookies? You see I... eh... have a daughter and she is underweight and needs to fatten up a bit. So do you know some cookies that could help her?\" Vector asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I think so. We have some new kinds of cookies. Just let me look. I believe they're high in fat, but we also have those new healthy cookies. Maybe you would like to try those, too,\" Margo said as she was talking, making sure Vector didn't pay attention to Agnes, who understood and walked in another room. In the other room, she found her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes looked relieved when she saw her sister, but was then surprised to see how fat she was and then wondered how to move her. She quickly walked over to her sister and lifted the wig for a second.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"It's me silly! Agnes. Margo and Gru are here, too. We came to rescue you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I wondered what you three were waiting for. But one problem... How are you going to move my fat ass?

Quickly, Agnes took a picture of Edith, started to compose a text message, and then added Margo and Gru as contacts to the text message. After getting everything typed out, Agnes sent the message and closed her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We will get you out of here,\" Agnes assured Edith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I don't lose my fat, I'll be happy,\" Edith smirked with a fat grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only we could roll you out of here,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish, but unfortunately, that's only for the cartoons,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At this point, Agnes looked Edith over. She was so huge! Her orange stretch uniform showed every crease of fat on her fat body. She was so swollen with fat, she was just an immobile, tall ball of fat. Agnes actually noticed that Edith's voice sounded deeper from her change in size. Curiously, Agnes approached Edith and sat down on her fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you doing?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious. This weight feels so soft and comfortable! You're like a huge pillow!\" Agnes giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're lucky I'm too fat and lazy to move you,\" Edith said with a grin as she felt at home again with her sister here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gru and Margo felt their phones vibrate. While Vector was looking at a cookie pamphlet from Margo, she pulled out her phone. At the same time,Gru was doing the same in his location. To themselves, they looked at the text message. They saw the picture of how fat Edith had gotten, which made them both gasp. They began to read the text from Agnes: <i>We have a situation. Edith can't walk or move anymore! What's the plan now?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo didn't respond as she was waiting for Gru's logical call. He had came up with two plans in his mind. The first plan was to trap Vector so they could either have more time to think of how to get Edith out of Vector's or to trap him so they could keep Vector's place to accommodate Edith's needs. The second plan was much different. The plan was for Gru to go back to his place and made either a shrink ray or a ray that could get rid of Edith's fat for now, but give it back to her later. The downside to this plan was that this would take more time, which was not of the essence. After a few minutes of debating, Gru chose a plan and texted it to the girls.</span></div></div>",

In addition, Gru told the girls that he tried many ways to break in and none of them succeeded.

Making laser guns and other huge weapons that are going to be used to steal from others and create a dog with huge fangs is way better for raising three innocent girls!\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I originally didn't plan on doing that. That doesn't matter anymore, anyway. Just tie that idiot up before he wakes up. I'll go check on your sisters,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Margo mumbled while she grabbed a rope and walked over to Vector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru walked into the other room, looking around thinking what to do now. He learned to always stay calm. Suddenly, he saw the behemoth known as Edith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Edith, it seems like you gained some weight. You know, I don't care that much as long as you like it... But how are we going to move you now?\" Gru asked, looking at his obese daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't my own doing.

Meanwhile, Margo walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's tied up and he won't get free. I was one of the best of the girl scouts in making knots!\" Margo said. Suddenly, she looked at her Edith and was taken back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Edith! You're fat. What do we do now?\" Margo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking,\" Gru said. \"I'm thinking. There must be a way to get her out. Perhaps it's so obvious, we don't really think about it,\" Gru continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, little Agnes, on her sister's belly, suddenly got an idea as she enjoyed how comfortable she was. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We need to look around and see what Vector has. Maybe Vector has something that could help,\" Gru explained to Margo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the two started to tear the house apart to find something that would get Edith out of the house. During this whole time, Edith sat down on her fat ass while Agnes continued to lay down on her belly. Margo kept on trying to see if Vector had any devices that could help Edith out, but she was being met with no luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gru, are you sure Vector doesn't have a hiding place for his gadgets?\" Margo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say go ask him, but if you did that, then he would have a chance to escape!\" Gru mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about Margo's question, he thought of a place to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go check out his lab! It's around here I believe,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter minutes of searching through rooms, the two had come across Vector's lab that was filled with many contraptions. Margo and Gru split up to search around the lab. After a few minutes, Margo found some pills. She noticed that they were labeled with many different kinds of labels. Margo kept on searching through the pile of pills until she hit \"weight gain\" and \"weight loss.\" Margo grabbed a few as she came up with an idea. If anything, they could make her lose all of her weight, walk out of the house back home, and then give her the weight gain pill once they arrived back home. The bad thing was that the pills were unpredictable, which proved to be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Gru looked through Vector's guns, coming up with a simple solution. They could blast a hole in Vector's house, giving them enough room to try and roll Edith out of the place. The only downside was if people would notice Edith, ruining their escape. That and Gru wasn't entirely sure if they could even roll Edith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them approached each other and talked about their findings, trying to decide which was the best escape strategy.</span></div></div>",

Thinking logically, I doubt we could roll Edith,\" Margo said. \"Even if we could, we need to get her all the way back home and since she won't fit in the car and if we need to roll her all the way back home, I'm afraid people may start asking questions. Besides, she's now morbidly obese. I know she isn't in any danger, but other people would think she is.

Her arms that were billowed with fat looked like they were deflating along with her butt. Her thighs looked like they were starting to shrink as well. The biggest shrinking that was occurring was her round belly and boobs. After a few minutes, Edith's chubby face started to lose form and became more sharper. Because of the decrease of fat, Edith's height began to shrink as well, which made her clothes much more loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo, go back to the car and find an outfit.

Take this,\" Margo said as she handed Edith the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo was in such shock from Edith's changed body. She had not seen Edith this skinny in ages.

They all got in the car and began to drive home. The whole way back, they were all happy and rejoicing that they had Edith back. Even though they were all excited, Margo kept on thinking about the weight gain pill. She wondered just how it would work on Edith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they all got back home, they quickly went inside as Edith headed up to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gru, please bring the pills up here now.

Either way I am going to end up naked after I get fatter. I mean, hopefully I can have clothes when I am fat, but I don't really care,\" Edith said as she looked at herself in Margo's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's up to you. Go ahead and decide.

Vector is still tied for what we know and we can easily get in and out. Come on, Gru. I can go in there and get them quickly. What do you say?\" Margo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru wasn't sure of the idea, but then he looked at Edith who had a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... okay. But we need a plan just in case. Come along, Margo,\" Gru said as the two walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Edith walked over to her bed and sat on it, noticing she still had some of her mobility. Agnes looked at her sister and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuffing time, sis?\" Agnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. Fatten me up in the meantime!\" Edith said with a smile as Agnes left the room to get more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Gru and Margo pulled up to Vector's house again, both feeling some what nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I will go in there and get the pills. I'll just grab the bottle just in case. I need to find it. So if I am not out in ten minutes, come in and look for me just in case. I hope Vector is still tied up,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I got your back. Go ahead and get in there,\" Gru said as Margo stepped out of the vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Margo rushed up to Vector's house, reaching the front door in seconds. As she grabbed the knob of the door, she noticed it was still unlocked just like they had left it. When Margo entered, she looked around. The place looked empty just like they had left it. She would of checked if Vector was in the same place she left him, but she just wanted to get in and out of there. Margo ran over to the lab area where she originally found the pills. She kept on looking on the countertops in the lab, feeling that every space was similar to another. Finally, after searching for a few minutes, Margo found the bottle of weight gain pills from earlier. Quickly, Margo grabbed the whole bottle and began to walk out of the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now I just need to get out of here,\" Margo said to herself, hoping everything else would go with ease.</span></div></div>",

She just needed to know if he was still where they left him. She reached the place and went pale. Vector wasn't there anymore. Margo knew she need to get out now. But the next moment later, two hands grabbed her around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V... V... Vector. Oh! Good! You're free. I came back because I felt bad how we left you. But you're free now so I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I would fall for that? I was once a boy scout, you know. I know a lot about knots and also how to untie them. It's very handy. You know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm a girl scout,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop the act. I know who you are,\" Vector sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not acting. I really am a scout girl. However, I must admit I used my scout girl uniform to trick you,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought scouts needed to be nice, helpful, honest, and friendly. I did not think they would use their uniforms to break into someone's house!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. But that's different against someone who kidnapped their sister in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure! Now suddenly, I'm the bad guy. You know, I wanted to use your sister. But since you took her away, I need to use you. So you're going to become fat. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo's brains was working at top speed. She knew Gru would come to rescue her in a few minutes. How much could he fatten her in a few minutes? The best thing was to probably play along. She was no match for Vector.<br>\r\nVector chained Margo to a table and suddenly, he saw the bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have here?\" Vector asked and took the bottle out of Margo's hands. \"My weight gain pills. I forgot I had those. You know, this would work even better. So little girl... you wanted them? You got them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Margo could do anything, one pill dropped in her mouth. She couldn't do anything else than swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no!</i> Margo thought. <i>I don't want to go back to how I looked like. I worked too hard to get this body. He can't take it from me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next moment, she felt her body fattening up. She felt how her body became heavier and rounder. Tears were running down her face. This was what she once was and lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you crying about? You wanted those pills. Now you have them and now you're crying. Oh! Wait a second! I know what's going on. You didn't want them for you, but for your fat ass sister. Wait, I suddenly have a wicked idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVector left and Margo didn't really want to see her body. She couldn't believe what happened to her. Then, Vector returned with a familiar looking bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stuffing multiplier!\" Margo yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what it is. So what does it do? Does it fatten you up?\" Vector asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know what it was supposed to do, but it has never been tested. So I don't know what it does,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'm curious. You can become the guinea pig,\" Vector said and grabbed the bottle.</span></div></div>",

You will need it,\" Vector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Vector opened the bottle and placed the cap on a nearby counter. Without any second thoughts, he shoved the bottle into the fat girl's face. He managed to get a little bit of the chemical into her mouth. Margo did her best not to swallow until Vector plugged her nose, causing her not to breathe. Reluctantly, Margo swallowed the chemical, which lead Vector to take the rest of the bottle out of Margo's mouth. There was a lot of chemical left, but Vector had no idea how much he needed to use on Margo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a monster! Trying to fatten up little girls for your enjoyment!\" Margo screamed, feeling angry at Vector in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little girl, that's not for my enjoyment.

Edith knew that she wanted to get some clothes for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing immediately, Edith saw how Margo's laptop was right at Edith's bed side, which Edith figured that Margo had accidentally left it there at some point. Edith reached over with all of her might and just barely grabbed the computer while breaking a sweat. Quickly, she placed the computer on her belly, turned it on, and began to surf the Internet on some clothing websites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to have a new look with this new fat,\" Edith said as she started to look for her types of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time of looking, Edith had ordered herself a new outfit. Edith ordered a pair of brown boots, brown stretchy yoga pants that would expand with her body, a brown tank top that could expand with her fat body, and also a brown jacket to go with it all. She also ended up finding a new hat for herself that was brown, had tassels with balls on the ends of it, and a huge cotton ball on top that was double the size of the ones attached to the tassels. As she was evil, Edith had gotten into a habit of remembering Gru's credit card number. After typing in the information, Edith pressed a button that made the items set for overnight shipping, which made Edith really excited for her new, brown look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, she closed down the computer and hesitantly placed it on her bed side. She then noticed how the gaining pills were also right by her bed side as well. Tempted, Edith wanted to use a lot more of the pills to become even more covered in beautiful fat. Edith's longing for it was tempting her mind as she visioned her body even fatter than it was now. The only thing that troubled Edith was if she should have more pills or not.</span></div></div>",

Can you start working on an antidote right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo, I would do anything for you girls. You know that. But making an antidote isn't so easy like in the cartoons. It might take a while before I'm able to make it. Do you understand?\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. It's just those darn pills didn't only increase my weight. It also increased my appetite. If I keep eating like this, I'll be the size of cow in a few days,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. While you normally had the most willpower, now you feel weak,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all Vector's fault. He did this to me!\" Margo yelled. \"Wait a second! Didn't he have some weight loss pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. You're not going back there. No way. Much too dangerous. Besides, those pills were more powerful than the weight gain, remember? You lose more weight from the weight loss pill than you gain from the weight gain pill. And also, before this, you were kind of thin. So what would happen If you used such a pill on yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would look like an anorexic model. You could count my ribs. Maybe you could even play on them like a xylophone. Yeah, you're right. That would be too big of a weight loss. That could be very unhealthy,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I don't want you to go back to Vector. You don't want to get captured again,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. Then I would probably end up like an immobile ball of fat. Now that I'm saying this, I must admit I'm feeling hungry again,\" Margo frowned.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Seems I need to go grocery shopping again. Well, leave the pill here and I will look at it. Grab a bite to eat in the meantime,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. You can count on that,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edith opened up her eyes, noticing a few hours had passed before her and her little sister fell asleep. To Edith, words couldn't describe how great it was to be back home in her humble abode. She had missed it when she was with Vector. But now, everything she wanted was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Agnes, noticing that she was out like a rock. Edith tried to reach over and carress her hair, but felt too lazy and tired to do it. She then looked at how small Agnes was, especially compared to herself. Edith remembered the days that she would run around outside the orphanage, wearing all pink clothing and boots, while jumping in nearby puddles for fun. Those days, she was skinnier than a rail. Anyone could of picked her up and benched pressed her. However, that wasn't the case now. If someone tried to bench press her, they had to be the world's strongest man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Agnes, Edith wondered what her sister's future would be like. Sure, Agnes was small now. However, Edith was just the same and now, she was even bigger than a balloon. Edith liked her fat, but she wasn't sure if Agnes would gain weight, especially to the point of being bigger than Edith. If she ever did, Edith would support her. All Edith really could do was just wonder what her sister was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she'll be skinny like Margo once was,\" Edith whispered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Margo was big, but only because of Vector. It was not her choice to get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts circled Edith's mind as she began to fall asleep again, not noticing the time on the clock was very late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Margo was getting ready for bed. All of the time earlier, she was stuffing herself silly. Even when Gru returned with food, she continued to eat. At this point, Margo went commando into her bed since she felt like she wouldn't be able to find clothes that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to stop gaining weight. Stupid Vector. What can I do now?\" Margo asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she would keep on feeling hungry. However, she would do anything to lose the weight she had. She knew it would be difficult because of Vector's pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess tomorrow, I can ask Gru to go to the gym nearby. That and I can try to help Gru come up with an antidote. Yeah! That's a great idea,\" Margo said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she laid her fat head on the pillow. She looked down towards the middle of the bed, noticing a huge lump. She wasn't surprised to see it was her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Stupid belly,\" Margo said as she tried to push it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she did, she felt how soft it was to the touch. She began to shake it, which made her play with it. For a few minutes, she was entertained with the fat. Soon enough, she stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing? I can't like being fat. I can't,\" Margo cried. She kept on repeating herself until she cried herself to sleep with the confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edith? Edith?\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Edith began to open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... what time is it?\" Edith yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nine in the morning. Agnes is up,\" Gru said as Edith began to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you get me up?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have a package,\" Gru said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Edith was going to try her new look.</span></div></div>",

But still, he need to make sure that this wouldn't happen again. He quickly bend over to Edith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edith, my dear daughter, next time if you want to order something and pay with my credit card, just ask. I love you and I would get almost anything for you and let you do almost anything you want,\" Gru admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't let us see that movie two weeks ago,\" Edith remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That movie was very scary,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was called \"Silence of the Lambs.\" How scary can a movie about a few fluffy white lambs be?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was for seventeen years and older. Believe me. No parent would let their kids watch that. But believe me, I would have bought those clothes for you if you would have asked me,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's time to put them on,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru left the room to give Edith some privacy. Edith was very fat and some things were getting difficult for her to do. However, she was able to get out and into the clothes on her own even while she must admit it was getting kind of difficult. After some time, she would really need help to get dressed. But for now, she could do it on her own. <br>\r\nShe liked the brown clothes a lot. She remembered hearing some girls at school that looked like fashion dolls say that they would never wear something brown. Edith never really cared what those girls or anyone else thought of her except for her sisters and Gru. She put on her clothes, and since they were very stretchy, the fitted nice around her fat body and showed clearly every roll of it. But in a way, she liked to show how fat she has got. But, she also remembered hearing those same girls making fun of fat girls who were by now way thinner than her. But she didn't really care because she liked it. Agnes and Gru liked it, and Margo sort of... and that was all that mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo opened her eyes slowly and almost screamed after seeing a huge ball in front of her. But suddenly, she remembered that it was her belly. She cursed Vector again and turned on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did this happen to me?\" Margo asked herself. \"Wasn't I always a nice girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to get up. Slowly, she got up and took her clothes, noticing how tight they were. If she would keep gaining like this, she wouldn't been able to wear those clothes much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope Gru can find an antidote. If I and Edith both are fat, people might start thinking Gru isn't taking good care of us and then we would need to deal with child services. It would be hard to find an explanation for them,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly started to rumble. Margo suddenly noticed how hungry she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to go to the gym and help Gru making an antidote, but it can't hurt taking on breakfast first,\" Margo convinced herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Man, I really look good in this new outfit,\" Edith said as she observed herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, she couldn't be any happier with her new look. She kept on looking to see how much she liked it. When looking at herself, the first thing that attracted her eye was her brown tank top that she was wearing. The shirt had lines acrossed it with a lighter shade of brown, giving it a nice design. The shirt was long enough as it covered her whole fat belly. However, the tank top was very tight around her middle section of fat. Because of this, all of her fat rolls were easily seen through the outlines of her tank top. In addition, because it was a tank top, some of her upper chest fat spilled out of the area where her arms are. This also helped with her boobs as she looked like she had fully developing ones that stuck out a little ways. Even though she knew that at some point she would burst out of this shirt from fat, she loved how it fitted on her. This dragged her eyes down to her new pair of brown yoga pants. Since her thighs rubbed together, she looked like she had even more layers of fat. All the way down her legs, the pants showed every crease from her gained weight. This especially made her butt look more round and prominent. Finally, she looked up into the mirror and noticed her huge hat. She started to tie the tassels around her neck that had double chins. She started to position her hat correctly onto her head, completing her awaited outfit. Overall, she was completely satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should order more clothes like this. This is perfect for me,\" Edith said as she began to think of what she should order next. Since Gru said he would do it, she didn't mind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her new look, Edith felt in some ways she was more older. Although she really wasn't older, her fat helped her make her seem like it. Her voice was lower than before from her sheer mass, and because of her huge amount of fat, she had grown some what taller, adding a few more years to her look, which was not necessarily a bad thing. But before she could continue to admire all this, Edith suddenly noticed that Agnes was right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You scared me!\" Edith said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. I just got up. I didn't recognize you with all of the new clothes on for a minute,\" Agnes said, making Edith blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you like it?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it looks more cute with all of your fat. It shows you off well,\" Agnes admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much! I will try and order more clothes like this later,\" Edith admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went to sit onto the bed as Agnes turned the television on. Immediately, the news came on with a man dressed up reading off to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the weather today should be nice and sunny with the humidity being low. Sounds like great weather for the State Fair today at Hillow State Fair Grounds. Come on down today and join us for the annual Deep Fried Food Eating Contest! It consists of multiple rounds, foods, and a secret grand prize. Open to all ages and the contest starts at 1:00!\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Agnes looked at Edith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should do that, Edith. You would totally win it. And it's only 10:45 right now. We could make it and you could enjoy the food and get even fatter!\" Agnes mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith knew that this would be a great opportunity. Plus, if she won, she could win a secret prize. Each year, the prize was great. One year, the winner won a free supply of pizza for two years. Another time, a winner won $5,000 dollars. The prizes differed each year. Edith debated on if she should do it or not. Agnes made a pretty strong arguement.</span></div></div>",

There were three empty plates in front of her. She was slowly chewing on some kind of food. Her belly looked even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you wanted to lose weight. Not gain it,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. But I can't help myself. I'm just so hungry. Stupid Vector. All those years I tried to stay thin. And now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, there's a State Fair today with a deep fried food eating contest.

For Edith. I mean, she wants to eat and get fatter. She eats a lot lately. I'm sure she's going to win. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You want to write Edith in for the contest. Sure, go ahead. Maybe a state fair could help get my mind off of food. I will come, too,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes took the elevator down to Gru's lab. She had been here many times, but sometimes, she still thought it was a  bit scary. A lot of the stuff here was dangerous of course. She herself would have painted it in nice colors. After looking around for a while, she found Gru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Daddy! Edith and I were watching T.V and there's a State Fair with a deep fried food eating contest at 1:00 with a big prize. Edith wants to join. Can we, Daddy? Can we? Please?\" Agnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru looked at one of his three girls. He was busy finding an antidote for Margo, but he thought Edith and Agnes also deserved a treat. Besides, a State Fair could also be nice for Margo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. That sounds like fun. You know what? Help Edith down and I will be upstairs in a few minutes,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Hooray!\" Agnes cheered while jumping in the air. \"We're going to the state fair!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGru looked smiling at Agnes who ran upstairs. Then he saw a few of his minions looked at him. With big smiles, he understood what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not coming with us.

Before moving too far, Gru looked down at Edith to see her getting tired. He quickly found an area that would let one use a wheel chair for anyone who needed it. With that, Gru looked down at Margo and noticed how she looked even bigger. Since she was the oldest out of the group, Gru wanted her to have some sense of independance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo, we are going to go watch Edith in the contest. I understand that you want to stay away from food. So I will give you thirty dollars to go play games, ride rides, or do whatever you want in the mean time. How does that sound?\" Gru said with a grin as he passed the money to Margo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" Margo said as she hugged Gru. Soon enough, she started to walk around while the others headed to the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo passed by the stalls where the animals were. She saw all of the little piglets crowd around each other in a stall while a worker began to feed them. Continuing on her walk, she started to see the horses running around in a circular tent as little kids began to ride for their personal enjoyment. This cycle continued for a while until Margo heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come get your hot dogs and elephant ears! Hot dogs and elephant ears!\" A worker called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the smell of hot dogs, french fries, pretzels and elephant ears began to put Margo in a trance. She stopped and began to think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat this food. But it's so enticing!\" Margo thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw someone walk by with a elephant ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe one.... or two... can't hurt,\" Margo said as she forgot about her problems and began to walk to the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Edith was sitting at a table with a bunch of other people who were of different shapes and sizes. Some were fatter than Edith, but some were just skin and bones. Many different people of ages, genders, and sizes were gathered around as the contest was about to begin. Edith looked over at her family. She suddenly noticed a guy next to Gru in a brown suit with dress pants and a tie. Edith could automatically tell that this was the manager of the whole State Fair, which is basically the same thing as an owner of a traveling carnival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, contestant! The food will be placed in front of you. Whoever eats all of the servings of food first wins! There will be fifteen plates that will be presented to you. It could be anything fried! So be prepared,\" the announcer called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA plate of food began to be placed in front of each contestant. Edith immediately noticed the smell and saw that it was a funnel cake drenched with sugar on top. She licked her lips knowing that this would be a piece of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your marks, get set, GO!!!\" The announcer called as Edith went head first into the plate with a solid lead.</span></div></div>",

You need to keep eating while some of the others can't eat anymore. But suppose when two or more people remain, you also have to be the first to finish it. But it could be that Edith is the only one left. That way she wins automatically,\" Gru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gru? I have just one question: After the contest is over, can I try to win another unicorn for my collection? Pretty, pretty please?

A few people stopped, but Edith and the others were busy with plate number seven, which was spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs.

Edith was finally on her last bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Edith! You can do it,\" Gru said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Edith put the piece of chicken to her mouth, bit on it, and sucked off the meat until there was a clean bone in front of her. Finally, Edith was done as she had won the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the winner is...... Edith!\" The announcer yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl,\" Gru screamed while the crowd applauded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though everyone seemed to be celebrating, Edith looked at the contestant's plate next to her, noticing how his plate still had the full turkey leg on it. Like a pig, Edith reached over and began to dig into the turkey leg. She kept on eating and eating even though the contest was over. Finally, after a few minutes, the manager of the fair approached her while Gru and Agnes approached her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, young girl! You have won! Before I can give you your prize, I need to speak to your Dad,\" said the fair manager as he pulled Gru away for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you?\" Gru asked him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sir. My name is David Smiles. You see, I run this fair as it travels to multiple places across the world. I have had an eating contest like this for a while with no one left to complete the challenge. However, your little girl is the first. I can use an act like her in our show,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An act?\" Gru asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You see, people are entertained by these things. Most importantly, your daughter looks very happy. This has made me think of a great deal for us both,\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Gru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you see, the grand prize was to send the person to a camp for two weeks where they can be fattened and all of that for their enjoyment. However, I have a better idea. Well, I would love to bring your daughter on tour. It would be for as short as two weeks to as long as two months. Instead though, she and your family will be paid well for it. If you would like, you can come on tour with her, send another guardian with her, or just send her. Anything is fine. It seems that she enjoys getting fatter. I can promise you I could do so much more for her than the camp that can be offered. And I'll pay you big,\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much are you talking?\" Gru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for now, we can start off at $30,000 for two weeks. I bet that would help, right?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru began to think about it. All in all, Gru wasn't being selfish. All of this would benefit Edith. Sure, he could take her to the camp, but this would be such a great way for Edith to embrace her gluttony.   </span></div></div>",

It's her prize after all. Sure go ahead.\" The man said with a bright, white smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith looked pretty happy. Her belly was very bloated from all the food in it. She let out a loud belch and rubbed her hands over her belly and massaged her gut sending ripples through her fat. She seemed very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Edith! You won the contest!\" Agnes cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was easy. The others did't put up much of a fight. It was delicious. What's my prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to talk to you about that.\" Gru said friendly. \"The prize was send you for a camp two weeks were you can be fattened up all for your enjoyment. That's the prize, or.... you can go on tour for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith looked with a puzzled look at Gru and her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right perhaps it's just me but I think I'm  not getting something here. I entered a contest. I won and now you tell me something about a strange tour? What do you mean by that? I seem to have missed some information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man who entered the contest thought that instead of going to a camp for two weeks were you can be fattened up...  he will take you on tour. Yo will be an act in his show. It seems people are entertained by those things. We will go with you of course and we get 30,000 for two weeks. But it's up to yo. It's your prize but I though that this was such a great way for you to embrace your gluttony.\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sounds good and all... Is that Margo?\" Edith asked suddenly distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru and Agnes also turned their head to see the girl it was Margo without a doubt. But her belly was big and round and stuck out forward and ripped the fron't of her clothes. She was crying softly walking around the State Fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Edith remember where we were talking about and we will continue that talk later.\" He said and ran over to Margo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can be a act in a show.\" Edith mumbled. \"That can be fun. In a way. But that camp were I can be fattened up also sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... But I guess you can always go to that camp again. Later. Camps are hold every year and this is perhaps a once in a life time chance, and this way it's also fun for us since we can go on tour with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Margo wants to come with the state fair. I have't seen her this sad for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margo what happened?\" Gru asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... w... well ...you... g... gave... me those... hose... thirty... d... dollars...and I... I... I spend it on food! When I smelled it I just... I just could't stop myself! I'm such a weak, worthless, stupid girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. You're not.\" Gru said. \"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Margo too Edith and Agnes and Edith said: \"I decided. I choose for...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could send my minions but they would be worthless for that. I don't have many friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about your mother?\" Edith asked flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru looked surprised at her. That was't such a bad idea. His mother loved the children. Watching two of them for at least two weeks would be great for her. Then she could also go on some sort of vacation and spend time with at least two of her grand kids. She would be surprised at Edith's new weight but Gru thought that if Edith and Agnes could probably convince her that they really liked it she would be fine with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Idea Edith. I call her right away.\" Gru said and took his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now he could stay at home without having to worry about them. He knew for sure his mother would watch over them if everything went on all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo and Agnes in the meantime looked at the ponies and some other animals at the petting zoo.

I'm looking for the unicorns. I wonder where they keep them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo sighed. Telling Agnes the did't excised was a lost cause.

She had totally no self control. Well she used to have it before Vector gave her that stuff. She did hate him before and now even more.

She felt sorry for Margo. Her sister wanted to stay thin so badly but she just could't control herself. It was't even her fault. a lot of her weight  was thanks to Vector. Also the fact that her hunger was greater then her will power was thank to to him, and poor Margo was the victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Margo. Everything will become all right with you. In the meantime try to enjoy your flabby body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't stay this size forever little sis. As soon if Gru find a antidote I'll be back to my old self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you 100% sure sis. I mean the antidote will let you lose the weight you gained but will it also let you lose the weight you gained by eating. You just eat for $30 of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Margo's face got a bit more pain full. There was a big chance Agnes was right. This time. But at the other hand after the antidote she would probably get her will power back and she would be able to work the weight off. Probably. After all she did it before. Once. Fine that was years ago but still. After that she could continue ballet. But she would rather die then let all the other skinny dancers with their stick figures see how fat she was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we will see about that. Anyway have a fun time on that trip sister, and keep an eye at Edith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will don't worry.\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girls it's time to go home.\" Gru said. \"We need to pack your bags for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except for me.\" Margo mumbled.         </span></div></div>",

He bought her multiple shirts and tank tops, multiple pairs of sweat and yoga pants, and even bought her matching hats going to each clothing style.

Everyone stayed in campers on the fair ground and relaxed as the next few days would bring numerous amounts of activities for everyone. Edith and Agnes were just relaxing and watching television when the assistant to the manager came in to the camper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, girls. Edith, you're needed for a special task. Put on your biggest outfit for now,\" the assistant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special task?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know what it is. You'll find out,\" he continued while Edith waddled to her room in the back to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come?\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Agnes. Maybe someday when you are as big as Edith here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes then began to think. She had no idea if she would ever want to be fat. She liked the feeling, the look, and everything else that it did to one's body. But to her own? She was unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts faded as Edith walked back in. She was wearing a big pair of yoga pants, a light blue sweater that fit around her big frame, and a blue winter hat with tassels and the hugest puff ball on top. As she came out, Edith was directed to go to the main entertainment tent while the assistant stayed with Agnes. Quickly, Edith waddled outside and went into the main tent, which was luckily very close by for her own benefit. She walked in to find the manager at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are hungry, Edith,\" the manager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always am,\" Edith grinned. \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am paying you big money. That means we need to make you super fat. I want to break world records with you, make you well known, and happy. That is why I want to stuff you whenever possible,\" the manager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, footsteps were heard nearby. A kid walked out the shadows. He had blonde hair that was long and a little in his face. He looked like Edith in some ways, but was very skinny with blue eyes and a small tan. He was definitely Edith's age and she noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The setup for her is ready,\" the kid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Cody. Edith, this is my nephew. I adopted him not too long ago when his parents passed away. He will assist you,\" the manager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Cody said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Edith's mind went blank and she blinked. She began to fantasize him eating fudge and weighing around eight hundred pounds while he began to wink to her. Edith felt really turned on for a girl her age. Suddenly, she snapped out of the day dream and saw Cody put his hand out with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Edith,\" she grinned. Already, she thought she found love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I will let you two get acquainted. Cody, start stuffing her,\" the manager said as he began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the tent, I have at least a twenty foot long table full of food. Do you want me to force feed you by hand or with a tube?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith just wanted the boy and to get fatter. It did not matter to her.</span></div></div>",

She really liked this boy, and she liked it very much if he fed her by hand. She looked at all the food on her table. It all looked delicious. Being stuffed with delicious food, get fatter, eat as much if you can and be fattened up by a cute boy. Life was good. She hoped Agnes was doing okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes was still in the room with the assistant. She looked doubtful at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... she's your sister. You don't look like her, and neither of you looks like your dad.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're adopted. But we're really sisters.\" Agnes said. \"What did  you mean when you said: \"one day when you're as big as Edith.\" What did you mend by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you sister is fat. Very fat. People are amused by that. If you also become her size you can also become fatter, just like her. The we have the fat sisters. That will look nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to tell you the truth I don't really know about that.\" Agnes said. \"I like Edith, her weight gain, feeding her, her fat, rubbing her belly and all but I'm not sure about getting fat by myself. Edith wanted to do that and I wanted to help her but gain weight just for me... I don't know. I'm not sure if I want myself to become fat. Besides I'm not a big eater or anything. I have a normal appetite for a girl my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her thoughts she added a love for candy and anything sweet. She was a real sweet tooth. Gru always told her that was because she was such a sweet girl. As sweet as sugar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't wanna gain?\" He asked. \"Then why did you come with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep her company. Margo and Gru also wanted to come but my sister has to deal with a problem first, after that the'll come too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your sister got pregnant perhaps?\" He asked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! Why would you... Because I said she had problems. Well not that kind of problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious. I saw your sister at the fair. That bugle in her belly made it look like she was probably pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is't. She... well that does't mind. She just has a small problem. When that's taken care of they join us. But I was't planning to gain. We talked about Edith. She would gain. No one said I also need to gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess if you don't want you don't have too. I go look how your sister's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith in the meantime was happy. Opening her mouth wolfing down whatever the boy gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat this my cute fatty.\" He said with a smile showing his pearl white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feed me more!\" Edith yelled and opened her mouth wide.           </span></div></div>",

She couldn't understand what he was saying and why, but it didn't sound pretty. Margo looked at herself in the mirror. Her belly stuck out very far. All she kept on thinking was if society wouldn't accept it, then she couldn't either. She didn't want to be the laughing stock to people around her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered back to the days when she was fat as a child. For example, one Christmas, her parents called her down to open up gifts Christmas morning. She waddled downstairs in her red pajama top and pants. Being a younger child, her fat was spread out all over and her belly was bare as it stuck out between her clothes. She was given a stocking full of various kinds of candy. While she opened up gifts, she kept on eating the candy. She ended up eating so much of it, her parents looked over at her and noticed when her pajama pants ripped right off. All they did was laugh at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like someone is trying to beat Santa in fat,\" her Dad said as he laughed at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo, still being young and happy, smiled back with her chubby cheeks. That was the one moment in life where she was fine with the fat. She, in a way, kind of liked her fat self at the time. As she grew older, her ideas on it changed. Kids kept on making fun of her, parents did too, and she knew that she couldn't continue to be the laughing stock. That lead her to lose all her weight. Unfortunately now, all of her loss was gone in the fat she currently had, making it seem like the old Margo was dissolved in body weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept on thinking, Gru entered her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Margo,\" Gru said with a tired stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Margo asked, curiously wondering if this would be about the weight gain serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know for sure now what will be your future with the fat on your body,\" Gru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What is it?\" Margo asked in nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGru was ready to answer her.</span></div></div>",

But she knew it was kind of expansive and now she got it for free and got even paid to eat it. She looked at all the food on the table and knew for sure she could easily eat all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ladies and gentleman, Glutty Edith. Believe it or not but she's able to eat all this food all by herself. Yeah she has a really big appetite but you can easily see that. The fattest little girl in the world. If she's not the fattest well... she soon will be. With what she eats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith grinned hearing this. But she must admit she was curious. Could there be a young girl fatter then her. She doubted it but a little green seed of envy was planted. She wanted to be the fattest. She wondered if there could be a fatter girl. She would ask that after the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes in the meantime was watching from a special place seeing how her sister stuffed herself. She was kind of proud at her sister and how fat she was even if she was't on planning getting fat herself she liked seeing her sister getting fatter. This way she also could travel a bit. In other cities she could perhaps find unicorns she did't own yet and smiled. <br>\r\nShe did miss Gru and  Margo a bit, but was happy with the life here, and it seemed like Edith enjoyed it too. Especially if you saw how she was wolfing her food down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes was right. Edith liked this but the audience that watched her eating grew. More and more people stopped to watch the gluttonous girl stuff herself. Edith heard people whisper and be amazed and interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah folks. This girl will keep eating. How big will her appetite grow. How fat will she get? No one could tell. You can only see it here. Tell your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith rolled with her eyes. He did his best but she doubted most of them would come back. Maybe next year. How fat would she be then. Like he said: No one could tell how fat she would become. How fat would she become? She never thought about that.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Since she had a hard time moving in her ball form, she was happy she didn't have to move very far to get from place to place. When Edith got into the kitchen area, she looked at the table and opened her mouth in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes was laying on the table with the bowl over her head. Edith suddenly began to remember what happened. When Edith went to bed, Agnes was still finishing up the candy. She had forgotten that candy was Anges's weakness. She would eat as much of it as she could until it was gone. Edith personally liked cake, but she could understand why Agnes would be very content with candy. To help her sister, she called her name since she had a harder time moving her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agnes?\" Edith yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, like a dog, Agnes snapped out of her slumber and looked at her caller while removing the bowl from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Oh, morning Edith. Did I fall asleep?\" Agnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the looks of it, you did,\" Edith laughed while Agnes joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That candy was so good. I may get some more,\" Agnes said as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Agnes rolled off the table, Edith open her mouth in surprise. To her eyes, Agnes had gained some weight. Edith could tell that Agnes's belly was a little more swollen than usual. Since her body was a lot smaller, it was a lot easier to tell. If Agnes kept this up, Edith knew that she would be a fat little girl in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that Edith was nervous about was if she should or shouldn't tell her sister what she noticed. To be honest, Edith kind of liked Agnes's belly and Edith knew that she would always be the fatter sister. However, she wanted to try and get Agnes to go along with it. She had no idea what to do.</span></div></div>",

She was never negative about the weight gain but it was always Edith's weight gain. Never her weight gain. Perhaps she did't want to get fatter herself, maybe she did't cared. She never tried to gain weight on purpose but never tried to lose weight. Before she drank that stuff in Gru's lab none of them ever thought about gaining or losing weight. Well if they had to believe Margo she had been busy with it a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can ask Cody to get you some more candy. If you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be nice to have something to munch on while you stuff your face.\" Agnes said and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So you're gonna watch your big sister get bigger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I always enjoyed seeing you get fatter. But I must admit I miss Margo and Gru a bit. They are like family. Just like the minions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on. I understand you miss them. But we see them soon. Until then we can have a fun time together right. Just the two of us. We are family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and Cody walked in carrying in his arms something pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Edith. Sorry I need to disturb you this early but I was asked to give you this. Is today's costume for your show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's costume? So I need to wear different costumes each day?\"Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know exactly. Perhaps he tries a few different outfits and then makes up his mind. At the other hand variation is also nice.\" He said while he hold up the pink thing. It was a elastic shirt and pants with a fat piggy drawing on it. \"Look this on has a pig on it. I can help you get dressed if you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. But you know what... You can get another bowl of candy for Agnes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cody left Edith looked at the costume. She liked her job but why did she need to wear such stupid clothing. She really hated this one. But she knew she needed to put this one on and she managed to get it on with some help of Agnes. In her new outfit she walked to the stage.  </span></div></div>",

Finally, the lights were down in the area and she could not see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!\" The announcer started off as normal.

Immediately, she looked around for the food so she could bury her head in it and eat her sorrows out. Finally, she saw a pig trough that was filled with a green jello-like substance. The trough was big, which made her assume it was for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never eaten slime before. This is weird,\" Edith admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few more seconds of sitting there, she moved over to the trough. She did not want to keep on feeling the way she was: embarrassed.

To her surprise, it was the best thing she ever tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" She said as she literally slammed her head into it and started shoveling as much as she could in her mouth.

She kept munching on the candy during this until the bowl was empty.<br>\r\nLater after the show Agnes waited in their room until her sister walked in. Well it was more waddling. It was obvious Edith was having trouble to getting around or even move. She got to a chair and with a satisfied sigh went sitting in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a hard day work. Did you see me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I saw you. Eating that... what was it? That green stuff. It looked awful. Like somebody barfed it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know what it was but it tasted terrific. It was really delicious. I would't mind eating it again. It was even worth the embarrassment.\" Edith mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embarrassment? So you were embarrassed. I was wondering about that. The way that man introduced you was very mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit I did't liked it but well I did get a lot of good food to eat. That was kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave you some green slime. You don't even know what it was. I think it's kind of wrong what he does. That you eat is all right. We agreed to that. But the embarrassing that's just wrong. He could introduce you like: Glut Edith or something. If you like that name. The same goes for the clothes. If you don't like them I guess you can ask for other clothing. Clothing that you like more.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"You know at my size there is't much choice at clothes you can wear. You wear the clothes that fit. Not because they look good but because they fit you. That sounds a bit strange to a little girl like you.\" Edith smiled while she looked at Agnes tummy that did look just a little bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it does't sound strange. But I think he could ask you if you like his clothing. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I hate it. That stupid Santa outfit and dress like a pig girl.

At least it was enough to ruin her clothes. <br>\r\nShe also did't know what to do.

I will decide what I do... later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her clothes on and looked at herself. Even her face got a bit chubbier. She could resist to make a plopping sound on her cheeks.

That fat woman that helps around. She's not near your size but she used to be very fat. I heard she and her mother traveled around with a freak show. Her mother used to be the fat lady. After she was born it became the fat lady and her fat daughter. Anyway after her mother died she stopped and lost a lot of weight... but I guess she might know a way to gain weight since she used to be fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then let's go.\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier said then done. Not that it was so far to her trailer but moving was getting harder and harder for Edith and she got very fast out of breath. But finally they reached the trailer of Miss Ricken. Edith looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a big trailer.\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she used to be a fat daughter of a fat lady. She did lost a lot of weight... but she's still pretty fat. In a small trailer she could barley move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked on the door and a young teenager girl with beautiful golden hair friendly smile and a hourglass shape opened the door. She smiled friendly at the two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee you are't you that new kid. Glutty Edith right?\" She said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am but I must say I hate that name.\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that. We're not always treated nicely. Hi Cody. How is it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but eh is you mother home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is. Come in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit must admit the trailer looked pretty nice inside. It made you feel welcome and wanted. In a big chair was a fat woman some where around 300 pounds. Fat but thin compared to Edith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Cody. Nice to see you again. So you're Edith. I heard about you. The eating girl. I used to do that too. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you used to be the fat daughter of a fat lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was but that's years ago.  years and years ago. I have my own daughter now, and son, and husband. They're not fat. I'm perhaps a bit fat but compared to you I'm normal sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we wanted to ask you something?\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith saw the girl was playing a card game with a boy a bit younger then her. But both lost attention to their game and looked at the two kids who were talking with their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can ask me any thing Cody.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Edith wants to become fatter, and I thought since you used to be a daughter of a fat lady and needed to be fat you might knew a trick to gain weight easy. So... do you know a trick... or two?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

For me, there were certain things that I had to do a lot of to become fatter. With you right now, your metabolism is definitely not high anymore, so these methods will really help. First off, eat constantly even when you are off the stage. And I mean almost every waking moment. That, or when you get offstage, drink weight gain shakes because the weight will pile on very fast,\" she started off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What else?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the one thing my mother and I would do is have night time stuffing. A few times a week, we would try and stay up very late and feast as much as possible. That's something you can do tonight and it will help,\" she continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole time, Cody was writing down the tips on a small notepad to help out Edith. She kept on going on as she told Edith to eat completely unhealthy and junk like food. The tips kept flowing and Edith seemed excited. Finally, the lady gave Edith a final piece of advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Thank you for that. I guess I have one question: What do I do about the ridicule? Like the costumes they give me, and my Glutty Edith nickname?\" Edith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady sat there for a moment and thought about the question. Finally, she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embrace it,\" the lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Edith said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear me out. I know that the stuff can be annoying, but you need to think of it more positively. They are giving you free food, money, and fulfilling your dreams. Yes, the costumes may suck. Trust me, I know. But what my mother and I discovered was that they did this for the first few months since they were not sure if we would be an act to stay around. If you stay around, I promise it will get better and the costumes will be a lot better,\" the lady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith felt a sigh of relief when hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, as for the nickname, I know you look at it and it make you mad, but you should be proud of it. They call you that because you are one of the biggest little girls, and that is a goal for people like us who want and love to be fat. Think of it that way. If you take it with pride, you will love it a lot more. It actually has a small ring to it. But trust me on this advice,\" the lady said with a wise smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith began to think of what the lady was saying. Even though Edith was stubborn, she felt that the lady was right. Maybe all of this was not so bad after all, and the lady even said it would get better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much,\" Edith said as she had Cody help her up since she was so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Come back if you ever need anything else,\" the lady said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Edith and Cody got out of the trailer and began to head back to the tent they were in before. Edith felt happy knowing that now, she had a mentor. Edith was feeling more like she was on top of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do Edith?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith immediately licked her lips.</span></div></div>",

Guess I fell asleep.\" Agnes said. \"Say Edith did I really gain much weight?\" She asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean. Because you dungarees snapped? Perhaps they just shrunk in the wash and after all you're a growing girl.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I should't worry?\" Agnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. What's the worst what could happen.

You just have to move this stick and move it in the direction you wanna go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit like a video game.\" Edith said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps but be careful.

As a matter of fact, as she began to think that, she felt hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. Maybe I should go ahead and get some weight gain shakes,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Edih tried to raise her body out of bed, but this proved to be difficult with her sheer amount of fat. It took her at least ten minutes before she finally got out of bed and into the wheelchair, but she felt exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting so much harder to do. I may need Cody's help more,\" Edith thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Edith rolled her electric wheelchair into the kitchen. Edith was surprised with how efficient the piece of equipment was especially in regards to her weight. All she hoped was that when she got fatter, it would still work. Edith went over to the refrigerator and found that Cody had pre-made some weight gain shakes for Edith. She tried to reach for them as best as she could, but she was too fat to have the energy to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to text Cody,\" Edith said immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a cell phone and typed: \"Hey Cody!

Edith did't waste a moment and buried her head in the slime eating like if her life depended on it. Almost inhaling the slim. She was eating so fast a few times she almost thought she would choke but she always managed to swallow it all. She loved this. She did't cared about her costume anymore no matter how bad it was. She did't cared how embarrassing it was. The only thing she cared about now was eating the slime and grow fatter, and fatter, and fatter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you people! Did't I told you? She is a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started to cheer. Edith must admit that she liked the cheering. She belched loudly what caused the audience to laugh. Edith just kept eating.

The pig outfit was already pretty tight when she put it on with help from Cody but she suddenly noticed that she heard some cracking noises at the seams. Probably the outfit would rip soon if she did't stopped eating. One side of her would like it if she gained so much she would rip the outfit, she suspected it would also amuse  the audience too, but she did't wore anything under her outfit so she would be completely naked. Also her pants were skin tight and would probably also spit any second. But there was still slime left in the trough. She wanted to keep eating. Suddenly a new barrel was emptied in her trough and she could help herself. She need to keep eating.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes people that's our piggy! Edith. Never saw such a fat girl? Well I admit she's unique! Only here you can see piggy Edith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith just kept on eating. Stopping was't a option. She just kept on eating.

Her stomach and boobs had so much pressure against her shirt, it ripped quicker than you could say wow. The outfit ripped down the middle, and then started to fall off of her sides. At this point, Edith was topless with only her pants left on. Edith knew this happened, but she kept on eating the slime and tried to only focus on that. At this point, her boobs and stomach hit the ground, making her really resemble a pig. What she didn't realize was that her pants were going to be next. A minute later, the same thing happened to her pants as they eventually ripped and fell off her sides. Now at this point, her whole body was available for the world to see. But in all honesty, she just kept on eating the slime and focusing on that as all she wanted was to get fatter. Normally, people would be shocked, but the crowd wasn't as they stood up and applauded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that! She has taken obesity to a new level!\" The announcer yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Edith, her lower area was covered by her stomach, but the audience could see her ginormous boobs, butt, and stomach.

It are big thanks so it must be a big trailer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked further looking and was about to give up when she noticed some of the tanks. She walked over to them but they were empty. Lying next to a pretty big trailer. Agnes tried the door but it was locked. Agnes felt in her hair and found a ordinary hair pin and picked it in the lock. Gru learned it her and her sisters when they once locked themselves outside. He said it could always come in handy to know these kind of tricks. <br>\r\nShe carefully opened the door and walked in.

I did't want to be there so I ran away. Came here and hide between some stuff and traveled away with them. Of course they found me and decided I could stay here if I would do some chorus. One of them was help your sister. However I must admit I do like her, perhaps more then just like... but I'm just a boy who does chorus. They don't tell me what's in the slime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Cody you have to help me. Today on the stage. Her clothes ripped of and everybody saw her naked butt. That was pretty embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know. I was't so happy with that either. But I have nothing to say around here. You I can say something but sometimes they don't even listen or if they don't like it they don't even react. So I can't do much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we gotta do something.\" Agnes squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first I need to get some slime for you sister. Then we can talk about what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still wanna give her slime?\" Agnes asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if this stuff is really addicting, then she is already addicted. She won't become any more addicted. Besides this stuff is't bad for you. All right it does make you gain but that's what your sister wants so...., and she wants the slime. I like her so I get it for her. It can't do her any harm now could it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes had trouble understanding it, but Edith wanted the slime and get fatter from it, and she was already addicted. More slime would't make a difference. It was't like drugs that more would kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith carefully walked with Cody to the tanks. She looked around if she saw the man but did't saw him anywhere. Cody filled a bucket with slime. and they walked to the tent of Edith.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He was going to talk to the man running this whole thing and give him a piece of his mind. He wanted to be careful and not get Edith fired since this may be the type of career she would have. However, something needed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Edith who was snoring decently loud. He couldn't believe at how much fatter she had become since her time here. Even though the slime was addictive, Gru could tell it had done a number on her body. She even had boobs as Gru could tell through her clothing. Her arms looked like they were about to sink into her body. Overall, she was a huge body of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how this will turn out,\" Gru said mysteriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, he began to walk out of the trailer and the door shut. Edith, who was snoring and asleep, woke up. She started to yawn and try and stretch her arms to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..... Hungry,\" Edith said in a tired voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down right now, all the little girl could think about was slime. The taste, the texture, everything about it. She tried to move, but when she did, it was to no avail from how big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do?!\" Edith said as she felt like she was going to die of starvation. Her temptation was definitely now weak.</span></div></div>",

In this case, it was Edith who continuously was getting bigger from the sheer amounts of food she was eating. Currently, Margo helped dress Edith in something she would be interested in. Since Edith was constantly growing and did not have too much of a wardrobe to choose from, Margo tried to help her change into a more comfortable wardrobe. Edith was now wearing a skin tight suit that looked like a wrestler's uniform. However, it covered all of her parts, especially her boobs, and was an elastic material that was used for leggings. In addition, Edith was wearing a black beanie with a huge puff ball to match the black elastic suit. Edith did not mind this as much because not only was there color coordination, but she also was feeling comfortable in the clothing that she was wearing. Currently, Edith had a huge bowl of the slime in front of her as people went up and constantly fed her. On the sides, Cody and Margo watched closely as Edith was enjoying her pig out session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edith, how's it going?\" The announcer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More slime!\" Edith yelled between bites as her frame was becoming even bigger during her mouthfuls of slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Edith sure likes to eat that slime. And fast,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she never really stops, but it makes me happy if she is happy,\" Cody said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you ever tried the slime?\" Margo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. If I did that, I would probably end up her size. I don't know what it tastes like, but all I can say is that it has seemed really addictive to anyone who eats it,\" Cody said wirh assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo kept on watching as her sister was eating much of the slime with ease. The one curiosity she had was how much her mammoth of a sister now weighed. It was something she would have to check out when they were done. That, and she was wondering where her younger sister was at now. </span></div></div>",

Eating was not a bad thing, but eating against your will was not fun either. However, after the first few gulps, Agnes started to have a change of heart. The slime ultimately tasted like candy, one of Agnes's biggest weaknesses. Instead of having a look of terror on her face, she began to have a look of pleasure on her face. Immediately, Vector could hear Agnes begin to suck down the slime so hard that she was actually going faster than the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would warm up to the slime. Don't worry, I have a lot more where that came from,\" Vector said with a smile as he began to speed up the slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Agnes kept on sucking down the slime faster. The young girl could not resist the taste of what she would now consider a delicacy. Although the young girl was caught up in the slime, she was not caught up on the changes her body was undergoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Agnes's stomach was filling up so fast, the fat on her body was building up instantly. Her thighs immediately began to touch one another as the volume increased. Agnes's belly that once had a tiny bit of fat was now swelling her up into a ball. Her shape was becoming more rotund as the rest of her body kept filling her up like a little ball. Agnes's trousers were starting to look tight on her body as her cheeks began to swell up from being fattened. Even her neck was starting to show the results of the stuffing.

At that moment she suddenly noticed that she was fat and getting fatter. It was a dilemma for the young girl. She wanted this slime so bad but she would get fat. She did't wanted to get fat but at the other hand she did't want to stop eating. But she did't had much choice so she kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like the slime I see.

With slime,\" Agnes said slowly from being so stuffed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want more?\" Vector asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her head, Agnes knew that no was the answer to go with. She didn't want to submit to Vector's evil plan whatever it may be. She knew that with her saying yes, she would be fueling the addiction that he inspired from his creation. However, although the newly fat little girl did not want it to happen, she felt like she didn't want the slime, but needed it. There was no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, YES!\" Agnes yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Vector turned the machine back on and began to feed the fat little girl some more.

Although fattening it may be, she couldn't deny that it was the best thing she tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while we are doing that, I can get you changed into something else in case someone comes around and tries to find you,\" Vector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he pressed a button on the machine nearby that was green. Immediately, as Agnes was still eating, Robot arms came in to change Agnes out of her torn dungarees. Instead, it changed her into Vector's orange stretch suit that helped the little girl get fatter without Vector seeing her private areas.

As soon as the sandwiches were done, Margo had to think first if the sandwiches tastes as super-delicious as they look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Margo. You can do this. Think about how tasty it is. You can just do it!\" Margo said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo took the first bite of the sandwich. And to her surprise, it tasted even better than she thought. Margo was starting to eat the sandwiches like a hungry girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! They are just soooo delicious!\" Margo said with a pleasant reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped down sandwich after sandwich after sandwich. Admiring the taste of the cheese. Margo has become an overeater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the sandwiches were done, there was absolutely no doubt that Margo have gotten even bigger than she was before. Her chin did grow which makes her double chin more noticeable. Her butt grew larger which was surprising. And of course, her belly did also get bigger, which leaves it a little more exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Margo got up from the chair, Margo suddenly saw that she wasn't that short anymore. She has not only grown fatter, but she has also grown taller. Margo was now tall as a normal preteen. She did acknowledge her height growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now I know. The more fatter I got, the more taller I got. Same thing happened with Edith. Except that she went immobile in the end.\" Margo said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Margo do now?</span></div></div>",

It took her a little longer consider that she was now a little bigger, making it harder to move around. She even started to sweat a little bit, but quickly brushed it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I am not immobile yet,\" Margo said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went into the bathroom, began to take off her clothes, and tried to get the ballet dress on. The dress was actually in two pieces, top and bottom. She first tried to put on the top part. As soon as she put it over her head, she had trouble getting it over her belly. Her boobs were even bigger, making it harder to squeeze into. Her belly wasn't even covered one bit by the top since it was so big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she then put on the bottom half, which was not as bad. It was more stretchy than the top portion, but it was still a tight squeeze. Overall, she looked like she was way too big for the outfit. If she even tried to press her belly out, everything would rip off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try and do that,\" Margo said as she felt a weird sensation that she wanted to get even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo had a wicked idea.</span></div></div>",

Margo had to stand up while eating it since she was too big. As she started to chow down those tasty sandwiches while dressed in her ballet dress, Margo's body began to grow slowly and comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly her ballet dress started to tear off in some rips. Since her belly has grown in a noticeable way, her dress was split in half. The upper part covering her big kiddie breasts which were way smaller than a normal woman's breasts. When Margo was thin, her breasts was never that noticeable since she was still young, but now that Margo has grown since her overeating, her breasts was bigger than on a normal young girl. And the lower part covering her butt. The lower ballet dress part looked more like strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being bigger now, she can still walk and it looks like that Margo is still not immobile yet. Her height has grown. Now she is as tall as Gru, if not taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's obvious that i have grown now.\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Agnes would join me for my weight gain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do now?</span></div></div>",

Ever since the three girls came in his life he really got feelings for all three of them.After he got the moon back in the air he was known like a hero. Not really what he wanted to be but he was it now. Now he was a father with his three girls. <br>\r\nMargo with her glasses. She was really smart and always got best grades at school. <br>\r\nAgnes was really sweet. She was what the word cute mend. She really showed that.<br>\r\nAnd Edith. She had a strange bit scary kind of humor. It did remind Gru a bit of himself when he was little. He liked that about her. Not that he loved her more or less then the others.<br>\r\nBut Gru never really learned much about cooking. Sure they had normal dinner with him but the rest of the day all that ate was candy. But the young girls loved candy (especially Agnes) so they did't really mind.<br>\r\nGru always made some free time for them and further they always liked it to play with the MINIONS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy we found the perfect father,\" Agnes mumbled with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we did. Well after he first send us back to the orphan home and into that scary box,\" Margo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was't him. Besides thanks to that we found out he cared about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we're out that orphan home. I hated that box,\" Agnes sad while she shivered and pushed a fist full of candy in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're gone now. All three together and adopted by the same nice man,\" Margo said chewing on some smaller candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me no one would ever adopt me,\" Edith said while she threw some candy in her mouth and pulled the front of her hat down so you could't see her eye brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lived for about a few days now after the moon returned on candy except for dinner. There was starting to grow a nice layer of fat on every girl. It was't too noticeable yet. But they surely gained by all the sugar in the candy.<br>\r\nAll three looked up when they heard Gru run Down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i overslept. Why did't you woke me up? I need to take you to school,\" Gru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't. It's Saturday,\" Edith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there no school at Saturday?\" Gru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not since a few years,\" Margo said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgnes emptied her bowl of candy in her moth chewed it a few times and ran at Gru to hug him like every morning.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"I love you daddy,\" Agnes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargo and Edith also walked too him and hugged him.

She raised her arms up and let out her morning yawn and stretch. After that and rubbing her eyes, she started to move her legs to the side of her bed. Slowly, she rose out of her bed and stood on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was ten years old. She was still very young, but she was more intelligent. She walked over to her mirror and looked at herself. Lucy was wearing pink pajamas with long sleeves. She was very skinny throughout her whole body as shown by the form of her pajamas. She had long, glowing red hair with freckles across her face. She was very lucky that she didn't have glasses or braces since it enhanced her natural beauty. She felt like she was a very lucky girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was November and winter time, which meant that Christmas would be coming in the next month. Lucy's half brother, Charlie, had a father that she called Uncle Scott. What many people didn't realize was that he was Santa Clause. He spent his days in the North Pole preparing for Christmas. For Lucy, this was a pretty cool thing, especially since her and Uncle Scott were very close. They were so close, Uncle Scott was letting Lucy stay with him for a little while and have her live in the North Pole. Lucy was very excited for this as she had always wanted to do this. Her parents debated letting her do this, but they trusted Uncle Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Lucy began to think about this, she remembered that she was leaving in a few hours. She immediately opened up her closet and started to pack for her long trip. As she was doing so, excitement filled her mind as she was getting closer and closer to staying up in the North Pole. </span></div></div>",

Here's your breakfast!\" Lucy's Mom said as she brought a stack of flapjacks to Lucy. Lucy licked her lips and immediately digged into her breakfast. She loved the taste of the fluffy flapjack in her mouth mixed with delicious syrup. Lucy was lost in the bliss of the flapjacks until finally, her fork was reaching for an empty plate. She had eaten all of the flapjacks. She patted her stomach as she realized how full she was, although none of it really showed on her body. Suddenly, the door bell rang as Lucy's Mom opened the front door. A few minutes later, her Uncle Scott entered in normal human clothes as he was hiding his real identity.

She helped Lucy put on and zip up her pink puffy jacket. She then got a pink scarf and wrapped it around Lucy's neck. Finally, she grabbed Lucy's pink tassel hat with a huge puff ball on top and pulled it down on her head, making Lucy giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go!\" Uncle Scott told Lucy. With that, Lucy hugged and kissed her Mom goodbye as they all walked out to the sledge.

She then looked next to her to see Uncle Scott controlling the sledge, which made her smile. She could never get over the fact that her Uncle Scott was Santa Clause. She wondered what things they would do at the North Pole. Uncle Scott looked at Lucy and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sleepy head. You alright?\" Uncle Scott asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm fine. How much longer do we got?\" Lucy asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About another half hour. Are you feeling hungry?\" Uncle Scott said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit.

Lucy opened up the compartment in front of her. To her surprise, there was a plate full of a dozen sugar cookies waiting to be devoured. Immediately, Lucy grabbed the plate of cookies and started to eat them with haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, Lucy. There's more where that came from,\" Uncle Scott said.

Lucy was amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town, though small, had a sense of christmas beauty to it. The town had buildings with Christmas colors and were covered with snow. Lucy could see all of the elves walking around the town and looking up at the sledge, which made her smile.

Some were working on assembly lines while others were hammering objects by themselves. But no matter who you looked at, they were all happy with what they were doing. Lucy and Uncle Scott continued to walk through the workshop and up the stairs. They walked down the hall until they approached two big doors that were pink. This made Lucy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you were coming, I took some time and created your own bedroom. I hope you like it,\" Uncle Scott said as he ushered her into the room. They opened up the doors and suddenly, Lucy was grinning the biggest grin from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing! Thank you!\" Lucy screamed to Uncle Scott as she hugged him. And it was. Lucy's room was all pink, which made her happy. She saw that she had a pink water bed that was as big as her parent's bed. She saw that she had couches around her room and furniture that was all pink. There was even jars of candy around her room, which made her happier. She noticed that there was a patio attached to her room that looked out into the North Pole. But the thing that made her smile the most was the fact that she had a walk in closet filled with all different kinds of clothing. For any girl Lucy's age, this was paradise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime. You go ahead and enjoy. I'll be back,\" Uncle Scott said. Lucy complied and ran into her room. She took off her hat, jacket and other outerwear and started to relax. She sat on her bed and felt herself sink into her bed. She checked out some of the items in her furniture pieces like toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, she went into her walk in closet and started to look at some of her clothing. There were many different kinds! Although it was winter up here, there was summer clothing, skirts, leggings, sweaters, swimsuits, and more. But one thing that made her smile was that Uncle Scott made Lucy duplicates of his Santa suit. One of the suits was in pink and one was in red. They came along with Santa hats that had the same color as each suit respectively. Lucy changed herself into black leggings, a pink skirt, a pink and white shirt, and a pink santa hat. She started to pose in her mirror, having fun with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to love it up here,\" Lucy said to herself as she ate some reeses candy out of a jar.</span></div></div>",

I'm still feeling pretty hungry,\" Lucy said as she massaged her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy kept her clothes she was wearing on her and started to walk for the bakery. Luckily for her, the bakery was in the same building she was staying in, especially since there were many buildings with different things in them in the North Pole. After a few minutes of searching, Lucy came up to two glass doors, one door displaying the words \"The Kitchen,\" which enticed Lucy. Immediately, she opened up the doors and looked around. The kitchen was huge with multiple ovens and cooking ranges. Many of the elves were wearing white chef hats and aprons while moving around like crazy. The aroma of baked goods started to move through Lucy's nose, making her lick her lips. As she looked around, she saw a tray of red and green frosted cupcakes sitting on a counter by the door. She ran over to them and started to gorge herself, not caring who was watching. After a minute, one of the elves came over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you like the treats,\" the elf said as Lucy stuck her head up. Her face was covered in frosting while her cheeks were full of food. She returned to reality for the moment as she noticed the elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! I am so sorry! I should've asked before digging in,\" Lucy said as she started to feel guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all, Lucy!

Also, you're the only human up here.

So feel free to eat whatever you want whenever you want,\" Arnold said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Arnold! Nice to meet you, too!\" Lucy replied. With that, Arnold started to walk back to an oven and continued to work. Lucy, on the other hand, continued to gorge herself as she ate the delicious desserts in front of her.

All of the elves continued to work around her, giving her more desserts to satisfy their guest's hunger. This made Lucy very happy. Her immediate reaction to the end of her stuffing was to rub her stomach. As she laid her hand on it, she had noticed something different: Her stomach was now a belly in her lap. It wasn't a huge belly, but it was big enough for Lucy to notice as some of it popped out from under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt her belly, she started to wonder if her bigger belly was a good or bad thing. Society looked upon fat in a bad way, but her bloated belly did feel good or her smaller frame. In addition to that, she didn't have to worry about her weight too much since she wouldn't be around the same people in school for a while. It seemed like no one in the North Pole would really care about her weight gain either. This made Lucy continue to think to herself as she rubbed her belly, burping here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am on vacation. If I get a little bigger, it won't hurt. I can lose it all later if I want to,\" Lucy convinced herself. With that, she stood up, making her belly move as she did so. It was still peaking out from under her shirt, but she didn't mind it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can go change I guess. But what do I want to do now?\" Lucy asked herself. She had a lot of options for things to do. She needed to change first for sure, but then she could do anything. What does she decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Slowly, Lucy got up and walked out of the kitchen, heading for her room to get ready to change into something different. As soon as she entered her room, Lucy headed for her huge closet to see what kind of clothes she should change into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Well at least I have a ton of options,\" Lucy smiled as she looked at all of the clothes in her closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honestly, Lucy was surprised that she had so much clothing. She was only staying there for a little while, which made her wonder why she had all of the clothes. She forgot about the thought and continued to look through her clothes. Suddenly, her eyes immediately turned to the santa suits her Uncle had made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could wear one of these. They look cute, anyway,\" Lucy said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another moment, Lucy grabbed the pink santa suit and started to change into it. As she was changing, she noticed that the suit felt a little tight on her. After a few minutes of tugging and pulling into the suit, Lucy looked at herself in the mirror as she put the pink santa hat on her head. She was wearing the pink suit, the suit being all pink except for the accents, black leather gloves, a black leather belt, black poots, and her pink santa hat. She looked like the daughter of her Uncle, little miss Santa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like this outfit! I look so cute!\" Lucy said as she put her hand on her hip. As she did this, she could feel the small amount of stomach that she had on her, surprised at the small amount of weight she had gained. She continued to notice how the suit was feeling tight on her. But suddenly, as she looked at herself in the mirror, the suit started to grow a tiny bit bigger. Lucy barely noticed the change, but as the tightness of her clothes changed, Lucy noticed that the outfit was getting bigger for her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen?!\" Lucy wondered in a shocked tone. So many things were on her mind, but she knew that she shouldn't worry since she was on vacation. With that, Lucy walked out of her closet and headed to the town square.</span></div></div>",

She could not wait to see what the town square would be like since the last time she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lucy approached the end of a hall, noticing that she was standing in front of a door. Wondering what was behind it, she opened up the door slowly, finding a machine that looked familiar to her. It had a couple of knobs on it with different colors, almost looking like a wacky slot machine. Quickly, Lucy started to remember what the machine was. She realized that it was a machine that was a secret passage to Uncle Scott's snow globe collection that he had. All of the snow globes were magical in their own ways, which enticed Lucy. She also liked the collection since she liked looking at snow globes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at the knobs, realizing there was a secret password. She started to remember the password her Uncle Scott showed her a while ago. Her idea of going to the town square was forgotten as she started to press the knobs until finally, a clicking noise was heard. The room started to revolve around Lucy. Moments later, Lucy opened her eyes to see that she was in a different room with snow, sky, and snow globes that were flying close by in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love this place!\" Lucy said as she grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy started to approach the snow globes, looking into them and seeing what kinds of powers they had. She glanced and saw some snow globes with powers including being able to look at any person in the world, looking into a person's past, seeing what was going on at the North Pole, and others. But at one point, Lucy approached a snow globe she had never seen. She looked to it to see what power it had.</span></div></div>",

I wonder,\" Lucy said as she held the globe tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Lucy decided to try the snow globe. She started to imagine herself with blonde hair as she closed her eyes tight. When she opened her eyes, she looked in a nearby mirror to see her dreams were reality. She had blonde hair just as she had visioned! She couldn't believe what powers this globe had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's different,\" Lucy said as she changed her hair back to normal by closing her eyes and imagining her normal hair color. \"Now, let's try something more challenging,\" Lucy said as she started to wonder what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that Lucy grabbed her belly, realizing what she wanted to do next. She closed her eyes and started to imagine herself as a fat, immobile girl. She imagined her naked, fat, rounded form to see if the globe would really work. She felt a tingling sensation around herself as she started to open her eyes. The next moment had shocked her to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow! I'm so fat!\" Lucy said in a muffled tone. Lucy was so fat, she was naked like she had imagined! Her belly was at least five feet tall and five feet wide with multiple rolls of fat. Her neck was lost in multiple chins that were on top of her huge, perfect breasts. Her thighs and legs were so fat, they constantly touched each other. Her ass was as big as a front of a car. The only thing she had on was her pink santa hat, which made her realize she was bigger than Santa himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do one more thing,\" Lucy said as she closed her eyes with her ample, fat form. Lucy then started to imagine something very difficult to change in to. She got an idea after a few minutes of thought. She started to imagine herself with really short hair, a little bit fatter than she normally was before morphing, hair in different places, and different body parts while wearing a normal santa suit. After a minute of imagining, Lucy opened her eyes again, except seeing a totally different result. She didn't look like herself at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lord,\" Lucy said in a deeper tone. \"I'm a boy!\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at herself in the mirror, noticing herself in a normal Santa outfit as a boy. The one thing she wondered was if she really was a boy. To prove this, she looked down into her pants to see what the diagnosis was. Suddenly, she covered her mouth in shock as she realized her diagnosis was true.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah!

He knew that he needed to get off on something. Finally, after thinking, Lucas had a random thought come to mind. He slowly began to imagine his girl form, Lucy, naked. He began to imagine her starting to fill up with fat all over, mainly affecting her stomach. Her boobs began to grow to bigger sizes while her thighs kept on expanding until they began to rub up against each other. Lucy kept on growing until finally, she was over six hundred pounds of female fat! With a huge breath, Lucy fell on her massive butt and began to breathe hard from her massive growth. All Lucas could think about was how much he was liking his imagination. Finally, he had accomplished what he set out for as he felt an orgasmic feeling spread across his body as he released.

As he looked in the mirror, he noticed how he did look fatter, but the suit fit him well. In all honesty, Lucas kind of looked like a younger version of Uncle Scott, but he was not directly related to him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucy looked at her reflection in some nearby glass. She saw just how different she looked. Her hair was a lot shorter, but her bangs were longer and parted to the side above her eyes. She pulled up the sleeves of her jacket to see that she had hair on her arms, which indicated there was also hair on her legs. She looked at herself in the mirror, noticing herself in a normal Santa outfit as a boy. The one thing she wondered was if she really was a boy. To prove this, she looked down into her pants to see what the diagnosis was. Suddenly, she covered her mouth in shock as she realized her diagnosis was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I am a boy!\" She screamed in her deeper tone. She felt like a different person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think I have seen enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy said as she grabbed the snowball she had before. Quickly, she closed her eyes, imagining herself in her normal form before she tried to even change her appearence. After a few minutes, Lucy opened her eyes to see that she looked exactly like she had when she entered the room. Her suit was pink, her hair was long, and she still had some fat on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to make sure I really am a girl again,\" Lucy said in her normal girl tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy quickly looked down her pants to find that she was definitely a girl again. The whole situation had scared her, but she was lucky she could change back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness. That was scary! Although I did like being super fat. I should try to be that big again,\" Lucy said with an evil grin. She grabbed the snowball, getting ready to transform into an immobile ball of fat. Suddenly, she stopped herself, realizing something. She could make herself fat, but wouldn't it be more fun to gain the old fashioned way? By eating and gorging herself into obesidy? Lucy started to debate the idea to herself. She kept on wondering which route she should take.</span></div></div>",

She figured that because she had the chance to, why not take it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wonder how risky this will be for me and for everyone else,\" Lucy wondered to herself as she kept on thinking about changing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of Lucy's concerns included that she wouldn't be able to walk again, her parents may be very angry with her, and she would most likely never leave the North Pole again. But one of Lucy's biggest concerns was that she could die from being so fat. She heard many stories about people having heart attacks from being so obese. But then again, Lucy was using magic, which could take away that risk. In all honesty, Lucy had no idea what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I should try it and see what happens,\" Lucy decided as she looked at her body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking one last look at her small body, Lucy began to close her eyes. She then started to imagine herself growing bigger and bigger, becoming more and more flabby until she was immobile. Lucy imagined herself naked as her stomach took up most of her body followed by a pair of perfectly fattened boobs. Lucy began to imagine the feeling of having multiple chins with no neck. She imagined her thighs constantly rubbing against one another while her arms felt like pillows on her sides. She imagined this and began to think about her being in her bed just sitting the days away, hoping that imagining that would bring Lucy to her room. Finally, the moment of truth came as Lucy was about to open her eyes. Before she did so, Lucy felt a force strengthen around her as she felt like she was being stretched. As she began to open her eyes, her world around her began to change.</span></div></div>",

She could enjoy the taste of delicious foods while looking at her results along the way. With that, she put the snow ball back and looked at all of the snow balls in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least if I want to do something with magic, I know what room I should go to,\" Lucy said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved all of the magic and mystery at the North Pole that surrounded her. She then started to wonder if her Uncle Scott used this magic at all for his advantage. Of course, he was a busy man since he was Santa Clause, but Lucy wondered if he ever used magic to change anything at all, like things in his life, others lives, or even with the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, these thoughts started to go away when Lucy felt her stomach rumble unbelieveably louder than usual. Surprised was all she was since she had eaten not too long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word! I'm hungry already? What do I do now?\" Lucy said as she started to walk out of the room and into the normal halls of Santa's workshop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to head to the town area where all of the elves were.

She was hoping he would give her more food. After a few minutes, she was back in the kitchen while a lot of the elves were working. Arnold saw her and quickly approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Lucy! What can I help you with?\" Arnold asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Arnold. I was just wondering if I could have some more food,\" Lucy asked, trying to come across as shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Didn't you eat not too long ago?\" Arnold asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

I can make you something,\" Arnold offerered, making Lucy smile with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Is there any way you could make me a big cake? I really like cakes with a filling and a ton of frosting. I think that would satisfy my hunger,\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I can do that for you. It will take me a little bit. I have some cakes ready, but I need to put some fillings in them and then put frosting on them. Is that okay?\" Arnold asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. That's fine. Where do you want me to wait?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will bring the cake to you in your Uncle's dining room. I should be fifteen minutes.

See you shortly,\" Lucy said with a grin as she walked out, swiping a cookie from a counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking some more, Lucy had arrived to her living area right down the hall. The area was where Lucy's and Uncle Scott's rooms were at. In addition, there was a small dining area and Uncle Scott's office.

Lucy simply nodded happily.<br>\r\nA week has almost passed since Lucy arrived at the North Pole, but for her it was as great as the first day. These last days she has been exploring all the places and trying to meet as many people as possible. And everyone was happy about her. How she always showed so much interest on their jobs.<br>\r\n\"Well so you can sit there to see how I work on the sled\" said Tony the mechanic elf while pointing at a bench.<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot Tony\" responded Lucy while offering some candy to him. She already made an habit to use the morning to visit all the magical places in the North Pole. And also made an habit of always carry one candy jar with her during those trips. These jars were really big, so she have never finished one even in one while walking.<br>\r\nOf course, maybe she was already full from breakfast. As Santa's niece, everybody tried their best to keep her happy. So breakfast consisted of the tastiest stuff they had. Towers of pancakes, cupcakes, and cereals from all over the world. Sometimes her uncle would throw in some eggs and bacon to balance, but she was more fond to the sweet stuff.<br>\r\nSo again to balance, her uncle makes her eat a bit the elves lunch. And she responsibly obliges, but after lunch she has free range. At night her dinner tends to consists of ice cream, cakes, cookies, shakes, whatever she can ask from the elves. Not to mention that she could play with every toy that can be made in her room. She was having the time of her life here.<br>\r\nBut as intelligent as she is, she is ignoring something critical.<br>\r\nAfter an hour she said goodbye to Tony and left for her room to wait for her forced lunch. Although she seems to find it more enjoyable each day.<br>\r\nSo she continued to walk and continued to eat candies, not noticing she was more than halfway through the jar.<br>\r\n\"My, this jeans are really uncomfortable\" said Lucy while trying to adjust them, she was excited to try this new jeans on her wardrobe, but had problems with them since the morning. \"Uncle Scott probably got my size wrong\" she said. Lucy haven't noticed that all the sweets and pastries she is eating have already taken toll on her body. And while all these food would make her gain weight on normal circumstances, in the North Pole the cooks use magic to make the food tastier, and the sweets sweeter,by magically using more sugar than normal depending on the food. So the pastries could have from twice, to five times as much sugar as normal food.<br>\r\nDue to this, in just six days, she already gained more than five pounds that, due to her small frame, were already forming an obvious pot belly. Besides that, most of her features were getting a little rounder.<br>\r\nBut Lucy was unable to notice these thing, and it doesn't seem she is slowing down her consumption. </span></div></div>",

Now things were going to change because of this rags to riches lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie got himself out of bed and looked at himself in the mirror. He was wearing a pair of pajamas pants with no shirt on. He noted that he was still very skinny, almost skin and bones. He quickly started to change into a pair of jeans and a red shirt so he could find Willy and start learning the tricks to running the factory. Charlie slowly crept downstairs as the rest of his family was sleeping and relaxing in their beds. As Charlie looked at all of them, he slowly opened the front door and crept outside. At this point, he was looking out into the candy fields around him. This was the part of the factory with a chocolate waterfall, candy trees, and even edible grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is still like a dream to me,\" Charlie said as he looked on in amazement. He even noticed that there were some Oompa-Loompas nearby as they were working on harvesting some of the candy trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should I even begin?\" Charlie asked himself.

You will have it until the sugar keeps you up for days and you can't stomach anything else,\" Willy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a lot of chocolate,\" commented Charlie, barely able to fathom how much chocolate eating that would mean, though he was certain he was way behind how much chocolate a boy his age should have eaten by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even more than that,\" answered Willy. \"Now there's a set of buttons on that table.

Charlie had never tasted a chocolate this good in his lifetime. Quickly, Charlie ate through the first chocolate star. He continued to eat and then pick out another chocolate, getting to the point where he began not to notice how fast he was eating the chocolate. At one point, Charlie reached into the bowl, realizing that there were no chocolates left. Surprised, Charlie looked down into the bowl to see the bottom reflecting his face, which had chocolate smeared all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I got to eat the huge chocolate bar. Oh man,\" Charlie gasped as he slowly started to unwrap the chocolate bar that was so huge, it was at least a third of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of trying to hold the chocolate to his mouth, Charlie began to tear off pieces of chocolate and shoved them in his mouth. Again, the taste was very satisfying and fulfilling. He was immediately hooked as he continued to eat the chocolate like a mindless zombie. Bite after bite, Charlie could feel his stomach begin to become more and more full. It at least took him an hour to finish the chocolate. When he shoved the last bite into his mouth, he began to feel how full he really was as he grabbed his stomach in agony. Charlie began to moan in pain from eating so much chocolate. All of the chocolate was smeared all over his hands, face, and on his white shirt. To top that off, Charlie had noticed something different about his pale figure overall.</span></div></div>",

Normally, he was so thin, his ribs were as clear as day. But now, there was only the slightest indication. To some, gaining such weight would have been bad. But Charlie saw it as a sign that his life was becoming all he could ever want it to be. He was lost in thoughts of it for a moment before he felt a surge coming up from his gut. He thought it was a burp, but gas didn't escape past his lips. A firework that soared in the air for a bit before popping in a dazzing display of color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it wouldn't be the Fourth of July without fireworks,\" commented Charlie, admiring Mr. Wonka never ceasing to amaze genius.

Immediately, a tray of marshmallows appeared in front of him. The one problem was that the marshmallows were not any normal kind of marshmallows. They were so huge and coated in a layer of chocolate. The size of the marshmallows were so big, they were at least the size of a basketball. On the plate, there were only two, but that was enough for Charlie at the moment. Seeing the task at hand, Charlie grabbed a marshmallow and began to dig into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's the best marshmallow I've ever had!\" Charlie screamed, having such a momentous sugar rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few more bites, Charlie began to see the white middle of the marshmallow. He also began to feel the white fluff smearing on his face. Although he couldn't see it, there was a bunch of marshmallow residue on his face. Charlie was really beginning to look like a pig. All in all, he didn't care how he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Charlie was finished with the first marshmallow as he gripped his stomach in relief. Looking at the other marshmallow, Charlie started to feel hungry again. In all honesty, he had no idea what was coming over him. Usually, Charlie had lived in poverty and didn't feel like he needed food. Now, he felt like all he wanted to think about was food. With that, Charlie tried to shove as much as he could into his mouth, making his cheeks puff out and his taste buds soar in heaven. Charlie didn't realize how much weight he was beginning to put on just from a little while of eating.</span></div></div>",

He knew all too well that he had full access to the place and that there was no restriction when he wanted to do something. At that moment, he wanted to do more testing. He wasn't worried at the small layer of fat he had gained as it made his pajamas fit better and pushed him more to a normal weight for a boy his age. Making up his mind, he slipped out of bed and headed back to the testing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he expected, it was still active and ready for him to do more tests.

The siblings have been playing multiple rounds of this game for their own entertainment in the huge mansion they were living in. Quickly, Susan found a hiding place in a closet in her room. Lucy, being as small as she was, found a hiding place under her own bed. Edmund, however, was having more difficulty finding a good place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should I hide?\" Edmund asked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept on looking around in rooms, but found that he was ending up in the two same rooms as Lucy and Susan, which would make him be found much faster. Finally, Edmund came upon an unfamiliar door. He quickly opened up the door, got inside, and shut it. Edmund began to look around, but immediately became shocked. All that was in the room was a wardrobe that was twice his height. Edmund became mysterious about why there was just a wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here I come!\" Peter screamed out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waisting any time, Edmund rushed to the wardrobe, opened the door, ran in, and closed the door behind him. As he looked through the key hole of the wardrobe, he saw a view of the room on the outside. Afraid of being found, Edward began to back up into the wardrobe, feeling the wood floor. This kept on happening until suddenly, Edward started to hear a crunch. He began to look down to the floor, noticing a odd change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snow?\" Edward asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Edward looked behind him, noticing a huge difference that made his mouth open wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" Edmund yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward was gazing upon a whole bunch of land covered in snow. Multiple pine trees were in the area covered with heavy snow fall. All that was in Edward's view was a lamp post and a wooden bench. Edward had no idea how he had gotten into this world, but he was feeling curious, wanting to look around to see what he could find.</span></div></div>",

Quickly, Edward went back to the wardrobe to look for some warm, comfortable clothes to wear. Unfortunately, all that was there were some fur coats and other outdoor wear. He then made a decision on what to grab. Edward grabbed himself a grey fur coat, a pair of fur gloves to match, and a grey beanie hat with a ball on top of it. Edward then looked up at the light post and saw the reflection of himself in the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Well, this will have to do for right now. It's not like there's anything else there,\" Edward said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was ready, Edward walked fifty feet away from the wardrobe area until he was out in an open area. All around him were trees, but the open area seemed to be like a road for sledges or whatever was used in this area. Edward kept on wondering how there was such a world like this on another side of a wardrobe. Edward was not one to believe in magic. That was more his younger sister, Lucy. But at this rate, Edward wouldn't deny that this trick was from magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way do I go?\" Edward asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor miles, it seemed like all that was in front of him was snow, which made him want to go back to the wardrobe.

The White Witch intended to fatten the boy to immobility, ensuring he would be helpless. <br>\r\n  So far, Edmund had put on a good 40 pounds, and it showed. His once thin body had rounded out a bit. He had a double chin, and rounding cheeks. It was his upper body that changed the most. His top was stretched tight over the bulge of his stomach. Boy bosoms could be seen, as well as soft love handles. The buttons of his top were gapping.

It had a table for a base, then some springs and gears. With them was the Witch. She motioned for it to be placed next to the bed. <br>\r\n  \"I have decided to weigh the boy. This way I can keep track of his progress easier.\" The servant dwarf dare not say anything. <br>\r\n   All the dwarfs pitched in. It was needed. Edmund was rapidly gaining weight. Carefully they slid him over onto the table. He didn't resist. He was at the point where all he cared about was being fed. He wanted to get whatever this was done so he could get back to it.<br>\r\n   One of the dwarfs released a lever on the device, which made the table sink down, relying on the springs for support. He then looked at a scale.<br>\r\n  \"300, your Majesty.\" he said.<br>\r\n    This of course, meant Edmund weighed 300 lbs. The Witch mused on this. She estimated he had gained 165 lbs. since his time here. This on a 12 year old.<br>\r\n  \"Keep the scales here. He's to be weighed daily until he reaches his goal weight.\"<br>\r\n   \"Of course your Majesty, but excuse me, how much more is he to gain?\"     <br>\r\n  She thought about it.

She wanted him rounder.<br>\r\n  \" The boy is to gain 200 more pounds.\"  <br>\r\n  The dwarfs all looked at each other. <br>\r\n  \" Are you deaf?\" she asked.<br>\r\n      \"No, your Majesty\" said one of the dwarfs. \"It's just that the boy cannot be a threat to you now, he's...\"<br>\r\n  He never got a chance to finish.

As the sledge came to a stop, she noticed who and what was in the sledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sledge was as white as the winter snow, some parts of the sledge looking crystalline. It was being pulled by a white reindeer the size of a moose. Behind him on the whip was a little elf shorter than four feet from what Lucy assumed.

Powers of good wonder that could help anyone with anything.... like you,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well.... what can you do?\" Lucy asked the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like this,\" The White Witch said as she waved her wand. Crystalline shot from her wand like water flowing out of a faucet. Suddenly, a box formed in her hand. As soon as the box was created, the White Witch opened up the box to reveal the special item: A never ending supply of Turkish delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Take one!\" The White Witch uttered. Lucy thought that the Turkish delight looked appetizing. She decided to...</span></div></div>",

She looked one more time at the White Witch. She did say she was a good witch. Besides, what harm could there be in just eat some Turkish delight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Take one!\" The White Witch repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You're a good witch after all, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! Look at me. I'm The White Witch! White is the color of good and friendly. Black is the color of evil, death and pain. You must have heard about white and black magic. Now, what kind of magic do you think a white witch would use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy must admit it did make sense. Her parents and Peter sometimes read her fairy tale stories. Sometimes, the stories included mean witches, but they always wore dark, dirty clothes. Of course, they used black magic. It all did make sense to Lucy, which made her forget her doubts. Her little hand reached in the box and she took a piece of Turkish delight. Slowly, she put the piece into her mouth. The moment she tasted it, she didn't know what happened. It tasted fantastic! It was the best Turkish delight ever! It was better than any Turkish delight she ever tasted before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" The White Witch asked with a devilish grin that Lucy did not notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fantastic! It tastes delicious! Where did you buy those? I must really ask my mom to buy some of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry dear, but I didn't buy those. I made them with... magic,\" She whispered the last word into Lucy's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ice, cold breath circled in Lucy's neck, causing goosebumps over her entire body. But still, Lucy still thought she was with a good witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it was a nice view, like a winter wonderland. She liked the winter. You could sledge riding, ski, and of course, there was Christmas. She remembered those mornings when she and her siblings opened their presents while there was a nice fire burning in the fireplace together with her parents.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take some more! Take as many as you like!\" The White Witch said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy didn't need to be told twice. The Turkish delight tasted so good, telling her to take as many as she would like was the same like when she would have said take the whole box. Lucy normally wasn't that greedy, but this Turkish delight was so good, she couldn't stop eating it. The only thing in her mind was to eat as much of the Turkish delight as possible. For a moment, she forgot all things around and about her. The White Witch, the winter wonderland, the sledge, even her siblings..... Until her hand touched the bottom of the now empty box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Did I eat them all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I like girls with a healthy appetite. Most girls these days are way too focused about their weight,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. My sister Susan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SISTER!!!\" The White Witch screamed so loud, the elf almost fell of the sledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" The White Witch said. \"It's just all so new to me. Like I said, I never saw a creature of your type before and believe me, I've been around here a long time. So I was very surprised to finally meet a daughter of Eve. I thought they all vanished years ago, but then suddenly, you showed up and you tell me you have a sister! So, there are two of your kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well me and my sister, Susan. I also have two brothers named Peter and Edmund, but they're boys,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The White Witch slowly asked, not wanting to hear an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl didn't know how much trouble she got herself and her siblings in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy slowly put a hand on her belly and suddenly noticed how her belly seemed a bit bigger. She then remembered how much of the Turkish delights she had eaten. How much of the turkish delights had she eaten? A lot, that was for sure, but enough to make her belly bigger? Sure, it wasn't really big, especially since Lucy was very thin. Sure, she even wasn't chubby yet, but still, her belly was a bit bigger. She didn't think anyone would notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Lucy?\" said The White Witch.         </span></div></div>",

This place looks amazing and I'm glad I have found a friend,\" Lucy said to The White Witch. Although the White Witch is cold, this made her give the girl a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...... Can I have.... some more Turkish delight?\" Lucy asked the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Said The White Witch, who immediately waved her wand and made an even bigger box of Turkish delights appear. Lucy immediately became greedy, digging into the Turkish delight. Like last time, all she could think about was the Turkish delights. It was as if this food had become a part of her, making her forget her siblings, the witch, and everything. All she could think about was the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we are going to go off to my castle, how about I change your clothes?\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked up from her food-induced coma and asked \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is change your color of your clothes. Nothing here is brown, but many things are.... white,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, the White Witch waved her crystal wand toward Lucy. Suddenly, a glow appeared around Lucy that was brighter than the sun. A few seconds later, the bright light dimmed down from around Lucy. She opened her eyes and looked at herself. She looked a little bit different. Her brown jacket was now a white that was as white as the snow around her. Her Peruvian-knitted hat with tassels and pom pom accents was now as white as her fur coat topped off with a white poof ball. Her gloves were now also white. As she looked under her jacket, she looked at her clothes. She was now wearing a white dress that was like the White Witches, but smaller. She could see her new, small, forming belly, but she did not think anything about it. She looked at the floor of the sledge (Which was ice) and noticed that from under her hat, her hair was curly and longer. She even noticed that she had blues eyes. Some changes were minor, but some were a little more than minor. But no matter what, Lucy liked her new look. This look made her look a little older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this looks better,\" The White Witch said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks!\" Lucy said, admiring herself for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lucy, go on and eat!\" The White Witch said in a tone that made Lucy excited. Lucy then licked her lips and started to eat more, making The White Witch smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sledge moved and they all headed off to the White Witch's Castle, The White Witch was thinking of her plan....</span></div></div>",

Lucy is fattening up before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy is fully focused on the Turkish Delights. In fact, her mind is clouding more and more.

Lucy then follows the White Witch and jumps down from the sledge. When she jumps down, her body jiggles a little as her eyes go to her chest and belly. Both have become fatter.

She was too valuable to use for a fun thought of a pig minion, even though she must admit she acted like one. Besides, she needed someone to follow in her footsteps and there was no possible chance she would ever get a child again. In this case, let alone, a girl. Lucy would become the next White Witch or maybe The Fat White Witch instead. But there was another reason why she wanted Lucy. It was told that Aslan would defeat her and the sons of Adam would rule. This would possibly be her brothers. But, she could train Lucy to become an evil witch. She could always use her as hostage if she wanted to. Even if she would die, Lucy would still take her place. She doubted if her brothers would hurt their own sister anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy let out a small girlie burp and tossed away a empty box and rubbed her belly. She was now really chubby, but she didn't really mind it. Her mother always told her she was much too skinny. Besides, the Turkish delight tasted very delicious, but maybe she needed to stop for a while. She was pretty full and her belly was pressing hard against her dress, which was a totally new feeling for the former skinny girl. She was a bit surprised about how big she had gotten, but The White Witch told her it looked good on her. She still trusted The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So daughter of Eve, Do you like it here?\" The White Witch asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's wonderful. It looks so nice and all it seems you've turned all evil people into stone. That means there's no evil here, which is great,\" Lucy said with a chubby grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch smiled, but at the same time, she cursed it that this girl was so darn friendly. She wanted to make Lucy evil. Until now, she only made her fatter. She didn't seem to have changed much in character except with being a bit more greedy, which wasn't anything like Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, daughter of Eve, this can once be all for you,\" The White Witch told Lucy with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me? You mean this whole castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Much more! This whole land of Narnia. I rule Narnia, but I will eventually become old. Sure, thanks to my magic, I could live for centuries maybe, but nothing is for sure. It could also be that I die in just a few years. Maybe I get killed by someone. I never had a heir, but then you showed up. I can train you and make you the next White Witch. What do you think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sounds great, but you just said it could take centuries before you die. I'm lucky if I reach one hundred. I could be dead and buried before you die,\" Lucy said, sort of frowning at the thought.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"But my dear child, I will teach you how to become a Witch. You will also live for centuries and soon, you will find someone who can follow in your footsteps. So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded great, Lucy must admit. She would be able to eat a lot more Turkish delight and all, but without the food, her head got clear and she remembered her parents and siblings. Sure, she could help a lot of people if The White Witch trained her, but she couldn't just go without saying goodbye. Besides, could she miss all things at home? What were the problems she need to solve in her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know for sure, miss. It all sounds wonderful. I must admit that! But I have family, friends, and I grew up on the other side. If I go, I wanna say goodbye to them. I haven't seen much of this world yet. I need to learn more about it. I need some time to think about it,\" Lucy said to The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear, You're a very smart lady,\" The White Witch said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Susan gave up. \"I can see your feet sticking out from under the curtain,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it. That's why I hate hide and seek. You're much too good at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I found Edmund before you... But where's Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's called HIDE and seek.

This was becoming a tiny habit of hers. As she tied them, she noticed how tight the tassels were up against her chin. It was then she realized that she had even more chin than before. By feeling her tassel-tied chin, she could feel that she had a double chin. As the two were talking, the White Witch did not notice Lucy feeling all over her body. Lucy felt her face. Her face was more full as she could tell that she was gaining a pair of chubby cheeks. She felt her belly and noticed that it was starting to curve out like a pregnant belly.

Think good about yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did make sense too Lucy. Slowly she took the mirror from the white witch and looked at her face. One moment she did't knew the girl in the mirror. Then she remembered that she changed a bit. Like her blue eyes. Also her hair that was curly instead of her normal, straight hair. She also noticed the extra weight and liked what it had done to her. It made her small face a bit rounder and more lovely and her body a bit more feminine. She felt a bit older then she was. She really liked this new look.<br>\r\nIf a little weight could make her look so much better...<br>\r\nShe took one look at the box and grabbed it and started to stuff herself. Pushing her mouth full with the charmed, turkish delight. <br>\r\nThe White Witch looked with a wide smile how the little girl was eating the food.<br>\r\nLucy didn't understood why she stopped a moment eating this delicious food. But the charm slowly got in her head and in her brains. It found her memories about her family, took them together and curled around it and the next moment, Lucy forget all her memories about her family.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucy shook her head to get clear again.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Daughter of Eve... Do you want to become my heir?\" The White Witch asked again.</span></div></div>",

Her plan had worked. She now had a heir to her throne, she was fattening up Lucy right, and she was becoming a huge friend to Lucy. But to make sure, the White Witch wanted to make sure that Lucy forgot about her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lucy, tell me, do you have any siblings?\" The White Witch asked, trying not to make Lucy confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... I'm not sure,\" Lucy said, taking another bite of the turkish delight. After she did this, she shook her head again, looked at the White Witch and said \"No, I don't have any siblings.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch had a huge smirk across her face. She finally had Lucy under her control. Now that she had her, she could do whatever she wants to do with her. She watched Lucy as she finished her charmed Turkish Delights. Lucy now was downright fat. Her belly was sticking out, like a big lump coming out of her jacket. Even her boobs were more defined, laying on Lucy's belly. All of her clothes looked tighter as she was filling out more and more. Her thighs were slowly starting to rub up against eachother. Her arms were starting to fill with fat, looking a great deal thicker. Even her face was promptly filling out. Her neck was definitely a double chin now, and Lucy was reminded more and more as she tied her hat tassles together. Her cheeks made her look like she had a chipmunk's face. As the White Witch saw this, she wondered what she should do next for Lucy. She decided to...</span></div></div>",

First crawl, then walk, then run. You need to start with something easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it hard to make turkish delight?\" Lucy asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for me. But I've been her for century's. My power is huge. Then making turkish delight is a a piece of cake. But this is your first lesson. Making turkish delight is to hard for you. For now. How harder you do your best to learn the faster we can do harder stuff like making turkish delight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'm ready. Teach me. I always wanted to learn magic to help people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch grinned friendly with perfect white teeth but inside she hated what Lucy said.

Like mice, wolf's, foxes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the elf's! It would't mind doing something nice for us once in a time!\" One of her minions mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with something easy. Make things float. Everything has a weight. Every object, every animal and every human and you gained a lot of that.\" She said with a sweet giggle. \"How heavier something is how harder it is to make it float. Your mind is one of the most powerful things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mind? How is that going to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a small rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. Seeing is believing. Now turn it around. Believing is seeing. Things touch the ground because of two things. Weight and gravity. Without gravity everything would float. but very light things like a feather can easily float a bit through the air. If something has no weight it will float no matter how much gravity there is. Now all you have to do is believe the rock has no weight. Believe in it with all your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at the rock ad tried to image it was weightless. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not doing your best. Possible because a part of you still think it has weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Lucy yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the rock. Still nothing happened. Lucy looked more deeply started to believe it with her whole mind. The stone slowly started to move. Like if the ground was lightly shaking. The next moment it flew up in the air and started hanging there for about ten seconds. Then it fell back on the ground. Lucy breathed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific Lucy. A natural talent. I guess you're a bit tired. Don't worry we will practice this and before you know it you would be able to do this without any problem. Now i think it's better if you take a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to the elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this little girl to her room! Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf got up and took Lucy by the hand ad took her further into the castle.<br>\r\nThe queen looked at another elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's perfect to be my heir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? She's fat. She'll become much fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I wanted to do that. It's easier that way. Easier to make her my heir and she'll be harder to take away if her siblings might come for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but do you really wanna make her your heir. My queen she's nice and friendly and i think she really wanna help all other creature's out of Narnia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see how fast that rock moved?\" She has a great power.

All of her furniture was made out of ice, but you couldn't see anything behind the furniture ice. Even her bed had the ice look to it, but suprisingly, her bed was not made of ice. It was the softest material that she had ever slept on, giving her the feeling of the best sleep ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was still groggy from her magic lesson, she decided to get herself out of bed to look around her room more. She slowly got herself up, the fat making it harder for her to get up. She couldn't believe how fat she had become. But suprisingly, she loved it. She even loved her new outfit. She loved her hat, her fur jacket, her shoes, and most of all, she loved her fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around the room, noticing something amazing: There were boxes and boxes of turkish delights around the room! Lucy couldn't even count how many boxes there were, but she didn't care since all she cared about was the food! She immediately grabbed a box and began digging in.

But that was not the only thing. It also made sure that she wanted to become The White Witch heir more then before. Soon Lucy consumed so many of the turkish delight she could't remember a single thing about her past until she became in Narnia. But Lucy did't cared. She got very sleepy and walked over to her bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need some sleep. All that magic made me tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast she undressed herself. Then she noticed herself in the mirror. I was a high mirror about seven feet high so she could see her whole body in it. She always wanted to have such a mirror (and if she would have remembered Susan also) too look at her outfits. The mirror was also very wide but Lucy was thankful for that or else she would't be able to see her entire body. She looked at her body. <br>\r\nWithout her dress her extra weight was even more noticeable. Her flat belly she used to be proud of was't anywhere near flat now. It was bulging out forward and was now a nice potbelly that hung down covering Lucy's private parts. But her belly was't the only thing that was bigger. Her thighs were so fat they were rubbing together when she walked. Also her butt was big and round and also her upper arms were getting bigger. Her cheeks were puffy and pink and bowl and looked nice in her face. She smiled with teeth as white if snow and played a bit with her hair. <br>\r\nShe never really cared so much about her looks but was very happy with the changes. All the extra weight made her look more feminine. Also a bit older. She liked her new body and loved her fat. She grabeed her hat and put it back on and crawled in her bed, naked, only wearing her hat. It felt so good. It did't took long for her to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have that little girl eating out of my hand. She was easy to fool.\" The White Witch mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. It seemed more like you really have feelings for that little girl. Like you really love her.\" The elf mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand of The White Witch moved fast and grabbed the elf around his throat while she brought him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen carefully. I'm The White Witch. I've killed worlds. This little girl is more someone who can take over after me she can hurt everyone who survived. So that even if i die... I can still hurt the people that survived. Not even Aslan would kill that little Lucy. So don't think i have feelings. Capice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf was starting to turn purple and shew threw him too the wall. He hit it pretty hard and slid down and kept lying there. <br>\r\nThe White Witch looked out of her window. Sure she had Lucy but she said she had siblings. Maybe she did't remember them but that did't want to say they were't there. If they would come her power was in danger. But now she had Lucy as her heir she worried less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So finally a daughter of Eve is here. I guess soon some sons of Adam will come too. Now what do i need to do with them. I must be careful. I'm afraid they won't be as easy to fool as their sister.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other elf who took Lucy to her room returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she?\" The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's asleep. After consuming more turkish delight. She fat my queen and if she keeps eating like this i won't take long before well... before she becomes really fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my plan. She likes her fat so she probably get's very greedy and when she get's greedy she will probably think only of herself. Besides... if someone hears there's a daughter of Eve here they might try to rescue her. Do you know how hard it is too move such a huge girl. Besides how fatter she is how less chance i get she goes outside on her own and finds out I'm not so nice as i made her think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sounds like a good plan. But still she is't evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll work on that. You don't have to worry about that. I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Lucy you won. I give up!\" Peter yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were is she?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's in another part of the house and can't hear you.\" Edmund tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you look in that wardrobe?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i did't. Maybe she hides behind some coats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three kids walked over too the wardrobe. Peter stepped in and felt with his hand if he could feel his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy! Are you in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Edmund also tried to get in. Peter got a push and expected to hit the back of the wardrobe. When that did't happened he looked around and could't believe his eyes. He did one step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan. Edmund you gotta see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe followed him and no one of the three could say a word while they looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

If she learned more magic, she could do more things. If she ate, she could stay in bed naked (wither her hat only) since she felt comfortable in bed naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Witch's point of view, Lucy could either learn more magic to make her more evil or she could let Lucy eat more charmed turkish delights to make Lucy more evil.

Why not a box of turkish delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it again? Gravity and weight. If something has weight gravity pulled it down and if something does't have weight it wont fall down so it can float. What you see is what you believe now turn it around. So believe the box of turkish delight is weightless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated and soon a box flew over too her. It was far more easier then the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was very easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's normal sweet hart. You never used magic before. First you need get it out you. It's like opening a jar. First time it's hard to open. but after that it's easy. Every kind of magic you learn would be difficult the first time but after that the first time you can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Lucy's clothes and snapped her fingers and pointed at them.

She stuffed her cheeks so full of turkish delight she looked like a chipmunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you teach me that too, and teach me how too make turkish delight.\" She asked with full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the time is right.

It's harder to make things appear out of thin air.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I understand.

She sat her butt down onto the throne, realizing that her butt was beginning to flow off of the throne. This led her to another evil smile. The White Witch noticed this and also let out a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I will fix that,\" The White Witch said, waving her wand once more. Suddenly, Lucy's icy throne became bigger. The throne was now very wide, leaving her butt two more feet of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you make my throne so wide?\" Lucy asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger for when you become immobile... if that is what you want,\" The White Witch said with a grin of delight. Lucy was happy to hear this. She now wondered what she wanted to do next....</span></div></div>",

So will you after me. When the time is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was thinking I hardly know anything about this world. If I'm gonna rule it once I wanna learn more about it. I wanna travel around Narnia. While we're doing that I would like to eat some turkish delight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You just stay here.\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the hall and called an elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it what you want White Witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and The Fat White Witch wanna travel around Narnia. So go prepare the sledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh excuse me but I'm not sure the sledge is strong enough to hold... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE IT CAN! I MADE IT WITH MAGIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good but I'm not sure the reindeer can pull her extra weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get some more of those stupid animals to pull the sledge! Now go! It's so hard those days to get some good servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back into the throne room. Lucy was still munching on turkish delight. She stopped one moment to feel her belly and suddenly she remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I once heard that being fat is unhealthy.\" Lucy said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother once told her this and Susan too. Lucy did't remember her mother or Susan but she remembered that she once heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear. Maybe if you get fat from normal food it's unhealthy but the turkish delight is made with magic and it might make you fat but it won't make you unhealthy. No matter how fat you get from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cheered Lucy up. She waited patient until the elf came with the news that the sledge was ready. She noticed it was getting harder for her to stand up. Also walking took a bit more effort then it had been before but Lucy did't mind it too much. If it  would become a problem The White Witch would help her and she would soon learn some magic herself to help her and she would have enough servants to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take place.\" An elf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment.\" The White witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam hit the sledge and made it bigger. The White Witch grinned.<br>\r\nBoth got on the sledge. An Elf climbed to the front of the sledge to lead the reindeer's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do The White Witches like to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except from that place were I met you I have't seen anything. I guess every way is fine. But i would like it to see some of the animals that live here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her. Let's go to the forest. A lot of animals live there. just like some trees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do trees live. I know they grow and get leafs and all but the don't really can do much more.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh yes they can do much more. But maybe just not in your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i have so much to learn. I don't even know what kind of different animals live here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you will learn it all.

There was some sun but not much since it was winter year-round because of the witch. The White Witch looked down at Lucy, who had a sparkle in her eye as she munched on her turkish delights and looked out into her future land. The White Witch smiled since Lucy was satisfied with what she was seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy was happy with everything she was seeing. She saw a couple of trees move and heard and echo in the woods as the sledge was traveling through the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the trees talking?\" Lucy asked the White Witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes. You see, the trees try not to stick out. They can be very shy. They try not to reveal what tree is talking, which makes them very unique,\" The White Witch said to Lucy, giving her a smile of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Lucy said, continuing to look around as she ate her turkish delights. She saw some minotaurs walking away from the sledge as they traveled out of the woods. She even saw some talking white squirrels that flew from tree to tree. As they continued to travel out of the forest, Lucy looked in the distance to see a mountain. It was as tall as mount everest, making Lucy stare in awe. There was so much snow, she wanted to jump into it and make snow angels and frolic in the snow. But at the moment, she was very attached to her fat and food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the turkish delights was gone, Lucy looked at the White Witch. The White Witch told her assistant to stop the sledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you play in the snow for a few minutes while I talk to my assistant?\" The White Witch suggested to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Lucy said, agreeing with the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy waddled out of the sledge and plopped herself into the snow on her back. She began to move her fat arms and legs around in he snow, making a fat snow angel. The White Witch watched Lucy in awe as Lucy was happy with herself at the moment. The White Witch noticed that Lucy's bare belly was sticking out of her jacket somehow. It was so much bigger, the White Witch started to gape her mouth in awe at the sight of Lucy's huge belly. She looked at her from top to bottom. Lucy was still wearing her tassle hat, her cotton ball on the top of her head digging into the snow as she moved. She now had multiple chins that were becoming bigger and prominent as she ate. Her thighs were always rubbing up against eachother while her mammoth arms were double in their normal size. The White Witch was happy that Lucy was under her control more and more every moment. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was a bigger then a normal fox and was standing on his behind legs. He looked questioningly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Who are you?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a fox.

Who is that Aslan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch needed to do her best keep smiling. But telling her Alan was coming was the worst news she could have heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is that fox now sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He suddenly ran away. He seemed pretty nervous. Like he was scared or worried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah how strange,\" She said while her knuckles that hold her wand turned white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to stay calm. So Aslan was coming? Should she be worried? No, why should she be worried? She had Lucy! Lucy would even eat out of her hand and she knew Lucy was very important in the battle. As long as Lucy was in her power, what could they do? Take her away? Well they'd first need to get able to lift her. That should be a very strong creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lucy, it seemed you already outgrew those old clothes already!\" The White Witch said while she pushed a finger in Lucy's belly that was sticking out of her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gaining really fast! Right?\" Lucy said excited    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy walked back to where she saw that fox. She didn't see anyone. Suddenly, she bent far over and grabbed a hand full of snow. She pushed it together and made a nice snow ball and hit the elf right in the face. He was so surprised he took a few steps back and fell of the sledge. Lucy and The White Witch both started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny my young mistress. A snowball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really funny!\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never answered my question,\" Lucy noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which question do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aslan?

Maybe we should meet him some day and see who he is!\" Lucy said in an excited tone.

And at that point, your power could be as strong as mine!\" The White Witch said to Lucy, giving Lucy an evil grin. As Lucy saw this grin, she let out a smile and a chuckle. Her chuckling was obvious to the White Witch. As Lucy chuckled, her belly moved inward and outward, letting Lucy's belly spill out even more from her jacket. This made the White Witch smile, happy that Lucy loved her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love being fat,\" Lucy randomly uttered out as they both rode along in the sledge. The White Witch turned to her and said,\"I can tell my young child. Tell you what? I will not make your clothes bigger until you grow even more bigger! You will be stuffed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a stuffed sausage!\" Lucy said with a grin. She loved hearing this and was happy that the White Witch was letting her get as big as she wanted. Although she forgot about her previous family, she felt more free than she ever had in her life. She could wear anything she wants, eat anything she wants and as much of it as she wants, and actually be a somebody in this new world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to ride along in Narnia, Lucy hearing the chatting of birds and beavers and other mysterious animals in the land. She even did a double take one time when she believed that she saw a horse like figure in the shadows. Although she saw this, she ignored this and continued to look beyond. At some points in time, she would mess around and pull on her hat tassels. She even began to pull on the elf's hair, making The White Witch smile as Lucy was starting to become more evil. Lucy was definitely getting on the elf's nerves, but she didn't care as long as she was entertained. Every minute, it was obvious that Lucy was becoming more fat, more greedy, and a little more evil. As the sledge rode along, The White Witch kept on poofing up Turkish delights for Lucy's pleasure. Lucy would not stop eating as she was in her fattening food ecstasy. No one would be surprised to say that Lucy could reach the 200 pound mark soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sledge was closer to the White Witch's (And the Fat White Witch's) Castle, the White Witch couldn't stop thinking of Aslan and the future situations that had to occur. She began to think that she needed to train Lucy with more spells, but she wondered if she should fatten Lucy More first, make her more greedy and evil, and then teach her magic. As they both Arrived at the castle, they jumped off the sledge. Lucy jumped but fell on her fat rear, laughing and giggling as she got up and waddled into her home.

I know you want to,\" the White Witch said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.

She thought she looked very pretty. The strage thing was.... she was actually attracted to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned herself back around and hopped into her bed. The moment she did this, she felt a breeze and then a couple of things hit her bed. She looked up and realized that some how, the White Witch poofed up more turkish delights for the piggy, fat girl named Lucy. What Lucy did not know was that the treats were charmed even more....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Lucy responded to this positively, grabbing the box and pulling it towards her. As she pulled to first box towards her, she felt her belly bulge out from sitting out, which let her let out a little moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Lucy took a bite of the turkish delight, she felt something about her was different, as the charmed treat was doing the trick.

Her belly was so big, it seemed like she put a beach ball under her dress. Her butt looked like two melons. Her arms were flabbier with her upper arms looking like pillows. Her thighs looked like small tires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, I think I need to teach you more magic. You only had one lesson. I must say I'm a bit disappointed you didn't use the trick yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked suprised for one moment. Then, she remembered she was able to let things float. She totally forgot. She didn't remember the first years of her life, but she knew she never was able to let things float before. It was a bit new for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I forget I was able to let things float.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat White Witch, never forget your lessons. They might save you life once!\" The White Witch said in a tone like a mother who told her child a valuable lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. So are you gonna teach me how to make turkish delight?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be in such a hurry. I already told you all in good time when the time is right for it. It's harder to learn how to make things out of thin air. You will learn that later. First, something less difficult. Don't look so sad. I will make as much turkish delight as you want until you will be able to make it yourself. You don't have to worry,\" The White Witch said, making Lucy happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy must admit she was right. There was always turkish delight around if she wanted any. She must have eaten hundreds by now. The White Witch suddenly saw Lucy's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, how to make things bigger would help. You probably need it right now! It's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up Lucy's jacket that wasn't big enough any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have many sizes, but sizes of living things can change. By growth, weight gain, weight loss, muscle growth, cutting of limbs, or anything else. But the size of objects doesn't change. Why, it's really simple. Look at this jacket. Picture it in your head. Do you have that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy closed her eyes and pictured the jacket as good as it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you know that jacket is there. So you believe in it. Now picture it again, only bigger and believe it's there! Just like you pictured it.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLucy held her eyes tightly closed. Suddenly, a beam of light hit the jacket. It still looked the same, but it was bigger. Lucy smiled and beamed with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural talent. You surely will be doing great things in the future,\" The White Witch said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, an elf came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me if I... \" He started but suddenly he was cut of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason was his clothes shrunk so much, he could barely breath. He ripped off most of his clothes so he could breathe again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's... important... news,\" He said, deeply breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the throne room! I'll be there soon,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Lucy with a pleasant, mean grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do that trick with his clothes?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes. He disturbed us while I was just doing so great, I figured out if I could make clothes bigger, I could also make it smaller the same way. But I needed a test subject. Can I also let living things grow or shrink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dear, but that's totally different. Living things aren't bothered if they grow or shrink. Like I said, they already grow or shrink on their own. But I guess you're tired now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes I am. It's always after our first lessons,\" Lucy said, yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have some good sleep. Come to the throne room when you wake up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy waited until The White Witch left and pulled out her dress and underwear and looked at herself in the mirror with only her hat on. She thought that she looked so hot with her hat and fat, she couldn't stop smiling at herself in the mirror. She trusted The White Witch, but that didn't mean to say she was ready to let her see her naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look so good! I should have gained long ago. Why didn't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her hands slide over her fat body and admired it. She looked at herself from different sides and loved it. She grabbed her love handles and loved them too. Suddenly, she wondered if there would be other fat creatures in Narnia. She didn't liked that idea. She wanted to be the fattest. She needed to ask The White Witch. With that thought in her head, she crawled in bed and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She then looked around her bed. All over her huge bed were giant, empty boxes from the turkish delights. There were at least seven boxes! She had really eaten a lot the previous night. And it showed as she swung her body out of her bed and stood in front of her mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went from fat to downright obese! Her belly was hanging down now as more fat folds were becoming prominant. Her thighs were so big, they were always touching and rubbing together. Her arms looked like they were filled with creme. And her chin was now a triple chin! She was easily 200 pounds. She continued to grab herself, loving the feeling of her fat. She even let out moans of pleasure as she poked her finger deep into her belly fat. She tied her hat tassels together and started posing into the mirror, loving her fat.... and her hat. She didn't know why she loved her hat so much, but she felt it made her unique. And she loved the look of the hat with her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closely observing her fat, Lucy put her clothes on, noticing her clothes were very tight, making her feel like a stuffed sausage.

As she was licking her lips, the White Witch strolled into the room with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" The White Witch asked Lucy, who was happy to see that her face was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks so perfect!\" Lucy yelled with joy, licking her lips faster and faster by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, go on and eat!\" The White Witch said. Soon after, the fat white witch began to dig into the sweets. She didn't even acknowledge the food. She just grabbed anything she could feel like a greedy pig. All she wanted to do was eat..... And that's all she did as she tore through the food that was fattening her up more and more. The White Witch watched in awe as her heir was becoming very greedy by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy was eating, the White Witch watched, thinking in her head. She had received news that Lucy's siblings were in Narnia. She wondered if she should tell Lucy. But before The White Witch could make up her mind.....</span></div></div>",

She got even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want more food!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch waved with her wand and again the table was filled with food and Lucy started to stuff her face again.<br>\r\nThe White Witch decided to don't tell Lucy her siblings were here. After all she could't remember them. But also she wondered what it would do to Lucy if she would see them. She believed she did't had any but if she saw them what could happen?<br>\r\nShe was also worried. Not about the kids. She could always turn them into stone but Aslan was coming. At least that's what the fox said. If Aslan would meet the other kids first that could cause some real troubles.<br>\r\nLucy opened her mouth wide and wolfed a apple pie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUURRRRRRP! Wow that was a good meal.\" Lucy said and slapped her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're done? Again. You must have been really hungry my darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she kept this up it would't take long before she was too fat too walk. Well then she would need some elf's to carry her. After that. Would she fill the entire throne room? Maybe. Who knew? Maybe she would't turn creatures into stone but just eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think i could eat some more.\" Lucy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course here you go dear.\" The White Witch said while she waved with her wand filling the table with food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lucy ate a elf walked over to The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mistress. About that heir of you. You know the rules and the hidden power. Traitor's are for you. For ever betrayal you get blood else Narnia would be destroyed and gone in water and fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't upset yourself. You're right traitors are mine. She's not a traitor. She believed I am a good witch that's why she came with me. That is not a betrayal. She was only gullible. I fattened her up and learned her hoe to do some magic. Where is the betrayal in that? Besides she is't what she used too be anymore. She can't become a traitor anymore since there is't enough left from the old girl to be a traitor. All what left is The Fat White Witch. Especially after that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That food. It was charmed.\" The elf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was. Now leave us alone! Think better at how you're gonna get those kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch walked over too Lucy who cleaned the table for a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess you're full for now.

I need to teach you a few more things before I do that. Right now, I am going to teach you how to change the color of things!\" The White Witch said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is it hard to do?\" Lucy pondered, wondering if it took a lot to change the color of items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not too hard. You seem to be progressing well with your training. So I would not be too worried,\" The White Witch said to Lucy. The White Witch looked around for an object. She stared at the table and saw a plate lying on the table. She picked it up and held it in front of Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Lucy. Look at this plate and picture it in your mind,\" The White Witch said to Lucy. Lucy closed her eyes and tried to imagine the small plate in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... Now what?\" Lucy pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now picture your plate a different color. Picture it something besides white! You can even make it polka- dotted if you want. Just think really hard about it,\" The White Witch said to Lucy. Lucy began to think. She was thinking of the plate being half purple, half blue with a yellow stripe in between. She kept on thinking until suddenly, the White Witch felt the plate rise up out of her hands. A light surrounded it that was very bright. Lucy still had her eyes closed. A few seconds later, the plate lowered back down into the White Witch's hands. She looked at it as Lucy opened up her eyes. The plate was half purple, half blue with yellow down the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, Lucy! You succeeded!\" Said The White Witch, giving Lucy a devilish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did what you said!\" Lucy said, giving a small devilish smile back.

Well The White Witch told her the first time you did some magic it took a lot of effort but after the first time it became more easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sleepy because of all the food I stashed in here.\" She said and shook her belly. \"And because of that magic. I liked it but it always makes me tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the first time dear. It's like opening a bottle or a jar. The first time it's pretty hard to open it but after the first time it's easy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But after I have learned more magic I can do so much things!\" Lucy said excited followed by a yawn. \"I think I need a nap, I'm really tired. Can I go to my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can. I understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy slowly waddled to her room. The White Witch smiled. Lucy was now evil. She need to learn her a bit more magic but who knew. Maybe she could put Lucy in charge of some things. Of course she would still be the real leader of it but it would be a good chance to see how Lucy would act if she was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Is't she anything you could want from a heir from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" The Elf mumbled. \"But that little girl was very annoying when she was pulling at my hair while I was driving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that little girl have her fun. Is there any more news about those other three children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... No not yet but we are looking but we heard some disturbing news from some of the rebels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She asked on a dangerous whispering tone. \"Well what are you waiting? Tell me that disturbing news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they all say Aslan is coming. He should be here soon. A lot of animals and other creatures like centaurs and trees want to join him in a war. I'm afraid he's planning to well eh... defeat you and put those new kids on the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. But the good news is that one of those four children became my heir. So not all is lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Lucy was in her room and like she did any time when she was in her room she pulled of her clothes and started to admire her body in the mirror with only her hat on. Every time she was fatter and every time she was more beautiful. At least in her own eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I love my fat. Why was I thin in the past?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to think. She knew she used to be thin but why. She did't remember a thing. Did someone forced her to stay thin. Who did take care of her? She could't remember it. It was all darkness.<br>\r\nShe lifted her belly let it go and watched it jiggle. She looked in the mirror an noticed another change. Her body became older. Al least she saw some growing lumps on her chest and smiled. She always wondered what it would be to have breasts.<br>\r\nShe lifted her belly as much if she could and kissed it before letting it fell again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you my fat.\"She said an patted her belly while she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have liked it to admire her body some more but was very tired. And next time her body would be even fatter after she digested her huge feast. She crawled under her blanket and fast was in dreamland.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

She laughed and giggled as she put her hat back on her head right. She lifted her fat arms up and stretched as her arm fat was being fully shown. Her arms were super chunky with noticeable fat folds in her under arms. She lifted herself up, making her boobs and stomach jiggle and ripple. She smiled at feeling all of this. After that, she moved her legs towards the end of the bed, which made her feet touch the ground and her fat, naked legs visible. They were at the point that no matter what, her thighs would always touch and rub up against each other. This made Lucy smile even more, making Lucy feel the effect of her chins bunching up together. She stood up out of her bed and waddled over to the mirror to admire herself. She started touching every single part of her body, admiring her fat and her bigger self. She had at least put on twenty more pounds during the night. Lucy was discovering that she was literally in love with her fat as she was attracted to her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want more! I love it! I love it!\" Lucy said, wanting to kiss herself if she could. Maybe the White Witch could teach her a spell for that. Lucy played with the tassels on her white hat and continued feeling her fat. She then got changed, admired her wider self, and waddled out of the room to the throne room. But before Lucy entered, she stopped and listen to the White Witch, who was raving at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get those kids! This is what I want you guys to do. I want you to find those kids, bring them here, and see what we can do! We need to stop Aslan and these children! Now go! Find them!\" The White Witch said to her servant. The little servant fled out of the room, running past Lucy. Lucy then waddled into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my Fat White Witch! Did you sleep well?\" The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very! But what was that about?\" Lucy said, referring to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing to worry about.

His sister, Susan, was wearing a grey fur coat with boots and a grey pair of gloves. From behind the two kids, they could hear their younger brother, Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait up!\" Edmund said, running to his siblings. Edmund was wearing a white fur jacket with a white puff ball hat with tassles (like his sister's clothes) and a white pair of gloves. Since he was smaller than his two older siblings, he kept on trailing behind them. And since there were no more male coats in the wardrobe, Edmund had to take the female white fur coat. All three of the kidshad no idea what to do or where to go. They thought Lucy may be in this world, but none of them were really sure if Lucy was even in this world or at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is magnificent!\" Susan said, smelling te fresh air of Narnia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting hungry!

To be sure, she was busy stuffing her with food so Lucy wouldn't remember anything. Lucy's weight by now wasn't the only thing that increased. Also, her hunger increased and her stomach was very stretched and able to hold way more food. The White Witch was aware of this and fed Lucy, who liked it to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you my fat heir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry! I'm still hungry!\" Lucy mumbled, hardly noticing what The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy closed her eyes and ate whatever came in reach of her lips. She didn't really care about anyone or anything else. The only thing that she cared for was her hunger, getting food and of course The White Witch. She was also very important. Lucy didn't notice anything else except the food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She eats like a cow!\" An elf mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well I think my lovely heir can eat an entire cow and still be hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that girl keeps eating like this, her belly will probably touch the floor soon. What do we do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy! You have to carry her belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to what?\" He asked looking at the huge gut of the little girl. It would be difficult to do that. \"Do I need to carry all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else you get some other elves! I don't care. Just carry that lovely gut of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really care about that girl don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's very important,\" She lowered her voice, \"Especially now Aslan is coming. I need to stop him and can use her with that since he will do anything to rescue her. But he doesn't know she likes it here and is here out of free will. Even if I die, she will take my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hope for our elves,\" The elf mumbled while he walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch looked at him and looked back at Lucy. Lucy was very important for her but she must admit she felt something for Lucy she never felt before except for herself. Why she wondered. She turned hundreds into stone without any regret. She destroyed worlds without mercy and now this little girl hit a tender spot.<br>\r\nShe looked at Lucy's love handles and slowly started to massage them. Lucy was in such a food coma she didn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're getting nice and fat my sweet little piggy!\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, What do I do if those morons don't find those kids? Then they will find Aslan first... Guess then I will have to pay him with a visit and he can also meet my heir.\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at herself and noticed that she was the same size she was at the moment. She sat up in her bed, looking around to see if anything was new. As she stood up, she immediately began to lay flat as someone shoved food into her mouth, making her cheeks puff out and making her chew. She was sondering who this was. After chewing, Lucy sat back up and tried to see who it was. Again, someone shoved more food into her mouth, but she saw who the person was. It was Lucy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lay back and eat,\" Said the Lucy feeding the real one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking more chews of the food and swallowing, Lucy put her hands in front of her and started to ask, \"What is going on? Why are you feeding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is easy,\" The feeding Lucy said to the real one, starting to feed Lucy more and more of the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your conscience. I am feeding you, trying to please you. You know that you want us to get fatter and fatter! You know you love the food, what you wear, and you know that you love yourself!\" Lucy's feeding self was saying to the real Lucy. Real Lucy was enjoying this. After hearing that, all she did was eat and eat, letting the imaginative Lucy stuff her more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want fat! I want myself! I want this all!\" The real Lucy screamed to herself through the bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indulge! Indulge!\" The imaginative Lucy said to the real Lucy. At this point, Lucy was rapidly being stuffed by her conscience as she was getting fatter and fatter. The more she ate, the more Lucy was beginning to grow. Lucy noticed that as she ate, she and the imaginative Lucy grew bigger in every way. Their bellies, clothes, even their hats were expanding as the weight piled on both of them. Lucy kept on eating and eating and eating until finally, Lucy was an immobile blob being squished with her conscience Lucy. Both were extremely fat and greedy at the moment as their fat folds were squishing one another. Lucy loved the size she was. Everything about her was bigger. As the stuffing finished, both Lucy's closed their eyes and at the same time repeated, \"I want to be fatter, I want to be fatter!\" They both repeated until finally, they were both asleep. At that moment, Lucy's conscience self began to become one with Lucy as both of the bodies conbined. What Lucy didn't know was that her consciensce self was really her greedy self. Lucy had fully become a greedy, evil little, or should I say, big girl.</span></div></div>",

Sure, she was really fat, but not nearly as fat as in her dream. Because of this, she saw herself as... skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be skinny. I want to be fat like in my dream. Why was it a dream?..\" Suddenly she thought of something. \"It  was all a dream, but it doesn't have to stay that way. I can become that fat! Only, I can't be fattened by my conscience. Too bad, but you can't have everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged the fat on her body as well as she could. She looked at her side and saw some turkish delight. She used her magic powers to let the box float over to her and started eating the succulent dessert. As she was pigging out, an elf opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Fat White Witch! You're awake! That's good. The White Witch wants to see you in the throne room for your next lesson,\" the Elf said to the Fat White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Tell her I'll be right over.

Not even a grain of brains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she must admit that with her weight, it was getting harder and harder to get out of bed and get dressed. The only clothing easy to put on was her hat, which was on her all of the time. Maybe she for once needed to not make any trouble about it and just let an elf dress her, even if she would be naked for a moment. Besides, her private parts would be covered by rolls of fat anyway.<br>\r\nAs fast as she could, she got dressed and waddled to the throne room. Walking was becoming more and more of an effort to her. She was getting out of breath quickly.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard the voice of The White Witch. She seemed pretty angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They still have not captured those kids? If Aslan finds those kids first, we're in big trouble! This is enough! Get the wolves over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, my dear. I'm just a bit angry at those elves. I asked them to do me a small favor. They need to capture three kids who are breaking the law and they can't even do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about those wolves?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought about using wolves to get those kids. I have more faith in them. The can also smell and track down those kids better. Anyway, it's not really any of your concern... yet. Once you rule Narnia, but not yet! You first need to learn magic. And after that, you need to know more about Narnia and how to rule it. You'll learn it all. Don't worry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to teach me?\" Lucy asked, playing with her fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something easy!\" She handed Lucy a glass. \"All around us in the air is water in a gas form. If you heat water, it becomes gas. Now I want you to focus on the water in the air. Put it together and slowly cool it so it becomes water. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try... No, I can do it! I will do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, Lucy,\" The White Witch said to the confident Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a few wolves ran into the throne room. All were gray and black with teeth sharp as knives and pink tongues hanging out of their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called us?\" The leader of the pack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! There are three kids in Narnia. I want you to capture them and bring them to me no matter what it takes. This is really important. They may not meet Aslan or else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader nodded and with a loud howl, the pack ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some water?\" Lucy asked, holding a glass full of water in front of The White Witch.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch looked and smiled at her.    </span></div></div>",

She gave Lucy a pat on her head (Really her hat) and kept on smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat White Witch, you are really advancing with your magic! Maybe soon I will teach you how to make food, like turkish delights!\" The White Witch said to Lucy with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for that! Maybe that will help me fatten up more. I need to gain even more weight...\" Lucy said, eye balling her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not happy with the way you look right now, Fat White Witch?\" The White Witch asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I am happy with the way I look and how fat I am. I just had a dream and my consciense self was stuffing me to immobility and I loved every moment of it. I wished it was real. I just want more fat until I am immobile. Even past that. I want to be the biggest thing in Narnia like in my dream!\" Lucy said to The White Witch, motioning the air in reference to being huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat White Witch, to gain more, you need to lounge more. I know you  do that a lot, but you need to do that more. Like right now. I will help you,\" The White Witch said to her heir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see! Lounge all you want, but when I need you for teaching or anything, I will call you up!\" The White Witch said, making Lucy smile. Lucy then got out of her seat and hugged the Whtie Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Lucy told her affectionately. The White Witch smiled as she felt the sack of fat hugging her. She actually cared about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now go to your room!\" The White Witch said as Lucy started to rush into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Lucy walked in, Lucy shut the door and looked around. The White Witch poofed up a bunch of boxes of turkish delights. Lucy licked her lips, loving the site of all of the food. Immediately, Lucy began to unchange out of her clothes until she was only in her hat. Lucy was bare naked and noticed her private parts besides her maturing boobs were covered. She pulled her hat tassels and licked her lips. After viewing herself, Lucy went into her bed. She put her hand out and started dragging the boxes over to her bed. With her magic, she levitated the turkish delights into her mouth one by one and continued to eat and eat and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the White Witch was thinking to herself as she was on her throne. She was happy that she was helping Lucy out. She wanted Lucy to feel happy with herself and with being here. But lately, the White Witch was noticing something. Lucy was really in love with her fat. After hearing Lucy's dream and how much she loved it, she wondered if she should make Lucy some sort of fat friend or clone. I mean, Lucy was happy, but she wondered if that would make her happier. Her mind wandered until she heard the wolves heading back into the White Witch's throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Witch,\" The head wold said to her.

And to make her not recognize her siblings, I could give her food! Yeah! Then she won't notice a thing! Or, of course, I could teach her how to transport herself. I could make her transport to her room! She would be so fascinated by it, she would stay in her room. And I could put food in her room to keep her busy!

The only thing on Lucy's mind now was how much food the White Witch would give her and how much she could eat until she would be immobile. Lucy lost count of how many Turkish delights she had eaten. The only thing she knew was that the White Witch kept on poofing them up and Lucy kept on eating and eating. After reaching into the box, Lucy notices that the box was empty. After realizing this, Lucy put her hands on her belly and started letting out moans of pleasure. She notices that her belly was fully pressing up against the box, which made her belly feel tighter as if the box was imprinting into her belly. Lucy felt her fat and played with her hat tassels as she tried to enjoy the after taste of her last binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want more, my Fat White Witch?\" The White Witch asked Lucy as she held up her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will have some more in a minute.

She was happy her heir was enjoying the sweet life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the White Witch's assistant, her elf, opened the doors in front of the throne and scurried into the room as the doors closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, a word alone with you?\" The Elf said, indicating this to the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but this better be good. Fat White Witch, head into your room. I will poof some food into there for you. I want you to go enjoy your food coma!\" The White Witch said with a smile as she watched Lucy's grin turn into a huge smile. Lucy immediately got off of her throne and went down the hall that lead her to her room. The White Witch watched as the little girl waddled the whole way there with her butt jiggling and her hat bobbing up and down. Lucy entered her room and the White Witch heard the doors shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" The White Witch said to her assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found one kid strolling along and we caught him!\" The Elf said, making the White Witch change her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is progress. No sign of the other two kids?\" The White Witch said, who could feel herself getting her hopes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None, but we caught one, which means we may have a better chance of catching the other two,\" The Elf said as he watched the White Witch shake her head in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. Well, what is his name?\" The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Edmund, my lady,\" The Elf said to his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Look, we cannot tell the Fat White Witch about this, yet. We don't want her memory to spark back.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, Lucy was sleeping, having another dream:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was in her throne room, sitting on her throne, eating more and more turkish delights by the box full. Lucy looked so big, she was definitely immobile! Lucy was the same age as she was in real life, but she looked a lot older and bigger with her fat! Her butt was stuck tightly in her throne while her thighs were so huge, the fat folds on her thighs were covering her, making her not able to move at all. Lucy had four incredibly large chins with fat cheeks on her face. Lucy's arms were as big as DVD players, Lucy was lucky that she could move her arms a little bit. Her stomach covered her whole body as it was out in every direction! Lucy still wore her while hat, white fur coat, and her white, heartless smile all thanks to the White Witch. As Lucy kept on eating, The White Witch's elf came into the throne room, which didn't even phase Lucy as she kept on eating her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat White Witch, I know the White Witch would be so proud of you right now!\" The Elf said. Lucy looked up at the Elf and smiled. In her dream, the White Witch had died and Lucy had won the war against Aslan and her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after she died, I promised her I would make her proud. How is Aslan and the children doing?\" Lucy asked her assisant Elf now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going along very well, but you are still bigger. They can't take much more. You keep on eating and I will come back later to have you stone them or eat them! Whatever you want,\" The Elf said, watching the Fat White Witch tear into her food more. The Elf then slipped out of the throne room and walked down a big hall. He kept on walking until he opened another pair of doors and walked into a room as big as a football field. In this room was a huge pile of food with a ton of elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep working!\" The Fat White Witch's Elf said to all of the other Elves. They moved and scurried around, grabbing more food. They brought this food up to four, huge figures. It was Edmund, Susan, and Peter along with Aslan. All were incredibly fat! Edmund looked like a white sack of fat with a white hat on! He was so fat and rounded. Susan looked the same, but a different color with her jacket and no hat! She was smaller, but she had boobs. Peter, the eldest brother, was the fattest kid of the three! He had a brown coat while wearing a brown fur tassle hat. He had so many chins along with a huge, round rear. His rear made him sit straight up and unable to move. And last, but not least, Aslan was the biggest creature in the room, although not as big as Lucy. Aslan was big, round, and furry. His paws were billowing with fat rolls. His arms, neck, and hind legs were gone in his round, fat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Lucy do? After winning the war and capturing the four, Lucy brought them back by force and fed them fattening, addicting foods. The four were to the point now that all they wanted to do was eat, eat and eat! Lucy was so entertained by their torture that she couldn't decide if she wanted to morph them into food (so she could eat them and become incredibly huge!) or turn them into huge stones! All four of the huge figures couldn't help but continue to induldge. But as they kept on eating and eating, Lucy....</span></div></div>",

She must have eaten a lot before she fell asleep. She saw a small rip that appeared in her dress. Quickly, she used some of her magic to make the dress bigger than it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad it was all a dream. But well, it doesn't have to stay a dream. Maybe I can become that fat! Why not? I can live centuries! The White Witch told me that. So, I'm sure I can become very fat! Just like in my dream!\" Lucy said, grabbing her hat and pulling it down on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled out of bed, looking like a beached whale! She was definitely over 200 pounds in an morbidly obese state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I'm getting pretty big! I'm going to slowly need help for some stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she waddled into the throne room. Even the short distance made her tired, sweaty, and exhausted. She was breathing loudly when she got into the throne room, approaching the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you my dear?\" The White Witch asked, noticing the exhausted Fat White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just tired from walking over here. It's getting pretty hard to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have told me, dear. Then, I could have send some Elves to help you out,\" The White Witch said, motioning to a nearby elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry! I would like some food now!\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You have such a healthy appetite. I like that,\" The White Witch said with a smile. \"Maybe I should teach you a new trick,\" She said, poofing turkish delights for Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my house. We'll be safe there for some time,\" The beaver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of them was a dam. Slowly, they walked behind him. To the left and right, you could see the river. It was hard walking on the dam since there was ice on the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my wife has counted on you children to come,\" He said while he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside they saw an old beaver woman. She was preparing some food and stirred it in a pan. Peter and Susan both smelled the delicious food. The beaver wife looked friendly at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are the son of Adam and daughter of Eve? You're gonna save our world!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Peter said. \"Save your world? We? Are you sure you have the right people? We're not really heroes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! You will save our world. It's told long ago the White Witch took over our beautiful world. She made sure it was always winter but never Christmas. Anyone who tried to stand up to her, she...\" He swallowed. \"Well, she turned them into stone. For a long time, we couldn't do anything. But now Aslan is coming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Aslan?\" Asked Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know? He's the king! He is the ruler of the entire forest. Now he hasn't been here for a long time, but we got a message he's coming. He will defeat The White Witch. After that, you'll rule Narnia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I expected four extra guests. There's supposed to be four of you. Two sons, two daughters. So where are the other two?\" The female beaver asked while she put some plates on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Edmund was taken by some small guys. And Lucy.... we don't know what happened to her,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So one of you has been captured and the other probably got captured too?\" The beaver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there's no time for food. We need to take you to Aslan right away!\" The female beaver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just so we understand... The White Witch is the ruler of Narnia and she's evil? Now Aslan is coming, the true ruler of Narnia, and he'll defeat The White Witch and after that, we will become king and queen?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a nutshell, that's it,\" The beaver said while she packed a bag. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"But what about Lucy and Edmund? They are our family. How can we save them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. She won't hurt them... yet. The only one who can save them is Aslan. So let's go!\"   <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

She watched Lucy as Lucy kept on stuffing turkish delight after turkish delight into her mouth, down her throat, and into her fat belly. By now, Lucy was so huge! Lucy's butt was big and round while her belly was round and prominent. Lucy had a triple chin now with cheeks of a chipmunk. Lucy's thighs were as big as cinder blocks. Lucy's muffin top was so huge, it looked like a giant muffin! Lucy smiled as she pulled her hat down on her head and admired her body. Lucy's face was covered with food, making her look like a fat, sloppy pig. Lucy was getting to the point where it was getting harder to move. Soon enough, she would need more help to do the daily things in life. But she didn't care as long as she was the fattest thing ever like in her dreams! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tasted delicious! I want more!\" Lucy said, grabbing the fat belly of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, my dear. But not now. Before we do anything else, I want to teach you more things involving magic and Narnia!\" The White Witch said to her heir. Lucy started to frown, but then she started to think positively. She needed to learn more things about her future and how to rule. The more she learned, the more things she could do, the better of a ruler she could be, and the fatter she could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I want to teach you how to.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the White Witch was cut off as the doors in front of the throne opened and the White Witch's elf assisant scurried into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen!\" The Elf said to the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What is it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have a situation in the dungeon. The prisoner will not stop talking and keeps on resisting arrest. We need you to come up with a punishment for him, if that is what you want,\" The Elf told the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I will be there in a minute,\" the White Witch said as the elf exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come along? I want to see the prisoner. Maybe I can help with the punishment,\" The Fat White Witch said with a smirk. Although the White Witch was nervous about the idea, this could be a great learning experience for the Fat White Witch.

Let's see how you do,\" The White Witch said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy happily stood up and followed The White Witch. However, the walk to the dungeon made her very tired. She was puffing and sweating when they finally got there. Lucy was really exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat White Witch, what did I tell you? If walking is too much effort, you don't have to walk,\" The White Witch told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I forgot. Where's the prisoner?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, two elves came in front of Lucy and the White Witch, trying to hold Edmund who was still screaming, kicking and punching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough!\" The White Witch screamed. \"Now stop it! Listen up, you little man. I believe you're a son of Adam. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I guess I am. But you have no right to capture me! I know my rights! I know the law! I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here in Narnia, I make the law! I can break any law just as easy. So any rights you know is totally useless here. But, maybe we can help each other,\" The White Witch said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never...\" Edmund started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was cut of when he was splashed by some cold water. Lucy laughed in an evil and childish way. <br>\r\nEdmund looked angry at her. The cold water alone was bad enough, but it was so cold in Narnia, the water would probably freeze on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is my heir The Fat White Witch. You can see why that's her name, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at Edmund and just for a moment, deep inside her, something happened for a second like a spark lighting up darkness before going out. She didn't think about it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still young. But believe me! What she can do is nothing compared to what I can do. So will you listen? You see, I heard you came here with two other kids. Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. My brother and sister. But we were looking for my younger sister, Lucy. She might be here, too. But we're not sure about that,\" Edmund said to the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I needed to know. Now that I have all the information I need, I could easily KILL YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please don't kill me!\" Edmund screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.... maybe I can still use you. What do you think, Fat White Witch? What should we do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at Edmund like if he was a delicious cake. She was thinking what would be best to do. She thought one moment about turning him into stone, but that was something The White Witch did and she wanted to do something she thought about on her own. Then, something came up in her mind. She remembered her dream. Maybe she could do the same thing like in her dream! Or could she come up with an even better idea?  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked into Edmunds eyes, thinking of how hopeless the prisoner will be when she starts to punish him. She patted Edmund's hat on his head, treating him like a puppy. Lucy then turned around, looked at the White Witch, and whispered into her ear about the dream that she had earlier, letting the White Witch know what she wanted to do to Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And because of that dream, I think we should fatten him to death! Or at least until we figure out what else to do with him,\" Lucy said, smiling an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lucy, that is a brilliant plan! Elves?\" The White Witch screamed, making the elves scurry and approach the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to put the prisoner in the dungeon and stuff him with food until we tell you otherwise!\" The White Witch said, which made Edmund open his mouth in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to fatten me up to death?\" Edmund said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. However I feel,\" Lucy said to Edmund, not knowing she was torturing her own brother. At that moment, the elves not holding Edmund brought in food to feed to Edmund. As Edmund saw this, the elves holding him put him in his dungeon, tied him to a chair in the cell, and began stuffing the food down his throat. After the first swallow, Edmund felt hooked to the food. It tasted delicious! Although he hated the idea of his fate, he wanted to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough bites of food, Lucy could hear Edmund say things like, \"You won't get away with this,\" and \"This food is so delicious!\" This made Lucy giggle, laughing at the torture the prisoner was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of food, I'm hungry!\" Lucy told the White Witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go and get you some food,\" the White Witch said, motioning Lucy out of the dungeon. The two began to walk out of the dungeon. As they exited, Lucy looked back, seeing that the bundled up prisoner was already showing signs of weight gain.</span></div></div>",

She had red curly hair and she seemed to be a bit around your age, maybe a bit younger,\" He said and pointed at Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be our sister! That looks nothing like Lucy,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid she's your sister. There hasn't been other people in Narnia for ages. It must be her.

You are truly learning!\" The White Witch said as they headed to the dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole ride was torture for the elves because of Lucy's sheer mass. She was very hard to carry. As soon as they got down the dungeon, all elves feel to the floor, which made Lucy's fat body crush the elves, which in a way, was like a cushion to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me up!\" Lucy commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the elves did their best to get up. They helped Lucy rise, even though it took a few minutes of struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think of your prisoner?\" The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy began to observe her prisoner. It had been a few hours since the feeding began. Already, Edmund had put on at least ten pounds as his stomach looked a tad bit bigger. It looked like Edmund was gaining some fat on his face, but not a ton. The changes weren't too heavily noticeable, but time would change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad. Could be better,\" Lucy said to the White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But we can increase the flow of food,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Lucy observed Edmund, her fattening prisoner. She noticed how Edmund seemed to look similar to her. He was even wearing the same type of clothing, which made Lucy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking, Fat White Witch?\" The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy went up to the prisoner, who was way too focused on his food, and began to pet his hat like a owner pets a dog. Lucy grinned.</span></div></div>",

After about ten minutes of solid running, they all stopped to take a breathing break from being exhausted. By this time, they were out of the forest, panting like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was exhausting!\" Susan said, hands on her knees and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been worse. Where are we now?\" Peter said as he adjusted his hat and fur coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are out of the forest finally. We have some ways to go though,\" the fox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! You can see Aslan's castle from here!\" The beaver said as they turned around. They all saw a frozen ocean with an island far out. On the island was a castle as big as it was in fairy tales. They were all amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that beautiful?\" The beaver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is,\" said a voice from behind the group. They all turned around to find a man taller than Peter wearing a fur coat with a long, white beard, white hair, and big boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, sir. How are you?\" the female beaver asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, thank you. I noticed you all were on an adventure. I wanted to give you all gifts,\" the man said, heading for a sledge located behind him. He went into it, reached into a bag and came out with gifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, I give you guys these bow and arrows to fight anyone in your way,\" the man said, handing the beavers two small bows with arrows. He then reached into the bag and grabbed more gifts. \"For you, fox, I have this,\" the man said, handing the fox a bottle of a liquid. \"This is a liquid that energizes you and gives you strength on your journey,\" the man said as the fox thanked him. The man finally looked at the two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are your gifts. For you, Susan and Peter,\" the man said. They were surprised that he knew their names, but they grabbed the gifts he handed out. Susan looked and saw that she had an liquid bottle like the fox, but on it, it said <i>Wound Repair</i>. Peter also opened up his gift and took it out of the box. It was a sword! He was surprised as he drew it out and looked at it. They both looked up to thank the man, but before they said anything, he and his sledge were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that man? Santa Claus?\" Peter said.</span></div></div>",

Since she saw that boy, something didn't seem right. It felt like she had seen him once, but couldn't remember when. Everytime she thought she remembered it, it slipped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I stop thinking about him? Did I really meet him before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to remember but couldn't find any memories. She thought nothing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just eat him! Hmmm. Could I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Lucy never thought about cannibalism. But back then, she was a sweet girl and most of that was totally gone in pounds of fat. She was a hungry and growing girl and needed good food, AKA a meal fit for a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I better wait before I eat him. I think he'll taste better when he's fat. Maybe he can be used to get those other two kids! I wonder who they are,\" Lucy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy stretched her fat legs a bit. She became very lazy. Just sitting on her throne added to her lazyness, but she liked it. The White Witch also liked her lazy, seeing her hardly moving a muscle. The White Witch had just what she wanted: An evil girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right dear. I think that was enough food for now. I think it's time for another lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch wanted to teach Lucy more magic faster than she originally planned. First was because Lucy did it very well. The second reason was since she knew Aslan was probably here. Even while she planned to rule Narnia a few centuries more, she knew there always was a small chance that Aslan would kill her. She realized that Aslan was a dangerous opponent. If she was killed, Lucy would need to take over and she wasn't ready for that. Sure, she was evil and all, but ruling Narnia.... she wasn't ready for that. She also knew Lucy realized that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's time to pay Aslan a visit, to show him I have that boy and use him like bait to catch those other two. I could also enjoy showing him who my heir is!\" She mumbled softly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to teach me?\" Lucy asked greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're still waiting until I teach you how to make turkish delight. Don't worry. It won't take long before I will teach you it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy grinned widely and looked with big eyes at The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I have an apple. But I'd rather have an orange. You understand what I want you to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn the apple into an orange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. This is more difficult since you have to make something totally new from something else. Try to make it an orange. Do your best to think of an orange,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy closed her eyes and concentrated. Slowly the apple turned orange and and soon looked like an orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" The White Witch said. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sliced with her hand past the orange peal and cut it in half. The inside didn't look like an orange, but like an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't only concentrate on the outside. Also the inside and the taste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lucy smiled. She closed her eyes strongly and concentrated. The apple with the outside of an orange started to move and changed from shape and color and the next moment, she held up a piece of turkish delight.<br>\r\nLucy grinned. The White Witch also needed to smile when she saw what Lucy had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna try it to see if it has worked?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy opened her mouth widely and The White Witch tossed it in her mouth where it soon disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tasted good!\" Lucy mumbled. \"But I'm very tired now. I think I will go to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heaved herself up from her throne. It took a lot of effort. Then, she remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves! Come over here! I need help to get to my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few elves got in and helped her on her feet. One carried her belly and the others helped her with walking to her room.

The whole group was wondering what Aslan would be like, especially Peter and Susan who had never seen Aslan before. They all knew that if they made it to the castle, they would all be safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you meet Aslan, you will be able to see why he is such an influence to our people,\" The beaver said.

Peter couldn't really see what it was yet. It was gray and very big, but as it came closer, it became clear it wasn't big. It were several creatures with the same gray fur that were bunched up together, making it look like one, huge animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those? Dogs?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's worse! Wolves!\" Peter yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan needed to think a moment about old fairy tales like little red riding hood. Sure, that was a fairy tale and she didn't believe in fairy tales since she was younger, but now, she was walking in a winter land she entered through a wardrobe. On top of that, she and her sister and brothers would need to rule this place and fight against a witch. After all that happened, why wouldn't the wolves eat them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've almost reached the castle. In there, we're safe,\" The fox said, who was running faster than the others.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them tried to run a bit faster, but the wolves came closer. They were very fast! They could clearly hear the wolves barking and growling. The long nails of the wolves made nasty clicking sounds on the bridge and crunches in the snow. But all of a sudden, it was like everything suddenly froze and every sound stopped. Peter and Susan looked around, wondering what happened. The wolves stopped and looked with their jaws wide open. Their tongues were hanging out of their mouths without moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors of the castle opened slowly. Some white light peeled through the opening and then, they saw a figure in the light walking on four legs. The figure stepped forward. The fox and beavers went aside to make room for him. <br>\r\nIt was a lion! A big lion! His fur looked like gold as he seemed strong with his eyes that made him look wise. He seemed to glow with some power that no one could explain. Slowly, he stepped forward to Susan and Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two are Peter and Susan?\" The lion asked the kids. His voice sounded wise in two different ways: one way was like from an old person who saw many things, but it wasn't a old voice when looking at it from the other way. It was a strong and powerful voice you need to obey. He looked at the wolves, opened his jaws, and let out a loud roar. The wolves turned and ran away as fast as they could with their tails between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel kind of sorry for them. Once, they were smart animals! Too bad they fell in the hands of The White Witch,\" Aslan said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Susan and Peter, who must admit they were both a bit scared, but knew he was good. It was a strange feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, Susan, come with me! We have a lot to talk about,\" Aslan said to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beavers and the fox followed behind them. The big doors slowly closed behind them. Inside the castle was a lot of creatures and animals. Some looked normal, talking animals, but others were animals they only saw in books or heard stories about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, Susan, do you know why you're here?\" Aslan asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard we need to lead you to victory,\" Peter said to Aslan, adjusting his hat and jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct,\" Aslan said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first, we want to save our siblings!\" Susan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Peter added. \"Edmund was captured by some dwarves and we heard she probably also has Lucy.

She slipped her hat tightly on her head as she observed her fattened body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, I will be immobile! Then, the elves will have to carry me when I want to go somewhere. Still, that prisoner is getting fattened. I can't forget about him. I think I need to see him again. Elves!\" Lucy yelled out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, some elves came in and bowed before Lucy's huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to help me walk to the dungeon,\" Lucy commanded to the elves. Two elves took her by the sides and one carried her belly. Lucy smiled at this. This made walking much more easier for the evil little witch. Besides, why did she need to move? She was the future ruler fom all of Narnia. Everyone need to obey her! Even that Aslan guy needed to obey her, who ever he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dungeon, Lucy saw Edmund and smiled. He was way fatter than before! He was sitting at the moment. He spread his legs out earlier so his belly could rest between them. His belly almost came to his knees! His thighs were as thick as tires and on top of that, he had big moobs. His arms were flabby and his under arms were slowly disappearing in his upper arms. He had two extra chins and his neck wasn't more than a ring of fat around it. He wore a white tassel hat like Lucy, but his hat tassels were not tied since his chins were too thick for him to tie the tassels with. His cheeks were so puffed out, it looked like he stuffed a jawbreaker in each of his cheeks. He was downright fat now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing Edmund, Lucy started to worry a little bit. Suppose he became fatter than her? Then she wouldn't be the fattest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" She said with loud voice that echoed throughout the dungeon. Everyone stopped feeding Edmund immediately. Of course, The White Witch was the ruler, but they knew they also needed to obey The Fat White Witch except when The White Witch didn't agree with Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Edmund mumbled through his fat cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet, human. I just don't want you to get fatter then me, but I want you to get fat! And even after that, maybe you can still be of any use. If you can't, well, we'll see then. At least, until I'm sure what to do with you, I need to make sure you fit in my mouth,\" Lucy said with a greedy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... gonna... eat me?\" Edmund said through his fat cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I will, maybe I won't! Didn't you listen to me? Maybe we can use you! If we can't, or at least after we used you... what will we do to you then? I don't know for sure. But maybe I'm gonna eat you at that time. But, if I do that, I need you to be able to fit in my mouth for now! After I know what we will do with you, well, I don't know yet... or maybe you will end up in here!\" Lucy said as she pointed to her belly and chuckled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund hardly couldn't believe how evil she was. She was just telling him that she was going to use him and maybe just eat him after that without showing the smallest piece of regret!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves! Bring me to the throne room! I said now!\" Lucy screamed to the elves. Edmund looked at how the elves struggled to get the fat girl out of the dungeon. He wondered why they helped the girl and why she was so unfriendly to them. Didn't they had a choice to obey? He himself felt miserable after what happened. He never really cared about his weight before, but this wasn't how he wanted to be, especially if he were to die this way. What would they do to him? How would they use him? And after that, would Edmund end up being eaten... or... what else would happen to him? Maybe something even worse would happen to him. What could be worse than being eaten alive by a fat girl? He could't think of anything worse. After thinking about that, Edmund breathed heavily as the elves locked the dungeon door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy waddled into the throne room. The White Witch smile when seeing the elves helping her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my dear Fat White Witch! How are you, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, thank you,\" Lucy said with a fat grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you come from?\" The White Witch asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dungeon. I asked them to stop feeding the prisoner. I don't want him to become fatter than myself! Besides, I'm not sure how I can eat him if he's bigger than me. Anyway, maybe we can use him to get those other two kids,\" Lucy said with a grin to The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the wolves ran inside the throne room, looking afraid as they stared at The White Witch shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are those kids?\" The White Witch said in a demanding tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had them... and suddenly, Aslan came and... saved them,\" the wolf said as he was panting to The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch looked at them as if fire was spitting out of her eyes. It seemed like her face was burning with rage. Her voice got so loud, you could hear it throughout the whole castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU STUPID FLEA CIRCUS!!! YOU NEEDED TO GET THEM BEFORE THEY REACHED ASLAN!!! CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING RIGHT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves ran out of the throne room before The White Witch would have done something to them. The White Witch was sitting on her throne. tapping with her hands, making ticking sounds with her nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, White Witch... Why don't we just go to Aslan and take that prisoner like bait?\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"We could do that,\" The White Witch said.</span></div></div>",

We will then declare war on Aslan and his followers. Once we do that, we will somehow dispose of the prisoner. You can do whatever you want to the prisoner, my dear. After that, we will be in war with Aslan and his people. We will have full control over Narnia!\" The White Witch said with an even bigger grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a great plan. You said I can do whatever I want with the prisoner?\" Lucy asked with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my dear. As long as it's evil,\" The White Witch said with an even bigger grin. They both began laughing manically. They were both truely evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves! Get the prisoner ready and the sledge too! We are going to go visit Aslan and his friends,\" The White Witch said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the elves in the throne room began to move, listening to The White Witch's orders. As they continued to get ready, a couple of elves went by Lucy and picked up her sides. Lucy smiled as she and The White Witch began to walk to the sledge. Immediately, they felt the snow fall on their faces, Lucy especially. Although she was evil, she smiled at the feeling of the snow hitting her face. They both sat down on the sledge, preparing for the journey ahead of them. At the same moment, a group of elves brought the fat prisoner, Edmund, up to the sledge in chains. As they were chaining him up, Edmund looked closely at Lucy, feeling that he had seen this girl before. Lucy gave him an evil grin as she thought about eating him. Edmund, on the other hand....</span></div></div>",

Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucy asked, not understanding what Edmund said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... are you my little sister, Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not. I'm The Fat White Witch. I'm the heir of The White Witch!\" Lucy said stubbornly. Lucy looked at Edmund, but something had happened to her. Lucy? That name sounded familiar to her. She felt a feeling like the name was a nickname you had when you were a toddler and didn't hear it for about twenty years and then suddenly hear it again. Lucy? There was something about that name, but she didn't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I know my own sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If I would have been your sister, then why didn't you recognize me earlier in the dungeon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was dark in there and you wore different clothes at home then now! I can't see your face under that hat hardly. Also, I was trying to escape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I really would be your sister, I would remember you, wouldn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, don't you remember me? All right, I maybe haven't always been the perfect brother, but come on! I haven't been so bad to you that you don't want to remember me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up! I'm hungry! If The White Witch won't give me some turkish delight, I might look for something else to eat. I think a fat person would taste delicious,\" She said, licking her lips and looking at Edmund like if he was a delicious treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch enjoyed seeing how scared Edmund got, but she knew there was a chance Lucy would really eat him and she still needed him for now. So, The White Witch made a huge box of charmed turkish delight for Lucy. Lucy quickly started to stuff her face with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, the sledge started moving. Edmund looked at what his sister was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, could I also have some Turkish delight? I really like that,\" Edmund told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at him with her eyes wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! IT'S MINE, MINE, MINE!!! YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY. IT'S MINE! MY TURKISH DELIGHT! I'M A HUNGRY, GROWING GIRL! I NEED FOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Keep you hands off the turkish delight I made for my heir,\" The White Witch said with a grin as she patted her heiress on the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some advise kid,\" The elf said. \"I would do what she tells you to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And be treated by her like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's better than becoming a rock in her garden or that fat girl's next dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she really eat people?\" Edmund asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have much people here. But she hasn't eaten anyone yet. But be careful! That doesn't go to say she won't do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking to the prisoner!\" The White Witch screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked angry at Edmund. She pointed at him and then pointed into her mouth and slowly moved her finger past her throat and stopped at her huge belly and grinned evilly at him. Edmund gulped. Even while doing all that, still, she kept thinking about the name Lucy. There was something about that name. The Turkish delights helped her clear her mind.    </span></div></div>",

Lucy realized the more she ate and stuffed herself, the more she stopped thinking and the less caring she was. She realized as she ate more, she only cared more and more about the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund couldn't understand what was going on. Maybe this wasn't his sister? Maybe it was the wrong person. But at the same time, this \"witch\" did look like his sister, Lucy, but a lot fatter. In a way, he thought Lucy was a lot prettier. His sister always used to be skin and bones. Now, he realized that she did look more mature. Also, he never admitted it before, but he did like fat girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I thinking? This is my sister!\" Edmund thought to himself. Then he thought, \"Then again, if it isn't her, then thinking that isn't a crime!\" Edmund was beginning to lose his mind. He knew that he had to continue to try and talk to Lucy and figure out the many things he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, how did you end up here?\" Edmund asked the obese heiress. Lucy looked up and gave him an evil look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY NAME IS NOT LUCY! SHUT UP AND LET ME EAT!\" Lucy said to him as she continued to stuff her face with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's you, Lucy! Think deep down!\" Edmund said to his sister. After he said that, she gave him another mean look, but she did start to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to think if she knew him before. Before she could really think about that, she began to think of a motionless, big and fat Edmund lying on the floor in her bed room chambers naked but ready to be eaten. She began to imagine herself starting to stuff him down her throat with her greedy hands as she was moaning orgasms of pleasure from the rich and savoring taste of the human flesh. She shook her head and began to come back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to shut up! Be quiet or else!\" Lucy said with another evil glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, I won't give up on you! Please try to....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT! NOBODY DISOBEYS THE FAT WHITE WITCH AND GETS AWAY WITH IT! YOU WILL BE PUNISHED!\" Lucy said as her fat moved side to side with her yelling. The White Witch smiled at Lucy's rage, proud of how evil Lucy was now. Lucy calmed herself down to continue talking. \"After we use you, I will eat you whether you are ready or not! So, enjoy your last days of living!\" Lucy said with a smile, pointing at her belly with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund couldn't believe it! He had doomed himself to be eaten. He started to cry tears of sorrow as he thought about dying. He wasn't ready, but he knew that he was past the point of no return. He continued crying as the sledge moved along as they were all heading for Aslan's castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

I'm out of turkish delight,\" Lucy mumbled and tossed the empty box aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with us!\" The White Witch yelled angrily at Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, Edmund climbed out of the sledge. He hoped that there was a small chance that Aslan could maybe do something to help him. He hoped that Aslan could maybe even save him. He sure hoped that he could. Still, he couldn't believe it that that fat girl used to be his sister. Lucy had always been nice and kind to everyone and Edmund, even when he didn't deserved it sometimes. But this girl was very evil. She seemed to enjoy pain and misery of others. She seemed to only care about food and eating. Edmund felt that she was way too fat already. That was nothing like his old sister who had always been thin like a rail. But now, she seemed evil while Lucy always was a cute girl who liked doing innocent games like hide and seek. She was nothing like this girl, but still, she looked so much like Lucy. She was way fatter, maybe, and a bit older looking, but she could also look like that because she was so fat. Was this really his little sister? If she was, there was nothing left of his old sister. He had just doomed himself. She was going to eat him. This guy, Aslan, was his last chance. The White Witch knocked on the door of Aslan's castle. Slowly, it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Aslan. Good! You're home,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund opened his eyes wide. He stopped believing in fairy tales a long time ago, but half of the creatures he saw now were things from stories and poems. The other half were animals. However, some of them walked on two legs and some wore a belt or something else that you would expect to be worn by a human and not by an animal.<br>\r\nIn the middle, he saw Aslan, a huge Lion with big eyes. He saw his big jaws and thought for a moment that Aslan could devour him just as good as Lucy could. But then, he saw Peter and Susan standing next to him and his heart made a small leap of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, White Witch? You've finally decided to come,\" Aslan said with his loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided I needed to pay you with a visit. You know a lot of animals were talking about you. Aslan is coming, they all said. You must understand... when I heard that, I needed to see you,\" The White Witch said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How kind of you. Is there something special you wanted to tell me?\" Aslan asked as he looked at The White Witch, who tried to not look Aslan in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have a heir now,\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't have children!\" One of the animals said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing too! You would be a terrible mother!\" Another yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" The White Witch yelled. \"I do have a heir. Sure she's not my child, but I raised her like my own daughter. Aslan, may I introduce you to my heir... The Fat White Witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy waddled forward, puffing a bit from the effort to move her huge body to Aslan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Lucy?\" Peter asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT LUCY! THAT'S NOT MY NAME! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? I'M NOT LUCY! I'M THE FAT WHITE WITCH! IS IS IT SO HARD TO MISS THIS HUGE BELLY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does have a point there,\" Someone in the crowd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan roared one time and the creature that had spoken kept his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's your heir. Who is that other person you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... Oh, that. I don't really pay attention to his name,\" The White Witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, Susan! It's me! Edmund! Please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edmund, what happened to you? You're so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat! That's not my fault. The witches stuffed me with food. I couldn't do anything about it,\" Edmund yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name isn't important. I think I call him... lunch,\" Lucy said as she giggled in a mean way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help me, Peter and Susan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked up at the two other children. Deep down inside her, she got the feeling she knew those names and those faces, but she couldn't remember where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan walked forward.       </span></div></div>",

I wanted to give you an offer. Give me the two kids that you have and I will let you go away in peace instead of going through war. If you accept, then you spare the prisoner's life.

Aslan then looked up at The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, in that case, see you on the battlefield,\" Aslan said with a noble grin. Peter and Susan's face were in shock at this. But as they thought, they wondered if Aslan could still save Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, Aslan. When do we start?\" The White Witch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In two days at sunrise,\" Aslan said to The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Till then, Aslan. See you soon,\" The White Witch said as she, Lucy, and Edmund backed away. Edmund's eyes and hope sunk as he felt very doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter! Susan! Help!\" Edmund screamed as the doors shut. Peter and Susan reached their hands out, wanting to save their brother. But then, the door shut, leaving them all separated. The White Witch, Lucy, and Edmund began to head back to The White Witch's castle.

The White Witch was preparing for war and thinking about her next actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she had to do was get rid of the prisoner. She knew that he would be a distraction. Now that she had used Edmund as bait, she knew that if Lucy ate him now, they would be in grief, which would give The White Witch the upper hand and possibly winning the newly declared war. She looked over at her heir, watching as she stuffed her face with more turkish delights. She smiled at this, loving the fact that her heir was enjoying every bit of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat White Witch, I have an assignment for you that you will enjoy,\" The White Witch said, making Lucy stare with big eyes at The White Witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Something good?\" Lucy asked The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to dispose of the prisoner. My dear, it is time for you to eat him,\" The White Witch said to Lucy.

The White Witch nodded as Lucy began to become over excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, head off to your room.

Bring me into my room! I need to enjoy my supper!\" Lucy screamed. The elves began to surround Lucy and help her walk to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the dungeon, Edmund hangs his fat head down, making his chins form. He looked down at the icy floor, looking at his reflection. He was fat. He was in a wonderland wearing winter clothes and he was looking like a fat sausage. He knew that now, his fate was sealed. He was going to be eaten. After observing himself, an elf came down and approached his cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fat White Witch is waiting for you in her chamber,\" the elf said to Edmund, making Edmund have a tear roll down his fat cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" Edmund said, coming to grips with his fate. The elf began to grab Edmund. More elves came to grab Edmund and transfer him to The Fat White Witch's room.

She didn't remember her siblings, but she did remember she had eaten chicken, pig, sheep, and other kinds of animals. But all those creatures were animals who were dead. She never really ate an animal alive and she surely never ate a human. Her old self would never even have thought about eating a human. That would be disgusting back at the time. But now, she was curious on how it would be.<br>\r\nSuddenly, The White Witch walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not. I forgot something,\" She said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Lucy asked as she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" The White Witch said as she pointed her magic wand at Lucy. A beam of white light hit her and after a few seconds, her whole body glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" Lucy asked, not understanding what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see. It will make it... easier,\" The White Witch said with a smirk as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, Edmund was brought into the room. Lucy looked at him and licked her lips. He looked very tasty at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lucy! Don't eat me! I'm your brother,\" Edmund said in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a brother! I don't even have a sister! And my name's not Lucy! It's Fat White Witch. Try to remember it! Ah, what does it matter? It does't matter where you're going. Pull off your clothes!\" Lucy said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Edmund asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull off your clothes! I want to eat you! I don't want to eat clothing! Now hurry up or I'll do it for you, but that will be less pleasant for you that is! I'll enjoy myself anyway,\" Lucy said as she was laughing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmund quickly pulled of his clothes off since he was afraid at what else might happen. Besides, since he was going to be eaten, it all didn't matter anymore. He took off his jacket and pulled down his pants. He then pulled off his shirt, leaving him in his underwear and hat. He them plopped off his hat and gently slipped off his underwear. When he pulled the last of his clothing down, Lucy was very happy with what she saw. All that fat on that boy was all for only her to eat! It looked so delicious to her! All that fat would be all in her body soon! Edmund felt pretty uncomfortable naked. His private parts were not too visible, but he still felt very uncomfortable naked in front of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come over here! Get in my mouth!\" Lucy screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you want to get me in the...\" Edmund started, but was then cut of when Lucy opened her mouth wider than she or any human had ever done before since no one was able to do that. Lucy found out what The Withe Witch had done to her. She knew she couldn't get Edmund in her mouth or swallow him. So, to help, she made sure she could open her mouth wide enough and let her throat expand enough for her to eat her brother. The next moment, her jaws closed around Edmund's head. Lucy swallowed hard and opened her mouth a bit wider to get Edmund's shoulders inside. She swallowed hard and slowly felt Edmund's shoulders slide inside her mouth. She felt Edmund's head hitting the back of her throat as his black hair brushed up against the back of her throat. Now, it became harder. She kept on moaning in orgasmic pleasure at the taste of the prisoner. Now, she needed to get Edmund's huge body inside of her. She started to swallow slowly and was happy she did since she got taste all the fat on her brother while his head went deeper and deeper down in his sister's throat. The hardest part was getting her brother's huge belly inside her. It was a challenge that she liked a lot. She opened her mouth wider and swallowed hard again and again and slowly, her jaws shoved closed over her brother's huge belly. She swallowed hard and suddenly, her brother's belly slid in her throat. With another hard swallow, her brother's belly entered her stomach. Lucy knew it would be all down hill from now. The next moment, her dress ripped open to make room for her more than ever bulging belly. She was moaning with pleasure at the ecstacy of the moment. She slowly swallowed and slurped his legs inside her mouth like it was spaghetti. She liked the taste of his fat, meaty thighs so much, she even chewed on his thighs until she couldn't no more. The under legs of Edmund were softly kicking, trying to help escape his fate. But for Edmund, it was too late for him. Slowly swallowing, she got his feet in her mouth. It took one swallow to get them in her throat and two more to send them down to her stomach. She felt her brother curl up in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately fell down on her fat butt, moaning loudly from the satisfying taste. She had finally done it! She had eaten a living person and enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tasted so good! I can do it again. There were two more kids that need to get captured. But, I need to fatten them up more first! They were much too skinny for my taste. But after they fatten up, they will make a nice meal. Wow, I'm so stuffed,\" Lucy said as she adjusted her hat and looked down at her belly, which was sticking out super far in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was left of her dress was pulled off by her as she crawled in her bed. She liked eating a human, but it did make her very tired. Lucy rubbed her belly, feeling Edmund's head sticking through her belly. Soon, she fell fast asleep.  </span></div></div>",

Peter was bundled up in his brown hat and jacket while Susan also bundled herself up as she shivered with her breath feeling ice cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very worried,\" Susan said as a tear rolled down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I, Susan.

Tell me how we can hope for the best!\" Susan said, hoping to hear an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we need to be positive. Edmund is a prisoner... and fat, but we can still get him back! Maybe that girl was Lucy. If it was, we just need to try and help her remember herself. If it isn't Lucy, then we know that Lucy must be in a safe place. If we fight in this war, I can guarantee that we will have answers, Susan. We just need to be positive right now,\" Peter said as he hugged his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.

Lucy was fat and evil and Edmund also fat and...\" He stopped talking when he saw the room around him. \"It... it wasn't a dream. I'm really in that freaky Narnia place. I need to save Narnia. One of my sisters and my brother are... fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter didn't hate fat people, but he coudn't think of any other thing to say. Besides, they were beyond what you would call fat. He just didn't know what he could do. He walked out of his room and walked around in the castle, sometimes seeing one of the creatures that stayed here. From a balcony, he looked at the world he needed to save. Well, he and his sibllings, but he knew he could only count on Susan's help. Edmund was captured and it didn't seem possible to be able to help them anytime soon. Lucy looked more like she was planning to destroy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about the war, King Peter?\" The loud voice of Aslan asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Listen, Aslan, I'm not sure I can do this.... I mean, go to war and lead your troops to victory. I'm still a kid. I don't think I'm ready for that. I'm not sure I'll do it right,\" Peter said as he was beginning to frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, King Peter. You can conquer anything when you put your mind to it,\" Aslan told Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will we ever see Edmund again?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you will. I'm sure about that,\" Aslan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that? Can you see in the future? Then you would know if we win the war or not. We could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see in the future. But you will see Edmund back. I promise you that,\" Aslan said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what happened to Lucy? Is she really the heir of The White Witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure The White Witch is trying to make Lucy a copy of herself. She's trying to make Lucy just as evil and just as mean. But I will try to save her, too. But that's not really something you have to worry about. I will take care of that. All you have to do is lead our troops into war,\" Aslan said, reassuring Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try, Aslan. But just suppose when we don't win this... What will happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will die, The White Witch will rule Narnia until your sister is ready for that. As for you two... I think you guys would have the same fate as Edmund,\" Aslan told Peter with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister? So that really was Lucy? You're sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without a doubt. That was Lucy. But she has changed. This isn't what she really is. The White Witch has done something to her,\" Aslan told Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she become normal again? Is that possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I will try.

I swear that I will be good!\" A fat boy said as Lucy looked down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you are good or bad! My appetite is becoming larger and larger like me. Besides, no matter what, you will join the same fat fate as yout siblings!\" Lucy said to the prisoner. In her dream, Lucy was the fattest thing ever! She had to weight at least one ton! Since she used the clothes growth spell, her clothes were fitting her. All she was now was a huge ball of fat. She was at least fifteen feet tall and wide as her whole body was covered with fat! Her arms and hands were lost deep inside her round, fat body. She still wore her hat and her dress with a fur coat, but her chins were covering her upper part of her dress. Even her arm and belly fat were poking out of random places. She was the fattest creature in the world. She licked her lips as she looked down at the prisoner. It was a boy that was a little bit older than her, but she recognized him since she saw him earlier. The prisoner was Peter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, In this dream, Lucy and The White Witch won the war. Lucy captured Susan, Peter and Aslan and made them fat prisoners. At this point, Edmund was eaten before and Susan also was eaten. Although Aslan was not eaten yet, Peter was the only sibling left. He was the fattest sibling of them all. He was at least half of the size as his huge sister. He did not want to be eaten like his siblings. What he did not realize was that he was at the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Fat White Witch! I will do anything!\" Peter said, crying his eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, huh? Would you be my King?\" Lucy asked with a grin. Peter couldn't believe what he just heard. That would be considered incest, but at least it would let him live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... Yes, my dearest Witch. I would...\" Peter said, but was then cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, I want to rule this place by myself. Nevermind, my prisoner. Prepare to be eaten. Elves! Bring him into my mouth!\" Lucy said as she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Peter felt wires wrap around his body as he was wrapped up and lifted by Lucy's mouth by a magic crane. Peter cried tears of sorrow and tried to resist. But now, it was too late. Lucy's mouth began to grow, which meant that Lucy would be able to eat Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the crane let Peter go as he began free falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOO!!!!\" Peter screamed as he fell into Lucy's mouth. After that happened, Lucy began to chew away, feeling Peter's fat body popping open, letting out blood and remains. Lucy now continued to chew as she sucked on the fat body of her prisoner. She even felt his head, hair, clothes, fat, hat, and even the innapropriate places. She was moaning in ecstacy as she was unknowingly eating her last living sibling. Now, he, along with Lucy's other siblings, were dead. All that was left was Aslan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the end of Lucy's dream as.....</span></div></div>",

It will become real. We just have to win this war and if we win, I'm sure I'll be allowed to eat those other two. But I'm not sure about Aslan. Maybe I won't be allowed to eat him. On the other hand... all that fur in my mouth..... I need to eat grass after that to lose some fur balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her out side. Her belly softly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those kids looked tasty. Just like their brother was. I wonder if he is digested by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled out of bed looking like a beached whale. Her belly almost touched the ground while standing since Edmund was digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm really getting obese. I'm getting fatter than any other person in Narnia! I'll be the fattest in Narnia! After all, I'm The Fat White Witch. And eventualy, I will rule Narnia. I'm not there yet, though. I have much to learn! But I'm on the right way,\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her body. Everywhere on her body, she could see fat folds that were getting bigger. Her whole body was covered in rolls of fat! Her arms, her legs, and of course, her belly that was two large rolls with even some small boobs on top. Lucy smiled, thinking how jealous that other girl would be seeing that she also had some boobs at this age. And after eating, some of the weight she would gain would go straight to her breasts. She loved every part of her body. She loved every pound of fat. If this wasn't her own body, her greatest wish would be to have it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... I want to be fatter. Much fatter! Sure I look fantastic and all, but I will look better if I would be fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked further at her body. Her butt was huge and would at least need two normal chairs to sit on. Lucky for her she had her throne. She always fit in there. She wondered if it grew on its own or if The White Witch made it bigger. Well If she did, it was nice of her and Lucy could also make things bigger. Lucy tried to tie her hat tassels together under her chin, but her chins were so fat that it was impossible to do so. This made her think even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! I'm so fat. Still, those two other kids..... There's something about them. Did I see them earlier? No, that couldn't have been it. And why did everyone call me Lucy? Nice name, but to rule, you need a title like \"White Witch\" or \"Fat White Witch!\" Not just a name like \"Lucy\"!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered who that girl Lucy was. Everyone said she looked like her. Would she also be just as fat as her? She worried about that. She wanted to be the fattest! Not some stupid girl named Lucy would steal that title from her. <br>\r\nShe admired her body some more before calling some elves in to help her over to the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, White Witch,\" Lucy said with an evil grin to her leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good morning to you, too, dear. How was your meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he was delicious! All that fat was pretty tasty and succulent! How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, I'm busy with that war. Aslan has a lot of creatures on his side. But, of course, I also have a lot on my side. I just hope it's enough,\" The White Witch told Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About you? But honey, I'm not going to use you in a war. You're just a kid! You could get hurt or even get killed. I wouldn't want that to happen to you! Besides, if I'm gone, you're the one who needs to take over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take over? But I don't think I'm ready for that,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but you'll learn it. If I die, you need to take revenge. You don't have to worry about the war for now. You'll be safe here in the castle. I will leave some elves here to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But eh... if you're gone, how do I make turkish delight?\" Lucy asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. It's time for that! I will teach you how to make turkish delight later this day! In the meantime, here! Have some!\" The White Witch said and she made a few boxes of turkish delight appear for Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Besides... If we win the war, can I eat those other two? After I have really fattened them up?\"       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! That's the best solution,\" The White Witch said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy grinned widely and started to stuff her face. </span></div></div>",

After you know all of the basic spells, you will be able to expand your learning and eventually, you will know all of the spells by heart!\" The White Witch said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

It doesn't have to be anything in particular, but just have something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then,\" Lucy said and closed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a formless blob appeared out of nowhere.

Then, Lucy focused again and something else changed, but it was something you couldn't see. A piece of Turkish Delight floated in front of Lucy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, honey. Try it. Eat it. You know you want it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise it doesn't taste icky like last time?\" Lucy asked her with a suspicious look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have done it right, it should taste fine. So it all depends on you,\" The White Witch said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy opened her mouth and wolfed the piece of Turkish Delight in one bite and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm! That tasted good! It tasted really good! But it's a bit hard,\" Lucy said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, little one. When I was young, I also found it hard to do it. But I did it more often and now, it hardly cost me any trouble. I want you to do it everyday a few times. With that war, I won't be here! So, you can make any food for yourself and make what you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only know how to make Turkish Delight,\" Lucy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can make any other food in the exact same way. I thought we should make Turkish Delight since you liked it so much. But, you can make any kind of food the same way. While I'm gone, you can eat anything that you like the whole time. And don't worry about the war!\" The White Witch said to her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLucy heard it, but was still worried. She didn't want The White Witch to die. She could at least turn some of the army to stone. She wondered why she didn't do that to Aslan. He was probably immune for it. She didn't like Aslan, but she felt a huge power when he was around. She knew Aslan had great power. She didn't know how great and what it could do, but she knew he had great powers. Only that voice was enough to make you scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aslan will lose! The White Witch will win this war! And I'll eat the prisoners,\" She said and chuckled evily. \"Everyone obey The White Witch!\" </span></div></div>",

This made Lucy happy since this meant she could do anything she wanted to do. She could change the whole place around and make the castle look different. She could just sit on her throne and have no one yell at her. She could even move around the castle naked. She even thought about doing that right at the moment, but for now, all Lucy wanted to do was go into her bed room, lay in her bed naked and just pig out on everything she could make. Before attempting to get up, Lucy looked around for the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves?! Come here and help me to my bed chamber!\" Lucy yelled in a snotty tone. The elves eventually came into the room and rolled their eyes at her. They approached the lard of the witch and began to help her. Many of them lifted up her belly and her sides while two of the elves helped Lucy walk and be able to move her legs. After ten minutes, Lucy was in her bed room and breaking a sweat. She was panting from what felt like a long trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now undress me!\" Lucy demanded to the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fat White Witch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO BUTS! Undress me, you idiots!\" Lucy yelled to her slaves. Reluctantly, the Elves helped Lucy slip out of her clothes until she was butt naked. Lucy was only wearing her hat by her demands as the elves tried to look away from Lucy's fat and naked body. They felt Lucy since the cotton balls at the ends of Lucy's hat tassels were hitting and covering her boobs, but not that much. Lucy felt like her hat was just a part of her now as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the elves undressed her, they helped Lucy move into her bed. As she rolled into her bed, she let out a fart here and there as she smiled with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it,\" Lucy said to herself. Lucy noticed that her stomach was like a mountain under her bed sheets as her sheets were raised up very high, making it hard for Lucy to see over the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, until The White Witch returns, I shall eat, become fatter, and maybe remain naked. I can do what I want!\" Lucy said as she grinned to herself. She began feeling her whole body and letting out orgasmic moans of pleasure. She was in love with her body. If she could marry herself, she would. After she continued to feel herself more, Lucy began to think about Turkish Delights. She began to imagine a box of them right in front of her. Before she knew it, Lucy was moaning more from the taste of Turkish Delights.</span></div></div>",

Back in the real world, they would have gone outside and explored while taking a walk or having a picnic. It all seemed so childish now. Now there was a war. He needed to lead a war while his brother was captured and his younger sister was brain washed by a wicked witch and he need to fight that witch with an army of talking animals and mythical creatures that he never even thought could existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ready?\" He thought to himself while he looked down from the top of the hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the army of The White Witch would come. Peter had put on a battle plan together with Aslan. But now, he was alone. He wondered what Aslan was going to do. And where was Susan? He already missed two of his siblings and if he would lose this war; he would never see them again. He couldn't stand the thought that he would also lose his other sister. But he knew Susan could take pretty good care of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right, King Peter the Great One?\" A centaur asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I'm a bit worried. I never ever lead a war. I never even lead a war while playing risk,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask... what is risk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's a board game,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like chess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, something like that. You also play some kind of war. But it's not real. It's with friends. Just for fun,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wars are never fun, King Peter the Great One. Especially not when the other people once were friends of ours,\" The centaur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just not sure I can do this. I'm just a boy. Now I suddenly need to lead a war,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have faith in you, King Peter. Our lives belongs to you,\" The centaur said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does make me feel better. Thank you,\" Peter said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, an eagle flew over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The White Witch is coming! The White Witch is coming!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter grabbed his sword and looked down the hill. All evil creatures of Narnia gathered in the army of the White Witch. Dwarves with axes, wolves, spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants, nightmares, sea snakes , monsters, and Peter even saw a few giants. Many were creatures he used to be afraid of when he was a child until he believed they didn't exist. But now they did, which was a strange thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter suddenly thought about his poor brother, Edmund, and his sister, Lucy, who were taken by The White Witch. The rage spread through his body. He became angry, but Peter knew what to do. He took a deep breath and stayed calm. Pure anger wouldn't help him, but only blind him. He had to stay calm but use that anger. He knew he had to win or else his siblings were doomed. Not only them, but he and all creatures here who believed in him, too. He couldn't let that happen. Suddenly, he felt confident. They trusted him. He wouldn't let them down. He raised his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ATTACK!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll creatures attacked. You could see moving fur, skin, scales with loud screams and the sound of metal on metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I be helping Peter in the war?\" Susan asked while she saw what happened from an area away from the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to save your sister and brother, right? Peter Is the one who can lead the war. But if I need to save Lucy, it's better if she sees someone she trusts,\" Aslan said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it seems like she doesn't even know me. You remember what she said when we saw her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. But If she becomes normal again, she'll see me, a huge lion. It could scare her. Besides, maybe you can help her return her memory. I need to go there anyway. We need to get a part of my army back,\" He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which part?\" Susan asked in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The part that The White Witch turned into stone. I need to save them, your brother and sister. Come! Climb on my back,\" Aslan told Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan did as she was told and held tight to his hair. Aslan started running. He was so fast that Susan's eyes quickly started tearing, but she loved the feeling at the same time. She hardly could see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is all over, I need to come back here to see it all,\" She thought to herself.              <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally, they came closer to the castle of The White Witch.</span></div></div>",

At this moment, Lucy was lying in her bed while eating Turkish Delights made by herself. All she did was sit in her bed naked with only her hat on and ate until she needed to make more Turkish Delights. The elves stood right outside of her room to guard her and make sure she was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go sit on my throne,\" Lucy said to herself as she tried to lift herself up out of her bed. Sadly for Lucy, she was unsuccessful. She knew that she was going to need help from her elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves?! Get in here now!\" Lucy commanded through a mouthful of Turkish Delights. They quickly rushed in and looked at The Fat White Witch just lying in her bed. They looked on the ground and saw her clothes lying there, which meant a bad sign for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me out of my bed and change me into my clothing, you useless minions,\" Lucy said with a smile as glowing as the sun. She knew that this was awkward for the elves since they would have to see her naked body in all of it's glory. With looks of distress on their face, the elves slowly helped The Fat White Witch rise out of her bed and stand on her feet. They were shocked with the view. They saw her boobs that were larger than EE. Her belly was distended so far with fat rolls that no one could see her private area down below. Her thighs rubbed up against each other all the way down to her knees. They even saw a full view of The Fat White Witch's arms that were filled with fat and forming rolls of their own. She now had multiple chins that all covered her neck, which made her look very stuffed. As she was laughing in her own pleasure, the elves slipped on her underwear followed by her dress. They took off her hat to do this since they put it over her head. They finally put on her white fur coat and then replaced her hat on her head. Lucy looked at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful. Perfectly stunning. Now, bring me into my throne room,\" Lucy said as she tried to point to the door, but she had trouble lifting her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, the elves all brought her into her throne room and helped her sit down onto her throne, which Lucy knew felt tighter on her rear end. She then re-made her Turkish Delights and began to eat. All Lucy thought about was how lucky she was. She maintained this state for a few more moments until panic began to arouse. Almost immediately, the leader of the wolves rushed into the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Fat White Witch, we are in trouble. Aslan is on his way here with one of the children to try and capture you! He has been sighted not too far away from here!\" The wolf said in a panic. All of the elves began to freak out about this, but Lucy did not seemed worried yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, you elves!\" Continue,\" Lucy yelled out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The White Witch commanded that if this happened, we needed to take you to one of the secret passages in the castle and get you out of here. We need to get you out of here right now!\" The wolf said out loud. Now Lucy began to feel a little bit of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves, help me up and escort me to safety now!\" Lucy said to the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It looked like a castle made of ice, but her vision was still blurry because of the speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It that the castle of The White Witch? Is that where we find Lucy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I surely hope so,\" Aslan said to Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan suddenly made speed. Susan held on tightly and with one mighty jump, he was over the wall.<br>\r\nSusan could see some creatures made out of stone. She remembered what Aslan said when he said he needed to \"get some of my army back.\" She also saw a giant and remembered seeing a few of them in the army of The White Witch. She wondered if giants were also good creatures. She remembered some stories where the bad guy also killed his helpers if they made a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these are all good creatures? You're sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but your sister is more important right now. We will come back soon for them,\" Aslan said in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan jumped at the door and destroyed it like it was made of cardboard. He ran through the castle and seemed to know exactly where he was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the elves wanted to take Lucy somewhere safe. But Lucy was way too fat to be fast and before they even left the throne room, Aslan rushed in. Two elves ran away screaming. The last elf just stood there shivering like a leaf in the wind. He didn't know what he feared more: disobeying the orders of The White Witch or Aslan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems like dinner just has arrived,\" Lucy said calmly. \"But you're way too skinny to eat yet. I need to fatten you up first,\" Lucy said as she licked her lips at Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Lu. Not going to happen. I'm happy with my body,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who Is Lu may I ask?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what we call you. Lu is short for Lucy,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that's not my name! How much fatter do I need to get for you to remember my name is The Fat White Witch? Is that so hard to remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call you that because you are Lucy and you just don't know that anymore. Come on! Try to remember,\" Susan said while she looked Lucy in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Aslan said. \"Let me try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Lucy who got a bit scared now. He still was a great, powerful lion. Lucy tried not to show how scared she was. Aslan opened his mouth wide and breathed in Lucy's face. Lucy blinked a few times and looked at Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan. Susan. Oh, Susan! I remember everything. You, our parents, our brothers, that we needed to leave and... all the horrible things I did! I was the worst brat ever,\" Lucy said as she looked at her body. She fell on her knees and started to cry long and loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault!\" Aslan's mighty voice said. \"The White Witch made you forget who you were and made you evil possibly because of some enchanted food or drink,\" Aslan told the sad Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy remembered all the Turkish delight she ate. Then she started to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, don't cry. It's all all right now. You couldn't help yourself. We forgive you. Don't worry,\" Susan said as she comforted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it's Edmund. I... I ate him. I'm... I'm so sorry.... It's just... I ...I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate Edmund? Lucy... What do we... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there is a way to save him! But I need something special for that,\" Aslan told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucy asked. \"I will do anything. I'll even give my life for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to bring someone back to live. Normally, it can't be done. But since The Fat White Witch ate him while she was really Lucy but under a spell, we might be able to bring him back. But in order to do that, you must regret what you've done. But you have that. That was obvious. But I need magic for that. I believe, Lucy, you have some magic?\" Aslan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I?\" Lucy asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't The White Witch teach you any magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she did...\" Lucy said as she made a box of Turkish delight appear and start to eat it. \"I can still do it,\" Lucy said as she ate the Turkish delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we bring back Edmund, you will lose your magic. You will be a normal girl again who wouldn't be able to let a feather float. Do you accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed. She really liked her powersm but she liked her brother much more. Maybe losing her powers was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I accept. Do it,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan breathed in her face and let out a mighty roar! A yellow light appeared around her and Lucy felt like something was pulled out of her. The yellow light turned into a spiral. It slowly became less and when it was gone, there was Edmund bundled up in his fur coat and hat just like he had always been before he was captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy and Susan both rushed forward to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? How did I get here and... Lucy, is that you. How did you get so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember anything?\" Susan asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I remember we played hide and seek. We walked into a closet and were suddenly in a strange winter land and looked there for Lucy. And now, the next moment, I'm here. Did I miss anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked at Aslan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's good that he doesn't remember. Did you have anything to do with that?\" Susan asked as she was whispering to Aslan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems like we found Lucy. So we can go home now, right?\" Edmund asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're in a war. I'll tell you what you need to know. Aslan... de-stone or whatever it's called to bring your army back. We have a war to win,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in a war? I thought our plan was to be away from the war,\" Edmund said.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"In another world it was. But in this world with war... It's not. Try to feel brave Edmund. We need to fight,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one problem. Could you help me walk outside? It's hard to move with this fat body. Ho do I get there?\" Lucy asked.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"I think we need some giant power!\" Susan said with a grin as she was remembering the stone giant outside. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About a half an hour after Lucy was back to normal, they were ready to leave the castle. This time, there were more people coming out than there were coming in. Immediately, Aslan had de-stoned all of the people that The White Witch had turned into stone. By the time Aslan was done de-stoning, there were over a hundred more people to add to the army fighting The White Witch. Aslan told them all what was going on as all of the creatures agreed to help fight against The White Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army was a sight to see. There were many different types of creatures that were leaving to fight for war. There were giants taller than pine trees walking along to the battle. Centaurs gallopped away with determination filled in their hearts. Many different types of mystical birds flew over head as they were getting a view of the snow-covered land that was their home. In this mix of people was Aslan, who was leading the pack as Edmund held onto him on his back. Behind him was a giant that was carrying Susan and Lucy, her now fat sister who remembered everything. As they were traveling back, the sisters were talking to each other as they were both happy with their reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Lucy. You really do look different. You know that, right?\" Susan said as she studied her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I mean, a lot of me is different besides the extra weight,\" Lucy said as she grinned down at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I mean, your hair is longer and more curly. Your eye color seems a little bit lighter, but not that different to me. You're wearing different clothing, too. The white dress that fits on your body looks very pretty on you. And surprisingly, the hat on your head just tops off everything along with the extra weight. I mean, you're even bigger than me now by many pounds. It's all so different,\" Susan said to her sister as she continued to study Lucy's new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly what you mean. The White Witch changed some things on me. I mean, when I came here, I was obviously very skinny. But also, I was wearing a brown fur coat along with my plaid dress and a brown tassel hat. My hair was also very straight, but short too. I do look different. Although The White Witch was pure evil, I do think that this look does make me very pretty. I likes the new appearance, the new clothes like the hat, and even the weight on my body. I think it makes me look more cute. What do you think?\" Lucy asked her sister, hoping that she would feel the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan studied her sister more and came up with what she felt.</span></div></div>",

I looks kind of cute in a way,\" Susan told her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by in a way?\" Lucy asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means that your fat can be seen in different ways. I guess some people can call it cute,\" Susan said. On the other hand, she did remember that when she saw babies, she always liked to cuddle and play with them. Normally those babies also had chubby limbs that looked adorable. Looking at it from that way made her fat and her new look kind of cute. Of course, Lucy was way past the point of chubby. <i>But still....</i> thought Susan to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how will other people call it?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan didn't know what to say. She knew very well that a lot of girls at her old school tried to stay slim and thought fat people were disgusting. But she wasn't planning to tell that to Lucy. She didn't want to make Lucy cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some other people will not like it as much. It's just like food. Some people like sausages a lot. Others just like it a bit and some hate sausages. Some will like it and some will not. Don't worry too much about it, Lucy. Not yet,\" Susan told her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you think I'm pretty,\" Lucy said with a fat grin. Susan looked at her sister and thought that her sister looked pretty. Not that she fell in love with her sister at that look. She was hetero, but she thought her sister looked pretty. All the fat, clothes, and new hair did look very good on her sister. Susan did not want to be fat herself though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... But Susan, you mentioned something about a war?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I thought I already told you. Aslan created this world. Narnia is his creation. The White Witch took over and made it always winter in Narnia. There was a prediction that four kids would come together with Aslan and then The White Witch will be defeated and the four of us will become king and queen of Narnia. Now we are going over to the war. Peter is there all alone,\" Susan said in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan looked down at the battlefield. Then he looked at his new army and opened his mighty jaws and said: \"All right you all... ATTACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan's loud scream made all the others stop fighting for a moment. Then Aslan's \"RAWR!\" sounded over the battlefield. Screams of joy could be heard. Creatures started to gain hope now that Aslan arrived and many were happy to see old friends or relatives back alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Lucy. I need to help them,\" Susan said. \"Hey Pegasus! I need a lift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flying horse flew over to Susan. Like an amazon, Susan jumped from the giant right on the back of the flying horse and the next moment, she took an arrow, put it on her bow and joined the others in the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Peter was busy fighting a minotaur. But also, he had seen Aslan with Edmund and the giant who carried two people that he assumed were his sisters. It was a bit difficult to see from this distance. Besides, he was very busy now not getting killed. But a centaur saw the trouble and the next moment, the minotaur was killed with an arrow. Peter looked thankful at him and saw for a moment how his oldest sister also joined the war. She was calm and every arrow she fired hit a target. There were also a lot of statues around. The White Witch had been busy. But suddenly, Peter jumped in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! We meet again,\" The White Witch said. \"Do you really think you can beat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her wand away and suddenly she had a stone knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's much too risky to turn you into stone. Aslan could turn you back. So I'm more wise to just kill you right now. After that, I only need to kill that other big sister of yours and then I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems my sisters and brother just arrived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe White Witch looked at him and then looked over her shoulder. She saw the giant with what was supposed to be her fat heir. Also, there was Aslan with the boy on his back that was supposed to be in the belly of her heir. And then, she saw Susan in the air shooting arrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAslan had defeated her. He took away her heir and brought that boy back to life. But at least she could take Peter with her. She tried to stab him, but Peter stopped her attack with his sword. Both started fighting so fast that the knife and sword soon were both a blur while the new part of the army started to help Peter's army. The giant put Lucy down somewhere away from the battle and ran to the others to help. Lucy had a good view of the battlefield and wished she could help.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter and The White Witch continued to fight like they were a pack of wolves. They were so busy fighting, they didn't realize some of the snow was melting. There was still a lot of snow, but there was less than before. After each swing of their swords, loud clinking sounds were heard across the battlefield. They continued to fight each other as both of them saw no end in sight. After one swing, Peter fell on his butt and hit the ground. His sword flew out of his hands and moved a couple feet away from him. The White Witch grinned at this. Suddenly, her stone sword turned into a crystal knife. She stood above Peter as the pointed end was facing his face, making him realize that this could be the end of him and Narnia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took away my heir, my victims, and my power. This is my land! Not yours, not Aslan's land, but mine! But I will take it back now! Goodbye, Son of Adam,\" The White Witch said as she began to move her crystal knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter could only think that this was the end. But luckily for him, it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shattering sound stunned The White Witch and Peter. Peter looked up and found the source. Right behind The White Witch stood a tall, brave lion named Aslan with Edmund holding onto his back side. With his paw, he clawed the crystal knife and broke it into a million pieces. The White Witch's cruel smirk turned into a pale frown of fear and sorrow. She knew now that this was the end of her solemn hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked into the eyes of Aslan, she started to feel herself fall apart on the inside as if she were evaporating. With one final look, Aslan swayed his paw with his claws, swung at The White Witch and made her fall to the ground. The White Witch continued to remain motionless on the ground as everyone stopped and looked on. They began to notice that The White Witch was starting to dissapear as parts of her body began to fade away. It was almost as if she was melting, but instead, slowly dissapearing. Within a minute, all that remained was the crown of The White Witch. Before Peter could grab it, it vanished. The White Witch was finally dead. Narnia was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers of victory started to echo across the battlefield as The White Witch's army started to retreat with Aslan's army chasing them away. Peter grabbed his sword and held it tight, realizing that he was the leader that lead this world to victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Aslan. You saved my life,\" Peter said to the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Peter. You saved my world along with your siblings,\" Aslan told Peter as Edmund smiled to his brother and as Susan and Pegasus hit the ground. The three siblings immediately hugged each other with happiness. Then Peter remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Lucy?\" Peter asked Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe and sound. She's up on the hill. I think we should go to her now!\" Susan told her brother. With that, they hopped on Aslan's back and headed up to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, watching the whol war from beyond was Lucy. Since she was very fat now, she was sitting on the ground watching the battle the whole time. She was shocked to see all of this happen. She was partly sad that The White Witch was dead since she was friendly to her. But Lucy knew that The White Witch was a manipulator and that she had to die. Lucy started to wonder if parts of The White Witch would be inside of her. She had no clue, but then again, she really didn't have any signs of that at the moment, which made her not worry. All she could think about was her siblings as they headed for her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy!\" Peter yelled at her sister. He noticed that she looked different and fat, but he could care less at the moment as they embraced with a huge hug. Edmund and Susan joined in as all four were finally reunited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you're alright,\" Peter said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too! I mean, I look different, but I am glad that I have you guys back,\" Lucy said with a grin. Aslan smiled as he watched the siblings embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all four of you have saved my land. You are meant to be the real rulers of Narnia,\" Aslan said with pride. All four kids looked in shock and surprise when hearing this. They felt many emotions. Susan looked at her sister and noticed a weird look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Lu?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy then started to talk to her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I did some terrible things,\" Lucy said in a discouraged voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, that wasn't really you. It was the power of The White Witch that did make you evil. Besides, you haven't done that many terrible things. If we would have saved you later, you might have been right,\" Susan told her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are terrific. But do the other creatures of Narnia want me to be their queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they will,\" Aslan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy saw a whole row of wounded creatures that were waiting by the fox with his bottle of liquid so that he could cure them. She looked at the battlefield. Aslan turned every statue back to life immediately. Everyone seemed happy The White Witch was finally dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we're now kings and queens of Narnia?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Aslan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lucy saw a small animal run towards them. She suddenly saw it was a squirrel because of his big fluffy tail. He smiled friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to invite the four kings and queens for a delicious dinner tonight to celebrate our victory of The White Witch,\" said the Squirrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute. Did you say all four of us? So I'm also invited? I can also come?\" Lucy said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You're queen, Lucy the good one. We all want to treat you and your sisters and brothers like the kings and queens you all are. You are all the real rulers of Narnia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" The beaver said. \"A lot is destroyed thanks to The White Witch. But it's starting to get better. The snow is already melting. But it will take some time before everything will be all right here. But with you four are rulers, I'm sure everything will turn out fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we will do our best,\" Susan said. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"They want me, too,\" Lucy said slowly. \"Aslan, am I cured now from any spell from The White Witch? I mean, there's nothing left of her in me, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Lucy. You're totally free from The White Witch,\" Aslan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the others. Most must be cured by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan, Peter, Edmund? Can you help me walk? It's a bit hard for me to move now,\" Lucy said as she patted her fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, they were all sitting on the grass field enjoying a good meal and enjoying dances from dwarves with the sound of flutes played by saters. There were a lot of campfires everywhere. Almost everyone wanted to thank Peter because he lead the war and that it would be a honor to fight with him again. Peter was happy with that. Not that he liked fighting so much, but he knew as king, you sometimes need to fight like they did today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right Lucy?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now. No one seems to mind how evil I was,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Now we need to rule Narnia. Besides, Lucy, are you going to lose that weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so. You know I like it. It's warm, it feels cozy, and it feels nice and soft,\" Lucy said with an even fatter grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your body. Want some Turkish delight?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's face turned a bit green and looked the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I want to eat anymore Turkish delight for as long as I live,\" Lucy mumbled.  </span></div></div>",

She was staring straight up at her ceiling and noticed that the ceiling she was looking at was very different than the one she saw before in The White Witch's castle. Her ceiling had tints of red and gold that wrapped around the room. Her bed was even bigger than it was in The White Witch's castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy rubbed her eyes and began to move her fat legs to the side of her bed, which made her swing her body. She could feel her body jiggle as she moved. By now, she was definitely very fat. After a night of celebration and excitement, Lucy went to bed without wearing any of her clothing. She remembered this as she looked down at her fat body. She was lost in the amount of flab that spreaded across her body. Like she told Susan, she wanted to keep the pounds on her body and maybe even gain some more weight. Lucy felt even more excited. Now she was one of the Queens of Narnia. She could probably spend her days eating and ruling and becoming even fatter. She was looking forward to her future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a few animal servants came in to help out Lucy since it was hard for her to walk and let alone change herself. Two of the animals helped her stand up while the other animals grabbed her clothing and started to help her. Two birds grabbed her large sized white dress and slipped it on over her head. After she got it on herself, the birds went behind her and tied up the back strings for the dress. In the meantime, another bird flew up and placed Lucy's hat gently on her head, which made Lucy smile. A fox was at her feet as it helped Lucy put on her shoes and tied her laces. The birds even helped Lucy put her coat on her, making her look like the same old Lucy she had looked like for the last little while. They had changed her a lot better than The White Witch's servants had. Lucy's body wasn't even this big and the animals changed her into her clothing more peacefully. Lucy smiled at the servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, you guys. I really do appreciate it,\" Lucy said with her fat, pudgy smile. The servants bowed their heads back to her and helped her start to walk. Lucy was so happy with this new place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm living in paradise now. Everything is peaceful and happy. I am so happy that everything has worked out for me,\" Lucy thought to herself as she giggled to herself. She started to think of what she wanted to do next. She was becoming more curious about her weight. She had no idea how much she weighed. She knew that she had gained a lot, but she didn't know the exact number. Also, she wanted to find ways to add on extra pounds. She thought quickly as her servants helped her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you all don't mind, I would like to....</span></div></div>",

Doesn't any one of you have a scale? Or do you never check your weight?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we do. We have some scales at hom, but even if we would take them here, I'm afraid it won't help you since... I think you're way heavier than the maximum weight,\" said the fox, which made Lucy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..... but I would like to know my real weight,\" Lucy said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we of course could make a bigger scale that can hold a bigger amount of weight. That should be possible,\" A bird said and looked at the other animals in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, the dwarves are very handy to make anything made of metal. I will ask them right away. I'm sure they will do it for the fattest Queen of Narnia.\" The fox said. \"Dwarves like it if their woman are a bit chubby. I don't know why really,\" the fox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox ran away to give the news to the dwarves while a few other animals helped Lucy walk over to the throne room. Lucy suddenly noticed how warm it was here. She remembered how cold it always had been in the castle of The White Witch. She never really noticed that back then. <br>\r\nThere were four thrones in the room. One for all four of them, but they were all empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are my brothers and my sister?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the dining room eating breakfast and waiting for you,\" A faun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy licked her lips. Sure, she wasn't evil anymore and was a nice girl again and wanted to help any creature in Narnia, but she was hungry now and still loved some good food. As long as it wasn't Turkish delights. She had eaten so much of it and remembered how it changed her that she could hardly look at and think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came into the dinning room and saw her siblings and also a few of the animals that helped them most like the beavers and some other magical creatures. But out of all of them, she noticed one was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where's Aslan?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he just left. If you're fast, you can see him leaving,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy quickly waddled to the nearest window and saw him leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to let him go,\" The beaver said. \"He has other things to do. But I'm sure he will return once again. He comes and goes whenever he wants to. He isn't a tame lion,\" The beaver told Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sighed. She was a bit sad Aslan left, but knew that what the beaver said was true. Suddenly, she noticed she was starving and turned to the table but noticed her belly was in the way of reaching for the table. Some of the others laughed softly and some came to help Lucy and feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is our first days of being King and Queens of Narnia. We will try to rule your country as well as possible. But we will need a lot of help to know everything about Narnia,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we will all be glad to help you four,\" The beaver said.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, take it easy,\" Susan said suddenly. \"You don't have to eat so fast. It's not like anyone is going to take it away from you and there's more then enough,\" Susan said to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just very hungry. I might not be evil anymore, but that doesn't mean that I will stop gaining or that I'm not hungry,\" Lucy said through a mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we knew how to stay alive with the food we could get while we were in an endless winter. Now we can grow vegetables, grain and so on. I think we'll have enough food, even for the great hunger of Princess Lucy, the fat one,\" A faun said, which made Lucy really grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure some of the tree spirits would like it to help let vegetables and grains grow,\" A leopard said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're planning to keep the weight and gain even more?\" Peter asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What's wrong with that?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter took one look at Susan and then at Edmund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. What's wrong with becoming fatter? But just be careful that you don't gain too fast,\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the centaurs and Pegasus, by the way?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I invited them inside, but they liked to stay in the forest, or in Pegasus's case, in the air,\" Peter said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled widely well she was fed more food.   </span></div></div>",

Immediately, the animals complied and helped Lucy out of her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, we will be here if you need us. Just don't rush into things too quickly, okay?\" Peter said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I won't. I will see you all later,\" Lucy said as the animals helped her out of the room. Right after the doors shut, the three other siblings looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she really going to become fatter?\" Peter said to Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she talked to me about how much she wanted to gain and how she liked it. Besides, I do think it does look cute on her,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it, too. There's so many girls that try to be skinny today. I like seeing some bigger ones,\" Edmund said in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know if I am on board with it, but as long as we have her, then all is well,\" Peter said as his siblings agreed. They then continued to get back into business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucy was with the animals waddling down the hall as she was heading to her room to use her scale. She was very excited to see how much she weighed at this point. Just not too long ago, Lucy was probably one of the skinniest girls you would see. But now, Lucy had become so much wider and fatter. All she was was fat with no muscle. But Lucy didn't care. She loved her fat and she loved gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was thinking about this, Lucy kept on looking at the items down the hall. There were many portraits of different parts of Narnia and pictures of Aslan. Lucy smiled at this since she was very thankful for being saved by Aslan. She kept on looking until she saw a door that was so big, it was triple Lucy's height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in that room?\" Lucy asked the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the room of undisclosed desires. Only few have and can go into the room. You and the others are allowed to go in, but it is a very powerful room. Whatever you want, you will get from the room only if you deserve it,\" The fox said back to Lucy. Lucy looked mysteriously at the room as they walked on and finally came up to Lucy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I get weighed, I need to go in there,\" Lucy said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

She decided to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... did they already have this scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they did. They normally used it to weigh gold, silver and valuable rocks. So I guess it can tell how much you weigh,\" the fox said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy thought back one moment about the room. She wondered if it really was true. Could the room do anything you wanted? Only if you deserved it, the fox told her. She wondered if she deserved anything after what she had done. But that wasn't her own doing. It was because of The White Witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe before never saw herself as mean. She was a nice girlie girl and mostly thought about others before herself. Sure, she had been bad sometimes, but who hasn't? Most of the time she had been nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, Queen Lucy?\" Someone asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, yeah of course,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Queen Lucy, if you do gain much more weight... well I'm not sure we will be able to help you walk. You have a chance of becoming immobile. If you want to, we're fine with it, but you need to know this before you do it,\" someone else said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did make Lucy think. She'd love being fat and gaining weight since it was great, but not being mobile anymore was a problem. At the castle of The White Witch she could float and let things appear so she never really worried about it. But now...  she really needed to think about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's first see how much I weigh. After that we'll see,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she placed her feet on the scale. The fox looked at how fat she was. All animals in the room were quiet, curious about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's around 675 lbs,\" The fox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's very impressive for a girl your age,\" A squirrel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't believe there has ever been a heavier girl. At least not at this age,\" another animal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled since she liked hearing she was the fattest girl ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all. That does make me feel good. Now you can go. I'll call you if I need help,\" Lucy said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals left and Lucy started to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she loved being fat and gaining weight, but never being able to walk again would be hard. She wanted to see Narnia in his pure glory. Outside, the snow was almost gone. On the other hand, the giant could always carry her. He was really nice, but not too bright.<br>\r\nThen she thought about the room. She could wish for more weight. That would be fun, but on the other hand, that would make her lose the fun she had with eating. Or she could wish for staying mobile. Would that be possible? Did she deserve it was also a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy thought about an hour and then decided...  </span></div></div>",

She wanted to see if she was worthy of being able to be in the room. After deciding this, she called for the animals that helped her walk before. Immediately, they came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you all help me walk to the room down the hall? I want to check it out,\" Lucy told them with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I mean, no one knows what people are worthy of it,\" the fox mentioned to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure. It's worth a try to see,\" Lucy replied to the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the fox shook her head in acceptance to the idea and the other animals started helping her walk out of her room. Lucy was feeling excited, but a little scared since she really didn't know what to expect out of this. She just hoped everything would work out well. After a few minutes, the animals stopped helping her move as Lucy discovered they had helped her to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I can get it from here now,\" Lucy said to the animals. The animals started to go away except for the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\" the fox asked her one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. I need to see this,\" Lucy said to the fox. The fox complied and let her be. Immediately, Lucy slowly moved her fat leg forward as she tried to push the door open. As the door started to open, a bright light started to show, enticing Lucy and her fat body forward. Within a minute, Lucy entered the room and shut the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door shut, the room got very dark, which came across as creepy to Lucy. She had no idea what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy,\" said a voice. She looked around and saw no one as the room got a little lighter. All it was was four brick walls surrounding her. She wondered where the voice was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down, you plump beauty,\" the voice said to her. Lucy turned around and saw a chair magically appear before her eyes. It surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you coming from?\" Lucy asked the voice as she sat down in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the voice of desire. I give the ones who deserve their wants the most glorious things they could desire. Only if they deserve it,\" the voice said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I deserve my desires from you?\" Lucy asked the voice quietly. After that, there was a silence. The next thing she heard was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes. You deserve your desires to come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy smiled and her eyes started to sparkle. She could wish for everything she wanted now. Back in the real world she wished so many times for a new toy or some nice clothes. But she wasn't going to use this chance on something like that. Besides, this was better than just getting some stuff. This would be pure magic. You could go way further with that even if you would have $1,000,000.   <br>\r\nAnother thought came into Lucy's head. Sure, she was now the Queen of Narnia. At least one of the two queens and one of the four rulers of Narnia. She would like to use this to get something for herself, but on the other hand, she should probably use this to help the other creatures in Narnia. But even if she did wanted to do that, would it work? Sure, her head would say yes, but her heart would say something else. Would this voice follow what you said or what you really desired?  <br>\r\nBut this was the room of undisclosed desires. Desires...  that meant more than one. But did this mean that you could have all your desires come true or only one desire for each person?<br>\r\nLucy remembered a story about a guy who was offered something and signed a contract. Later it seemed he signed a contract with the devil. He signed to sell his soul. He was saved by his sons, but Lucy wondered if her desire would come true or did she have to sacrifice something? Edmund told her once: \"You don't get anything for nothing. Everything has its' price!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy must admit that Edmund wasn't totally wrong about that. In the real world, people normally always wanted something in return. On the other hand, this was Narnia and not the real world. <br>\r\nAll those questions kept going through Lucy's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right, fat beauty?\" The voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?... Eh yeah I'm fine. I was just thinking about some things,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the room again. There was still four brick walls with not one piece of furniture except for the chair she was sitting in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh I was wondering.... is there a catch? I mean, if I told my desire and you gave it to me... do I have to sacrifice something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't. No one needs to sacrifice something. Also some people would use these powers for evil. It was made to only be used by people who are worthy like you. If you're worthy, you don't have to give anything,\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy became a bit nervous. She wanted to know if you could get more than one desire granted, but she didn't want to act all greedy. She had been so once before with The White Witch and it disgusted her that she once had been that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is your desire, fat beauty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's brain worked as fast as it could. She and her siblings would rule Narnia as best as they could. If they only had to desire that, everything would become right that was a bit wrong. Like being too lazy to fight for something. She stood right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My desire is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that? If you want, you could wish for something to help you move around. You can desire as many things as you want,\" the voice said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You mean.... I can wish for multiple things?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Did you want me to grant your desire?\" The voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy then continued to think about this whole concept. She was happy that she could wish for a lot of things without feeling guilty. She wouldn't be greedy at all since she deserved this as the voice said. Many things went through her mind. What did she want? She wanted to eat a lot. That was for sure. She figured that the voice was right. If she was close to being immobile, she could wish for something to help her move around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... I guess I can wait on that desire. But give me a moment to think of a desire,\" Lucy said to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, fat beauty,\" the voice said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy started to think of more possible desires. She wanted to gain weight, of course, but then she thought of something: She always wanted a boyfriend, or in this case, a spouse. She was happy that she was with her siblings, but she also wanted someone that could be a lover to her or a friend. This was definitely a desire for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she also wanted food. She wouldn't mind wishing for a huge pile of food. Both things were tempting to her. She could wish for both of these right now, but then again, she didn't want to be selfish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I desire....\"</span></div></div>",

It sounded like someone opened a window since she heard the wind, but she then noticed even if she heard the wind howl, she didn't feel a draft. The sound was coming from right in front of her. It came from some red, pink, yellow and gold colored light that started to twirl and suddenly, there was a huge plate in front of her. It was a really huge plate with a diameter of at least a yard. The colored light was still howling and twirling. The next moment, a huge pile of food appeared on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you desired, my fat beauty,\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's mouth started to water as she was looking at all the food. Her huge belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's... eat!\" She said and dove at the pile of food, shoving everything into her greedy mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't care since no one was around her except for that voice. She wasn't sure if he could see her. She didn't see any eyes, but also no mouth and still, she heard a voice. He also called her a fat beauty, which meant he did know how she looked. She wondered what the voice exactly was. Had it once been a person or a wizard or was it made or born like just a voice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it taste, fat beauty?\" The voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's mouth was stuffed with food. She pushed so much food into her mouth that her cheeks puffed out. They were so stuffed with food, it looked that they were at the point of snapping. Her mouth was so full, she could hardly close them, let alone, talk. <br>\r\nLucy was busy chewing as fast as she could and swallowing the food. The voice waited patiently until she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all tastes great. Thank you,\" Lucy said before stuffing her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed something. She was eating and eating, but the plate wasn't getting emptier. She decided to test it and quickly started to get as much food in her mouth as possible, but the pile didn't get emptier.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't the pile getting smaller?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. You asked for an unlimited pile of food. So it refills itself whenever you take something from it. Else the plate would become empty and it wouldn't be an unlimited pile of food,\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does make sense,\" Lucy mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Lucy was past the feeling of being full. She had eaten so much food, she felt really sick. But the food tasted all so good. She was moaning in the chair as she was rubbing her huge belly that became bigger because of her binge.<br>\r\nThe plate still full with food was pushed aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have another desire fat beauty? the voice asked. </span></div></div>",

The voice did not respond to her, which made Lucy wonder to herself if she had done something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this, fat beauty?\" the voice asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Lucy asked in a very confused tone.

Whatever you choose, I will grant,\" the voice said to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy knew the voice was right. If she saw how she used to be, she might be very depressed about it or she may not be able to handle it. But then again, maybe she could handle it.

I'm just a magic voice to grand desires to everyone who deserves it. So no I don't know what you mean,\" the voice said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wel,l it's something that always keeps nagging at you in your mind. I know for sure that if I don't see it now, it will keep nagging at me and I finally will run back here to see it anyway. I just wonder what would have happened,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look in the mirror, fat beauty,\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy suddenly saw a huge mirror about a yard long and a yard wide that hadn't been there a minute ago. She looked in it and for a second, she saw her own face, but that soon started to change and she saw herself even fatter then she was now. She held her breath, wondering what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's such a happy day, my Fat White Witch,\" The White Witch said. \"From this day on, no one will be able to rule Narnia except the two of us,\" she continued with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw herself moving forward while being helped by several elves who carried her. Walking was too much effort for her even with help. Besides, why walk if you had elves who carried you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up, you morons. I want to see the prisoners!\" Lucy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Lucy was a bit shocked. Was that how she was acting? She swallowed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves took her to the prison. There, she saw Aslan alone locked in a jail. He looked miserable. They walked further and saw Peter and Susan, both of whom were fattened up. They had huge bellies with rubbing thighs, huge butts, flabby arms, and double chins. Her alter ego looked at them and licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit longer and then you two will be fat enough to be a great meal. I'm sure the two of you will taste great,\" Lucy's alter ego said and started to laugh in an evil tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to the prison of Aslan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you: Well, if I eat you, I will taste all that fur and I don't think that's very tasty. Well, we could of course shave you, but that has to happen another time. For now, The White Witch has plans for you. Besides, I'm hungry. I will go upstairs to eat,\" Lucy said with a wicked smile. </span></div></div>",

The only thing she liked was how much fatter she was in her alter ego. She wanted to be as big or even bigger. Lucy then realized that something was starting to occur. She watched as a group of elves carried in a fat boy that was at least four hundred pounds. Lucy then realized that this boy was her older brother, Peter. What was about to happen was going to shock her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lucy. Remember me? It's Peter, your older brother. Please don't do this,\" Peter cried through his chubby cheeks.

She had watched enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Please stop!\" Lucy said. After she cried that out, the image in the mirror paused and started to slowly dissapear. Lucy fell back, finding herself sitting in a chair. She couldn't stop sobbing. How could she ever eat her brother? Yes, she ate Edmund before, but that wasn't the real Lucy and that was a part of her she never wanted to remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if it harmed you,\" the voice said to Lucy. Lucy slowly started to stop sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that it did. I just can't believe I did that. I mean, I am so thankful that I am back to normal now,\" Lucy said to to voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think many people feel that way. You are in control of yourself,\" the voice said.

Because of his small size and dark fur in the shadows, she didn't see him at first. She was a bit scared of bats because of stories about vampires and tales of bats flying in your hair that she had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D... don't suck m... my blood,\" Lucy said in a panicked tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink your blood?

We bats hated the cold and we hated her, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if Narnia is getting all better now or are there things we need to do?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can look around. I normally sleep during the day, but after almost a few centuries of hibernation, I think I've slept enough and I'm glad I'm able to stretch my wings again. Besides, I would like to eat some insects.

She had felt tired from the afternoon that she had, but she was enjoying everything that had happened so far. The best thing that she was enjoying was the fact that everyday, she was becoming fatter and fatter. All she wanted to do was expand until she popped. She loved the feeling of the fat around her body and the satisfaction of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the animals came back into the room as they brought cart after cart of delicious food, including many kinds of desserts, wonderful arrangements of meat, and even stuff that Lucy had never seen before, but looked like it tasted good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all very much! Can you help me eat this please?\" Lucy asked the animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" One of them said as the animals all started to grab some food and help her eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came up with a good system of making a line and stuffing the food in her face, give her time to chew and enjoy, and then feed her more. Lucy's taste buds seemed like they were on fire as taste after taste gave her more never ending satisfaction. At one point, one of the animals brought a chocolate cake over to her and fed it to Lucy. From the moment Lucy started to chew, she started to let out moans of satisfaction and pleasure. This food was the best thing she had ever had and made her moan orgasmicly. She ate more and more of the food, which was filling her stomach up and giving her more and more pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after an hour of eating, she asked the animals to stop and take a break. She thanked them and gave them some food. When they exited the room, Lucy stared into a nearby mirror: she was even bigger! She even noticed that her face was stained with chocolate and other dessert toppings. She even got some on her hat and some of her dress. She started to lick up her face, grabbed the stained part of her dress and licked it off, and even grabbed her hat and sucked on the stain as if it was juice. Lucy enjoyed the after taste. She was in complete satisfaction as she laid back and drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Then she remembered all that happened like the fight against The White Witch, the war, and of course, their victory. Now, she was Queen of Narnia, or at least one of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror and liked how she looked. She loved being all round and fat with rolls of fat all over her body. She liked it.  <br>\r\nIf she had been a few years older, she would have even found herself sexy. But Lucy was a bit too young to worry about things like looking sexy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit harder to move now,\" She mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the window. The bat didn't come back yet. Well, he said he had been hibernating ever since The White Witch took over. He must have a lot of extra energy since he was finally able to do all things he ever wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go back to that room. I want to be able to move easily. That's my desire,\" Lucy said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled out of bed like a beached whale and slowly waddled while pulling her belly with her. She waddled out of the room. As soon as she entered the hallway, she was exhausted and needed to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this rate, I will reach that room when I'm fifty,\" she sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything wrong, my Queen?\" A fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. But I could use some help to get back to that room,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish is our command,\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck two of his finger in his mouth and whistled. Lucy looked a bit jealous. She tried to do that forever after the first time she saw a doorkeeper call a taxi for a rich lady. But no matter how much she tried, she was never able to whistle that way.<br>\r\nA lot of animals walked towards her and helped her with walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all. I hope I'm not too heavy,\" Lucy said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our pleasure to serve you, Queen Lucy,\" The animals said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinall,y Lucy reached the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. That's fine. You can go now,\" Lucy said while she waddled to the door and entered the empty room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, fat beauty, you came back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Is that a problem?\" Lucy asked in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not. I just wondered why I haven't seen your siblings,\" said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't know if they know about you. I didn't see them after I entered your room the first time. Otherwise, I would have told them. I thought they would have found you by now. The can easily wander through the castle. I can't. I need help for that,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like it if you would be able to move without help?\" asked the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to do that! But I don't want to become skinny. I want to still be so fat, but be able to move easily. Can you do that?\" She asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can do that. If that's what you desire. Too bad I can't grant my own desires. But that's how magic works,\" said the voice. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"All right. I wish for a way to move easily but without losing weight!\"</span></div></div>",

It was just the thing that she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much! This will help out so much,\" Lucy said to the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, fat beauty.

Well, since you are here, do you have anymore desires that you want granted?\" the voice asked Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy began to think about this. What else did she want? There were so many more things that she could ask for, but what? For one thing, she wanted to find love. She may be young, but you can't blame her. Then again, she wanted a friend that could always be with her. That was another possibility. She could even wish for someone to gain weight with her! It hadn't really come across her mind before, but it wasn't a bad idea. It would be nice to have someone gain with her. She kept on thinking.

It's not like I have anything else to do,\" the voice said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy drove out of the room in her new wheelchair. There was a table on it where her huge belly was resting on so it wouldn't crush her legs. She smiled widely and wondered what her siblings would say if they saw her.<br>\r\nShe saw a lot of different rooms. Some empty and some filled with stuff. Then she saw a door that was open. She heard soft mumbling and drove in. It was a big room. There was a nice, big fire burning in the fire place.<br>\r\nSusan was in a corner of the room brushing her hair. Peter was busy playing a game of chess with Mr. Beaver and Edmund watched.<br>\r\nEdmund was the first who saw Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look!

That wheelchair would hold for now but if Lucy would gain much more each day, she would soon be too fat for it. She already gained a lot every day. How much would she have gained in a year? Susan thought about telling this to Lucy, but when she saw how happy Lucy looked, she swallowed her words. When they entered the dining room, they saw a huge table, took place and Lucy wheeled to a place at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking\" started Peter \"that we need to select a group of animals and other living creatures of Narnia to help us rule this. I mean, we don't know so much about Narnia yet. They were born and raised here. I think we need their help,\" Peter continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Susan said. \"We need to learn more about Narnia and treat every creature equally. Anyone who was born and raised here can help us with that,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nominate the beavers and the fox,\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust at that moment, the animals came in with a lot of food. This was probably because they knew Lucy would also eat lunch. They placed all the food at the table and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's first eat. We can't make important decisions on a empty stomach,\" Edmund said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy already started eating. She loved her new live. She thought she might get used to this. Then she remembered the room. She needed to tell them about it. It wouldn't be fair to keep it a secret to them since they had just as much right to enter it and make their desires come true as she had. They would find the room sooner or later anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did anyone of you find that room of desires?\" Lucy asked between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. This place is huge. It will take years before you know every room here. Now I know why sleeping beauty never had been in that room in the top of the tower until she became 16,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have a lot to do before we can rule like find other creatures that can help us rule. I must admit the beavers and the fox helped us and fought brave in the war. So the three of them will help us!\" Peter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i haven't told you about the room. It's really special,\" Lucy said.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"We have hundreds of rooms here.

Lucy was so involved with eating that she heard little bits of the conversation between her siblings. As her appetite increased, her attention decreased. Her siblings noticed that she wasn't paying attention after a while, but continued to talk amongst each other, not wanting to disturb Lucy.

You know that power is still inside you!\" The White Witch said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy immediately tried to get up, but she couldn't as she noticed she was weighed down. She looked down at her body and realized why: she was immobile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" Lucy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did nothing but train you, help you, and accept you. You can't fight the evil. Come back to me,\" The White Witch said as she moved her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sight and out of mind, Turkish delights appeared out of thin air. Lucy tried to force her lips shut, but the Turkish delights found their way into Lucy's mouth. After a long time of resisting, Lucy unwillingly swallowed. She was immediately overpowered by a satisfying taste, which made the flow of Turkish delights begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back to me,\" The White Witch would repeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short amount of time, Lucy gave in and swallowed any Turkish delight that came to her mouth. With each swallow, Lucy's body would change. She would put on at least one hundred pounds, her clothes would expand, her hat would increase by size of fitting and the size of the balls on it, her boots would change shoe sizes to fit her foot fat, and her bed would even become bigger. The cycle continued for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lucy opened her eyes, noticing that she was now randomly a blob of immobile fat, which made her feel blissful. It was as if the dead White Witch had drugged her mind and cast Lucy under her old spell. Lucy closed her eyes again. This time, the dream began to fade as she could feel herself begin to wake up.</span></div></div>",

It shows just how fat she is getting. She is still too embarrassed to call for animals though. So she decides to try and get to her chair alone. She wants to ask for help from someone, she is afraid the white witch is going to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoots herself to the edge of her bed. Her belly is hanging over her knees as she reached as far along it as she can and gives it a pat. She's still hungry though. She giggles as she things about how she cant even reach all of her own tummy. It's forcing her thighs so far apart, she is just so big now. She leans back and swings forward with all her strength, putting her hands on her knees for leverage. She leans forward and let's the weight of her upper body drag her to her feet. She stands still panting for a few minutes. Its so much work for her. Her legs are starting to tire just standing still. She takes two small unbalanced steps and plops into her wheelchair. 'I think I've grown even bigger overnight' she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way to find on of her brothers or sister's. She finds them all in the dining room, waiting for breakfast. She tells them that she had a dream but they dismiss it. For some reason they just wont take her seriously. She's young and fat so she must be stupid seems to go through their minds. She decides to ignore the dream and stuff her face instead, hoping food will make her feel better like it usually does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to eat more than ever. She feels full but just keeps stuffing her face. She loves feeling fatter. Her siblings are amazed at how much she can eat. They wonder how it must feel being buried under all that heavy fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating more than ever, Lucy feels</span></div></div>",

He kept on walking down the halls of the castle, seeing a countless number of doors and windows. Everywhere he looked, he was overcome by the beauty of the castle around him. It sure was a magnificent specticle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering for what seemed like forever, Edmund stopped in front of a big, tall door. He had a feeling from all that Lucy said that this was the room that she kept on talking about. At first, Edmund felt scared in a way since he didn't know what to expect. But he figured if Lucy entered and came out happier, it should be alright to enter. Cautiously, Edmund opened the door. As he opened it, he began to walk inside as if something was pulling him into the room. He didn't know what was coming over him, but he was gaining more courage with each step until the door was shut behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Edmund,\" A voice said out loud, scaring Edmund for a brief moment. This was the voice that had talked to Lucy earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? And how do you know my name?\" Edmund asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am all knowing.

They climbed to the highest point in the area and stared down at the scenery of the ocean that spanned for countless miles.  The salt water mixed with the air creating a scent that was both foreign and refreshing to their canine senses.  The ocean breeze was cool and only bearable thanks to the warm weather.  Balto turned to Jenna.  \"Well, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it,\" she replied breathing the salt air in deeply.  It's the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, only the second most beautiful thing I've ever seen,\" replied Balto smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really,\" said Jenna.  \"Then what's the first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking at it,\" commented Balto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna didn't realize what he was talking about at first, thinking he was referring to the landscape before them,  but then realized he was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't realize you felt that way about me?\" she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do and I know how you feel about me.  So please give me your answer; I want to be with you.  Will you be with me, forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna stepped back and averted her eyes, much to Balto's dismay.  Jenna truely did have feelings for Balto; that was a given.  However, she had a think for fat dogs and would have loved to snuggle up to a nice fat dog ona cold night.  Still, such a thought didn't feel right in words.  She didn't want to say something to Balto feeling he might see it as wierd or too much of a request.  She had always planned on telling him one day, but she always lost her nerve.  Now, she was at the pivotal point where she had to tell him before they could ever consider taking their relationship further.  Jenna turned back to Balto and...</span></div></div>",

For the longest time he had been probably a bit underweight before he had become welcome around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made the trek to town thinking about what he was going to do.  He had never considered putting on weight thinking that would work against him and now all he could think about was doing whatever he could to please Jenna.  The trouble was how was he going to do it.  If he tried hunting for food he'd never be able to take down anything big enough to help him gain and he'd only lose the weight from all the work it would require.  Not only that, it would get harder as he gained weight.  He also considered getting handouts from the folks in town.  He often got them now that he was so well respected, but that also had its problems.  A few treats here and there would only go so far.  He'd need a large and constant supply to allow any difference in his waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacking his brain over this jsut gave him a headache.

She was hardly cold or tired to need it, but she just wanted to fall asleep so she could wake up and pretend everything that happened was just a bad dream.  She was certain that Balto hated her now or lost interest.  There's no way she could expect him to get fat just because she had a thing for fat pooches.  Time and time again she had fantasized Balto and imagined him running towards her with a belly down to his knees jiggling with every step he took.  She had even hoped he might put on some weight after becoming such a big hero, but the little he did get put him at an average dog's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer continued pondering kept her from sleeping.  Then she heard a tap on the window.  She looked and saw it was Balto.  She stood up fast froze, not sure why he came here.  Was he going to tell her off for her weird fantasies of fat dogs or that he wanted to break up.  She was ready for the worst, but wasn't sure what to expect since Balto didn't look angry or upset at her.  In fact, he looked happy.  He slipped into the house and looked into Jenna's eyes with sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jenna said.  She had an inkling to what he meant, but she was in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" Balto continued.  \"I'll get fat for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" said Jenna happily.  She was ready to hug him, but stopped abruptly.  \"No.  It would be selfish for you to do that to yourself for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to do it.  To make you happy,\" he explained.  \"I love you and will do anything to make you happy.  The way I see it, getting fat would be the greatest thing in the world if it would allow me to be closer to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears dripped down Jenna's eyes.  She doubted anyone else would have been able to say those same words to her and really mean them with so much conviction.  \"Oh, Balto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only,\" interrupted Balto.  \"I'm kind of at a loss for how I'm going to put on the weight.  You must have thought of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have,\" said Jenna.  Her tone changed to a very passionate one.  It had quite a seductive tone.  \"Just do as I say and I'll get you out of shape in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sounds great,\" commented Balto.  Seeing Jenna's eagerness to do this unleashed was a little scary, but he had to admit it was making him quite excited.  \"So, when do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna smiles and said...</span></div></div>",

Jenna let herself out of the house and the two walked down about one hundred yards until they reached a storage hangar. Balto had seen this place but never knew what was in it. In a way, he was excited that this would please Jenna, and maybe even himself. Jenna and Balto walked around to the backside of the hangar to where the garbage cans were. They went behind the trashcans and knocked down a piece of wood that blocked a hole. the two dogs crawled through the hole, which led them into the hangar. When Balto entered, he opened his mouth in suprise. There was a bunch of stuff in this place, but what really suprised him was that there was a whole section right by them that had shelves and shelves full of foods and meats. There was enough food to feed a whole town for a week!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this a while ago. I think this should be plenty of food. Are you hungry?\" Jenna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto was about to say no, when all of a sudden, he felt his stomach rumble and jive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am!\" Balto said to Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up!\" Jenna yelled to Balto, who immediately jumped in and started eating the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto, being the wolf he was, started with the meats. He tore into a pound of steaks that was right by him. He didn't stop tearing the steak apart as he munched and munched the steak down bite by bite. Jenna watched in amazement as she was suprised to see Balto liking the food this much. After eating the steaks, Balto moved to eating at least ten chicken legs. This was easy for him since the chicken was on the bone. After that, Balto moved to something that was sweet. He grabbed a few boxes of twinkies packed on a low shelf and started digging into them. He knew this wasn't healthy, but he actually really loved the taste of the delectible, sweet treat. After going through a few boxes, Balto stopped to take a break. Jenna walked over to him to see the results with Balto....</span></div></div>",

To her dismay the only thing that fit such characteristics was the bulge Balto had in his stomach from all his eating.  Jenna was annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his unhappy lover he aske, \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still too thin,\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too thin?\" he asked.  \"You can't expect me to gain any wait after I just ate.  I'd need to digest and even then it would probably take months.  I've been active so long that it will probably take even longer before I show any signs of gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's why we're going to do whatever we can to speed it up,\" she explained before dragging a strange device out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto eyed it with curiousity and a slight twinge of fear.  It had a bunch of straps that look like they were meant to bind one's arms or in his case his front parts to his sides.  Then it had a device like a muzzle with a tube attached to it.  It was quite obvious what its purpose was, but the words slipped off his tongue.  \"What is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little contraption the humans use on the dogs on occassion.  It's when they need to prepare the dogs for long trips and can't carry a lot of extra food.  It actually force feeds them well beyond their limits so they pack on the pounds fast.  That way they can live off the fat in case they run out of food.  It's actually a pretty old device and with more practical modes of transportation such an archaic device as this no longer serves any other purpose than carrying dust.  This is probably the only one that is still functional and I figured, why not put it to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Balto, fearfully.  \"What if I don't like it?  It isn't like I can stop it once I'm tied up and the way you are now, you'd probably keep pumping food into me till I'm as big as a whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it would be a big turn on,\" admitted Jenna, lust in her voice that she really wanted to try this.  \"But, I'll make a deal with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal?\" repeated Balto, suspiciously.  \"Why?  Couldn't you just force me to use it or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't want you getting uncomfortable with the weight gain or you probably won't have a sweet and lovey disposition about it.  A sad and grumpy fat dog wouldn't be nearly as fun.  This way, I at least give you a bit of a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what's the deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I'll give you a daily goal and if you can reach it then you don't have to use it, otherwise you have to use it an hour for each pound you failed to gain.  You'll have all the time you need to gain the weight, but once you are too full to eat anymore that's when I take over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds simple enough.  How much do I need to gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how much do you weigh now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 110 lbs. now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nice clean number to start with.  Okay, then, how about you're goal start small.  How about a five pound gain to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five pounds?\" questioned Balto.  \"There's no way I can gain that much weight so early on.  I mean, I just ate all that food now and I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Jenna lustfully.  \"Full already and I doubt you've gained a pound yet.  Looks like you get the feeder already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto was worried.  It was true he had quite a bit to eat so early, but now if he didn't stuff himself further he'd be forced to eat even more and for five hours at that.  What was he going to tell Jenna?</span></div></div>",

That was reason enough for him to bite into another juicy piece of meat.  This disappointed Jenna who was looking forward to seeing the device in action, but as long as Balto did his part she had no room to complain.  Besides even if he somehow met his goal today she'd make sure he'd get the feeder tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Balto finished the meat he was working on he felt his stomach groaning from the pain of fullness.  As he stopped for a breather he heard the soft but easily recognizable sound of the feeder.  Jenna had taken a step closer to him with it in her maw ready to put it on him when he couldn't eat any more.  That started Balto eating again.  Balto never expected Jenna to be the alpha dog in the relationship, but he was completely at her mercy now.  Even if he decided he'd want to stop and forget the whole thing he doubted that Jenna would let him.  He was far too full to fight back and she'd stuff him till he couldn't move from where she left him.  All that was left for him was to keep eating and hold her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna grinned as she watched Balto consume at least three times the amount of food he'd normally eat, She knew exactly what was going through his mind, having planned this for so long and considered the position her mate would be in.  She knew he was afraid she would fatten him up the moment she was given a reason.  It didn't matter if she used the feeder on him or not.  Just by shaking it was enough to get him back to eating.  She shook it every once in a while to scare him into eating faster.  His stomach that had started slim then filled out to his normal full sized was starting to become distended, bulging down and at the sides.  It was just the food, not yet digested, but it was neccessary for Balto to get used to eating large meals and stretch his stomach to be able to contain more food.  Years of being underweight had left it quite small.  She doubted if he ever got spoiled by a human at least not until he became a hero.  She was going to make sure to make him feel like a king.  To love the pampering and lay around all day awaiting her to feed him and all the while he would gain more and more weight.  He would be so cuddly adn cute like a chubby puppy waiting for mommy to feed him and rub his belly.  Just the thought of having such a wonderful mate entralled Jenna to no end.  But for now, she was going to have to make sure that Balto got used to the feedings, by any means necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to watch Balto fill his already full belly, desperate to avoid the feeder until...</span></div></div>",

True it was not fat yet, but if she kept him eating like this, he'd gain in no time.  She brought over a scale to see if he met his quota for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you started out at 110 lbs. before we started.  You need to reach 115 lbs. or you know what is going to happen,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna helped Balto to his feet so that he could stand on the scale. They watched as the counter spun quickly past the 50 lbs. mark.  It slowed down as 75 lbs. was hit, but made it past 100 lbs. and then 110 lbs.

Even if the stuffed pooch wasn't a dog of his word and going to go through with it, he was far too full to resist. He just laid back as Jenna sat him down and went to get the feeder.  She held it out before him and instinctively, he whimpered, feeling he wasn't going to enjoy this in the least. Jenna grinned seeing Balto act like such a little pup, she found it attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay dear,\" she cooed to comfort him. \"This isn't as bad as it seems. It'll just help you eat more so that you can pack on some more, beautiful fat.\" With that said, she began to strap the device onto Balto. She made sure each strap was secure, but not uncomfortable for him to wear. It took a lot longer than she expected, especially since this was her first time ever using it and she wasn't entirely sure how it worked entirely, but when it was done she began filling the food intake valve with a variety of foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was filled, she turned it on and it whirrled to life. All the food quickly got chopped up and liquefied through a series of blades. It was then pumped through a tube that fed straight into Balto's maw. He felt it fill his mouth and down his throat. The mix of the different meats covered his taste buds and made it easy and enjoyable to eat. Still, it didn't take away the fact that he was so full and let out moans of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, baby,\" said Jenna in a motherly tone. \"I'll make you feel all better.\" She began to rub his belly to calm his pain and get him to relax. They gazed into each other's eyes happily. Balto was happy that Jenna was happy and Jenna was happy that she was finally going to have her fat doggy to love and be happy about getting fed. Jenna continued to give Balto a belly rub on his ever expanding and rounding out stomach as the time passed. She only stopped when she had to add in more food to the feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto was afraid that the feeder was going to be terrifying once it began and feel like an eternity before it ended, but he had become so relaxed he was actually disappointed as the time came to an end.

The first thing he noticed was that he felt the bulge in his mid section. His gut was very prominant now. It was still mostly food, but it had never looked so large. \"If we keep on feeding that belly of yours, it will start to grow rounded and wider and so will the rest of you darling,\" said Jenna, whose voice was like that of a siren, overcoming any rational thoughts he had at the moment.

It was so soft and wonderful and added to his fatigue he closed his eyes and was out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some time later when Balto awoke by the sun shining through a hole in the ceiling.  He rubbed his eyes and got on all four paws to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel refreshed,\" yawned Balto no longer feeling the extreme fullness from yesterday.  He took a few steps forward when he felt a strange sensation.  Looking back he realized his belly was still quite large despite feeling he had digested  since yesterday.  He gave it a poke and quickly realized it wasn't food at least not anymore.  It was a think layer of fat padded to his frame.  It wasn't much, but because he was so used to being thin he was able to notice it.  Smiling happily, knowing Jenna would be happy he made progress he thought of going to find her.  But he also considered she might not like him being out and about looking for her.  The exercise would cause him to burn the calories out of his system.  He also had a second option.

The shed will still mostly full even after he had been stuffed silly the night before.  He started munching down a few steaks that looked appetizing, but soon felt himself filling up all to fast.  He stopped once he finished them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be full already,\" Balto thought.  He thought he made more progress than this.  He knew it was natural that he wouldn't be hungry after eating so much the night before, but if he didn't learn to eat more he won't gain as much progress.  He thought this dilemma over for a while.  The odors of meat wafting in the air entered his nose and subconsciously made him lick his chops.  Then Balto came up with an idea to help induce hunger on himself.  He quickly began gathering the variety of meats from the shelves and started piling them together on the ground.  When he felt he gathered enough he relaxed by the pile and let the mix of aromas dance their way into his sinuses.  The scent of food began activating his canine instincts, but he didn't his best to ignore then for now, only serving to entice them further.  He couldn't help but salivate from how delicious the meat smelled, but he had to wait for the right time.  His resistance began to show results soon as his stomach made a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds felt like an eternity as Balto waited.  He couldn't take his eyes off the pile before him.  His nose kept sniffing at the meat and bringing a fresh blast of the aroma to stir his growing hunger even further.  The growling continued to grow louder and Balto was growing more and more eager to eat the food, but he still resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I'm nut hungry enough yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just watched the meat, sniffed the meat, salivated over the meat, and waited...  Waiting... Waiting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his stomach grumbled loudly.  He felt so famished like he hadn't eaten in a month; the wait seemed that long.  He stopped resisting and started scarfing it down, finding his induced hunger made the meat taste all the juicer.  The pile was devoured in a fraction of the time he waited, but it wasn't enough.  Balto searched the shelves for more food eager to satiate his hunger.  As he continued to devour the food it returned his belly to its spherical shape, albeit nowhere near as big as it had been after the feed, but he still wasn't done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Balto was continuing his breakfast he noticed Jenna was out and about.  She didn't appear to be looking for him, but then again it was early and she may have assumed he was still asleep.  Balto considered going to see her, but he didn't want to risk losing this momentum he built up.</span></div></div>",

If anything, she'd be disappointed to find he was so easily distracted from eating when he promised to become obese. She'd just send him back, but he'd not likely keep his drive going so strong. With his decision made, he returned his full attention to all the food still awaiting his salivating maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delicious flavors swirled together, encouraging him to eat more along with the smells that his nose had been accustomed to smell every few seconds. With each thing that slid down his throat, it made his stomach droop lower and lower. Before his very eyes, the food vanished bit by bit until there was not a scrap for him to nibble on and Balto felt his hunger hadn't completely dissipated, but was satisfied enough that it wouldn't bother him while he sat and digested the food. He considered going out in search of more food, but he didn't have any idea. He could end up searching for a long time and burn off too many calories and eating so much drained his energy a lot more than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never needed to rest so early in the day before,\" said Balto yawning. \"Not since I was a pup anyway. I wonder if I'll be like this all the time once I've grown even bigger. Will I just laze around all day only to move if I need to eat or cuddle with Jenna?\" The idea, at first, seemed a little scary since he was normally very active and he could already sense his behavior was becoming more sloth-like. Then thinking more about how happy Jenna would be made him think it wouldn't be so bad at all. He gave a few more yawns before falling to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, dear,\" came a voice Balto knew without a doubt was Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto opened his eyes and replied. \"Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, it's the middle of the afternoon,\" she informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit before Balto recalled that he just had a nap and got to his feet. He then saw that his recent binge was paying off as his belly and legs had more meat on them than before. Jenna seemed to notice this as well, but she was probably clued in when she saw the food was all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you've been doing everything you can to make me happy,\" said Jenna with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad you're happy, but now I'm out of food,\" Balto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already got more food prepared, but I couldn't carry it all here since it would draw suspicion,\" Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go get it,\" said Balto licking his chops. He was glad at his training. He was already hungry for more and confident that he'd reach the chubby state before long and more onto fat just as quick. \"Lead the way,\" Balto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna walked out through the entrance and Balto followed her, but he only poked his head out when he realized his stomach was stuck inside. It had gotten too big since his last meal and now he couldn't push it through. He never considered this and he didn't know if Jenna did or not. Either way, he couldn't follow her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck,\" he called to Jenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the trouble with gaining,\" she explained. \"You won't be able to get out of places you normally could squeeze through with ease. We'll have to make sure that you don't get stuck in somewhere a lot harder to get out of. At least this is just some old wooden boards. I'll have you out in no time,\" Jenna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto was glad that Jenna was already on top of this, but he was surprised when he discovered...</span></div></div>",

He may have been willing to get fat for her, but he never prepared himself to face the other dogs about this obese thing. He never expected to spend his time with anyone other than Jenna. Now it was going to get around to everyone and they were going to get a big laugh when they saw he was also stuck from his girth. As he thought of this, he covered his face with his paws and waited for the inevitable humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when they arrived, he didn't get what he expected. All the dogs in the kennel had gathered with Jenna even though he doubted she'd need more than a couple of helpers. They all looked quite ecstatic and many barked a cheer at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" asked Balto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you not know?\" asked one of the dogs. \"You're living the dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" asked Balto, who was just as confused as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you get it?\" asked another dog. \"Any dog would kill to be in your shoes to be cared for and fed to immobility,  to be pampered and fed to that degree. It is paradise for any dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" asked Balto. He looked at everyone's faces and there wasn't one that would make him think they were playing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" said the first dog. \"We'll get you out in a jiffy and bring you back to our place. You won't be disturbed there and more so, you won't have to worry about getting stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough chit-chat, men,\" barked Jenna like a general in an army. \"Get him out of there before he starts to lose weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs barked to accept the order and began pushing at the wall, their combined strength knocking a few boards loose and giving Balto plenty of room to walk through. They then ran for the kennel, escorting Balto and Jenna all the way. Once there, they began getting to work, setting up a place for Balto from a bed to some stuff Jenna had requested to help her keep track of Balto's gains like a calender to record his weight at the start and end of the day and a camera so she could get a visual image of his gaining. Everyone was so excited for his success and they helped with removing any lingering fears. Balto absolutely couldn't wait to pack on the pounds.</span></div></div>",

At first, Balto didn't know if he could handle it, but Jenna rubbed his belly and melted his cares away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took barely any time at all before Balto finished and his stomach was tight from being so fully stuffed as he was.

It was a practice in these parts to carefully feed the dogs just enough to satisfy their hunger and never more. Getting table scraps wasn't uncommon, but they were never given much. This was to keep them from stretching their stomachs and getting used to larger meals. This way they wouldn't desire as much food should a bad blizzard come and cut off supplies to the village. Now Balto was being fed more food than any of the other dogs ever dreamed of eating. His stomach used to be what one could consider the biggest of all the dogs in town or even any dog for miles around. Now, however, it was one of, it not the biggest and only getting bigger as more food was forced into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was pretty bad as he felt so sore in his torso as it stretched. Even Jenna's belly rub was doing little to sooth it. Balto was certain he'd bust at any second when he stomach couldn't handle any more food, but the previous meals he had allowed his stomach to reduce its resistance to retain its shape allowing it to stretch much easier now as it grew larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the feeding was doing wonders for Balto's fattening figure, it was also once again draining his strength fast.  His eyes grew heavy as sleep was taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep now dear,\" cooed Jenna urging him to sleep despite the food still filling him. \"Once this meal is over and done with and you digest you will see that this sort of treatment is no longer a punishment. It will be a pleasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto didn't know what she meant or if he could agree with her about it, but he couldn't keep himself awake any longer and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

He was much too big to fit in any of the houses, but even on the coldest of days, he was insulated by layers of thick, warm fat to keep him so hot, he panted if the wind wasn't howling. The other dogs and even the people hugged close to him for warmth, but the only one allowed to climb on top of him and nuzzle his head was Jenna. Each day, she'd navigate his body and admire his endless obesity. It was the most wonderful thing to her, and watching him eat enough food each day that could feed an army of dogs was just icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt night, she'd whisper how she loved every inch of him more and more and how excited she was to see how big he'd get in another week, another month, and another year. Whatever she said made time fly to that point and Blato just grew exponentially larger soon outgrowing the town and then some. His body spread across the entire area and was visible from space. In time, he became known worldwide as Balto Of The North since he took up so much space there. Balto himself couldn't be happier and he wanted to stay like that forever. But suddenly, the world around him began to vanish as he started to stir.</span></div></div>",

Most of the time he was there to statisfy her desires but now was one of the days where Jenna needed to find another way fo get her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed it for another two hour to keep her urge under control but then she could take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go!\" She panted and got up. \"If i dont do it i will loose my mind in the next hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the house and headed to one of the factroys down at Nomes docks. She knew a special way to get what she wanted the most at the momend.<br>\r\nA few minutes later she reached the place.<br>\r\nIt was a small yard beneath one of the factorys where she knew no one whould see her because there where no footprints in the snow. At least no fresh ones and the last snowfall was two days ago.<br>\r\nSo Jenna entered the small yard and closed the gate, then she went to a pipe that came out of the wall. It was more than one feet long and four inch wide.<br>\r\nJenna didnt knew what that pipe did or whats its funchtion was, but she knew that the pipe started to vibrate at regular intervalls and that was all she wanted to know.<br>\r\nShe layed on her back so that her pussy aimed straight for the pipe. Then she slid back and pushed it into her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh...\" She moaned as the pipe entered her body. \"I forgot how huge that thing was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the pipe had entered Jennas body it started to vibrate for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...!\" Jenna gasped as her butt twitched. \"And i forgot how extreme this thing vibrates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jenna didnt ex\u00fcected what happened next.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the vibrations of the pipe didnt stop anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It never did that before...\" Jenna moaned. \"But i'm not complaining, no way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the vibrations became more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhh, dont stop!\" Jenna panted as she started to rock her hips back into the pipe. \"I'm close! So close! More! MORE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as Jenna was seconds away from her releasing orgasm, the pipe started to vibrate so hard that she almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Fwoooooooooooshhhhhhhhhhh!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna gasped as she felt a sudden pressure inside her vaginal passage that quickly moved into her belly and she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" She gasped as she saw something shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was inflating like a balloon at an alarming rate.<br>\r\nThe pipe in her pussy was something like a pressure relief vent for air and it was just releasing a huge amount of air straight into Jennas belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inflating!\" Jenna moaned as her belly grew to the size of a beachball. \"I'm fucking inflating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a paw on her rapidly inflating belly feeling how it pulsed and creaked to make room for all the air.<br>\r\nJenna continued to inflate and as she reached a size of 4 feet she came hard.<br>\r\nBut with that it wasnt over.<br>\r\nAs Jennas orgasm faded she focused on her growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to do something.\" She panted. \"I need to get off the pipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she started to wiggle the pipe out of her body but her still inflating belly limited her movements extremely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nghhh...\" She grunted. \"Gah... I... i can't move! Damn it, i'm stuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat realization forced Jenna to stay where she was and take it.<br>\r\nHer belly continued to inflate and bot bigger and bigger.<br>\r\nJenna pushed her front paws into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tight like a drum.\" She stated. \"I wonder how much more i can hold...\" She smiled. \"Well, i will find out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that her belly reached 5 feet and was still growing.<br>\r\nJenna now noticed that the swelling of her belly slowed down but the pressure was still increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, i think i'm full!\" She gasped as the pressure in her belly grew. \"Ohhhh, please stop soon or i will pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the air still flowed and her belly still grew.<br>\r\nJenna got bigger and bigger and there was no sign that it whould stop soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jenna felt a sharp pain on the top of her belly.<br>\r\nShe pressed her paws down on her belly in a helpless attempt to stop the inflation but it was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna blow!\" She hissed and gritted her teeth. \"If i keep inflating like this i will blow like a overinflated balloon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain got bigger and so did her belly.<br>\r\nIt swelled to 6 feet, and was on the verge of 7 as Jenna whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please dont let it end like this!\" She prayed. \"I dont wanna pop like a balloon! Please! No more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the pain in her belly got extreme, her belly pulsed Jenna came again and passed out.<br>\r\nAnd just in that second the pipe stopped to fill her with air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna was unconscious, still inflated like a balloon and the pipe was still in her pussy.<br>\r\nAfter nearly half an hour Jenna woke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...\" She moaned. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed her huge belly and her memory came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, shit, i'm still stuck here!\" She grunted and tried to get up again but failed like at her first attempt. \"I just hope that pipe dont releases any more air. I#m not sure if i can hold any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she pushed her paws into her belly and was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She gasped. \"It's soft! My belly has still the same size but its not hard anymore!\" She pushed her paws a few times into her belly. \"Hmmm, it seems that it stretched a lot since i passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pipe started to vibrate again! Another release was coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, no!\" Jenna yipped. \"If i get another load like this i will really blow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use. The pipe vibrated again and then Jenna felt how more air flowed into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooo...!\" Jenna screamed as her belly started to inflate again. \"I dont wanna blow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept inflating and her belly grew and grew and grew.<br>\r\nJenna couldnt believe what was happening here.<br>\r\nShe looked at her belly as it reaced 10 feet, and she hoped that her belly could hold all the air that whould come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm huge!\" Jenna moaned. \"Come on girl, you can hold it! You can get bigger than this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to relax so that her belly could get bigger and it worked. Jennas belly easyly reached 15 feet and was still groing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" Jenna demanded. \"If i can't stop it, i want to take it all, so give me all you have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to move her hips again. She really wanted it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Is that all you got?\" She asked as she humped the pipe. \"Make me bigger damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jenna got bigger.<br>\r\nMuch bigger!<br>\r\nShe kept inflating till her belly was nearly 36 feet big and as she finally stopped to inflate she was a bid sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, done already?\" She asked. \"Well, i guess i had my fun. I came 12 times while i was inflating, so i guess its okay to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her belly with her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Balto can see me with that belly.\" She smiled. \"I wonder what he whould say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it whould be something like: \"How did you get so huge?\" or \"What a sight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna looked around.

We could get caught!\" Kodi said looking at the weight Dusty had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Kodi, why would there be so much meat in here that could feed the town for years? Plus, if they have so much meat in here, would it go bad if it just stays in for the entire season?\" Dusty raised a good point as there was lots of meat that had an expiration date March in the current year but still was hesitant in joining with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we have to be in shape if we are in need to pull the sled and besides don't we have kibble the humans give us for our meals?\" Kodi countered the reasoning Dusty presented to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I heard kibble doesn't give the protein a working dog needs from what I heard.\" Dusty said to Kodi in which he replied back. \"And who told you that?\" \"Dipsy.\" \"What?! Dispy doesn't do much as she's just Mr. Conner's pet and we are sled dogs!\" Kodi pointed out the fact that taking advice from a dog like Dipsy won't do much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your part wolf from your dad's side and since dogs and wolves are related, it's much more natural for them to eat meat than what the humans provide?\" Dusty also brought up that fact that made Kodi second thinking his stance but was a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" Kodi tried to muster up his thoughts till Dusty brought up another fact. \"And I heard that storing up fat will also keep you warm form the whether we're having today right?\" and just like that a blizzard was forming outside of the shed where Kodi started to shiver a bit as the breeze came in quick that the door in the outside closed on it self shut leaving only the two of them alone inside of the meat locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will it be than Kodiak?\" Dusty said into his ear as his stomach also growled at him for missing out on his meal in the afternoon as well.</span></div></div>",

You ca-\" Kodi is cut out when Dusty whacks him in the head with a thick meat leg so hard that he stumbles to the ground. \"Sorry Kodiak, but you leave me with no choice.\" She said to him as Kodi's vision blurs out into darkness losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been an hour since he was knocked out but Kodi finds himself in a sitting position on the floor of the meat locker shed with his legs tied up (hind legs on the floor and his fore legs tied to planks of wood in like a make shift chair) only with his sled dog harness on him that's tied to a pillar wood stand where his back lay against making sure he can't escape along with his thin white under belly exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKodi was trying to remember what had happen as if it were a strange dream he had but to his dismay this was realty. \"Ah finally your awake.\" Kodi turned to his left direction to see Dusty walking or should we say wobbling to him as Dusty now looked more fat as the sliver creamy under belly of hers jiggled a bit in comparison to when Kodi saw her she only looked like she was pregnant with pups (If only Kodi wished that were the case than it would be understandable for her to eat a lot).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUSTY! CUT THIS OUT NOW!\" Kodi shouted at her to which she said. \"Come on Kodi, think of this as date?\" she said as her nose was against Kodi's close enough for a nose boop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date? Since when does a date involved one of the two lovers forcing the other to EAT!?\" \"Don't be like that, I am generously feeding you, look your bones are visible on your chest.\" Dusty putted up a paw to him so that he can feel how his skin was so close to the rib cage of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I am not that hungry!\" He protested but his stomach still growled at him for denying his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you stomach disagrees with you, here we can go with two options,\" Dusty said as Kodi listens to her suggestion. \"I can just hand you food for you to consume as your belly gets bigger, but if you don't comply, I am going to have force you with this device here.\" Dusty walked over to reveal a machine with a hose attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh, Wh-what is that?!\" Kodi muttered in fear of what he saw before him. \"That,\" Dusty turned her head towards it. \"its a food capacitor, what it does is it grinds the meat into bits of mush where it's easy to sallow down.\" she than looks back at the helpless wolf-husky, Kodi had no choice but to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay okay... Ju-just don't overdue it Dusty.\" Kodi muttered those words in defeat as Dusty's tail was wagging from her big behind. \"Once you get this big like I am, you will feel so much pleasure.\" as she goes get a meat leg from a plie nearby, she comes to Kodi with only the leg of the bone as Kodi than chews on it and swallows it down and took another bite after that repeating that again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes of Kodi eating the scraps of meat where he just finished his sixth try, his stomach was starting to bulge out a bit with a naval belly button showing itself as Dusty saw it. \"Hey look you got a cute belly button on your tummy!\" Dusty pointed with her paw to show Kodi. \"Dusty, I think I am about full here, I don't think I can take much more.\" Kodi groans as he felt like he ate 5 bowls of kibble. \"So it's the food capacitor than?\" When Dusty mentioned the food capacitor he immediately took back what he said and Dusty gladly went back to get another scrap of meat and Kodi took another bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kodi was now on his 13th try of eating a spare rib, Kodi's belly was at a size of a beach ball as it was full of food, Kodi felt overwhelm as this was too much for a meal a dog could eat in a day. \"Dusty, I th-thi-think I can't... eat much..more...please stop for a mome-\" Kodi fell to a food coma sleep, Dusty still wanting Kodi to be fat like herself respected his wish as he need more time to digest the food in him which just leaves Dusty the perfect opportunity to strap the food capacitor to his maw and muzzle and after that went back on packing on pounds as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Kodi woke up from his food coma slumber as he flet his body was different as his chest felt like flab moobs along with his legs now felt flabby than a dog's or a wolf's athletic muscle along with his rump felt bigger and heavy as well, all of the digesting has put him in this condition and his belly now flet big but still at the size of a beach ball and his sled dog harness was still on him and he notice his maw was strapped to a hose to the food capacitor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm! Dufmh!\" Kodi tried to speak but couldn't make the words proper instead. \"Don't worry now Kodi, your belly has just digested all that food you ate so you have more room for more.\" Dusty said as she was right next to the food capacitor and Dusty was also different as well as now her silver belly is bigger as it touched the ground and was twines the size than Kodi's, Dusty than activates the food capacitor as meat was grinding into mush and moved it's way to the hose leading to Kodi's maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUMMPH-\" Kodi tried to yell for help but was no use as there was nothing he can do as the mush meat went in his mouth and forced down his gullet with more and more came in. Dusty move a bit as she can with her belly just dragging on the floor, only her pudgy hind legs could move as her belly kept her fore legs up from the ground, wobbling her way to Kodi as he tried to get this strap off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kodi, you can't fight it, just let it in it will be alright.\" Dusty told him in a soothing tone as Kodi had tears in his eyes when he looked at her as he again felt his belly swollen up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just see how big your belly can get till that harness on you bursts off.\" Kodi's belly began to moan and groan at how full of mush meat was in there it was 3 times the size of a beach ball of a white creamy belly and the sled dog harness getting tighter and tighter on Kodi's belly till.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal pin of the sled dog harness bursts off of Kodi's belly like a bullet straight into the food capacitor that shut it down, Kodi took a sign of relief as there was no more mush meat going down in his gullet as Dusty took the strap off of him which fell on to Kodi's belly that was now at the same size of Dusty's sending ripples of fat on the wolf husky belly before sliding down to the floor, Now the ropes tide to Kodi's legs were also free as he could move a bit again but he couldn't move at all as he was heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dusty, why?\" said now that it looks like it has been done with him not just being fat but morbidly obese. \"Because I wanted to show you my love and affection to you Kodi.\" Kodi was some what confused form the answer and was going to say something back until he felt like something coming out from his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BELCH* Kodi burped a rupptly which made Dusty giggle at him and Kodi looked at her just seeing how her giggles also sent ripples on her belly, just seeing that made Kodi blushed as he realized just how beautiful she looked being fat. Both of their bellies made nosises together as if singing in harmony. \"So how does it feel?\" Dusty said to him as she rubs her paw on Kodi belly which just felt so good. \"Well uh.\" Kodi said as he couldn't come up with words but he was starting to get the hang of it as his big belly just felt so soft like a dog bed along with it being so warm as the blizzard was still going on outside. \"You like it don't you?\" Dusty said to him in his ear to which Kodi said, \"You know maybe this aint so bad.\" \"See? I know you would come around.\" Dusty said before a belch came from her. \"Oh, sorry about that, all this eating has sort of made me sleepy.\" \"Yeah I think so to-HIC!\" Kodi said as feeling the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you Kodi.\" Dusty said as she laid her head down on Kodi's belly, \"Love you too.\" Kodi said as he laid his on top of her head as they both fall into deep sleep in sitting positions with their big bellies side by side with their navels visible making gurgling and groaning noises together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get an idea how Big Kodi and Dusty bellies are here's this link of Balto and Steele. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/31432577/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/31432577...</a> </span></div></div>",

GO!\"</span> Balto shouted as they both dug in the pile of meat devouring every single piece of meat there was, lucky for Steele as he had the upper hand as his belly was just starting to get big and for Balto his belly was starting to become a bit chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"Heh, look at you, looks like you only just ate a full day's meal and your not big enough compared to me!\"</span> Steele taunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe challenge was on and Balto wasn't going to let Steele win so easy but he felt his belly was so full so he mustard his inner wolf in him to wolfing down the meat instead of chewing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16 minutes later their bellies started to touch the ground, and Balto has overcame his discomfort in his in his belly as it now started to feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"You know Balto, this is pretty fun idea to see who can have the biggest belly.\"</span> Said Steele as Balto replied back <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Yeah I know, so I guess we're friends now?\"</span> <span class=\"cblack\">\"Maybe if we reach to a tie?\"</span> So they continued on with each juicy meat they consume and digested into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour in their bellies were bigger than a dog standing on two feet, their once muscular legs were now replaced with flab along with their big behinds and chests formed two big pillow like moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto was in a sitting position with his paws pressuring into his fat belly as it felt good to be this big as he held in his maw the last piece of steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"Hey Wolfy! Give me that slice of meat, I'm still hungry.\"</span> Steele said as he waddled behind Balto but couldn't move with the big lard of a white belly limited him from getting closer to the equally lard wolfdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">\"What's wrong big guy, are you already beached, you glutton?\"</span> Balto said with a smile as he chuckled with the meat still in his maw. Steele jumped up with his hind legs but with his belly still on the ground as Steele than rolled down in the front direction where Steele's head landed behind Balto's rump with a thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto than sucked up the last meat in defiance. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Looks like I win Steele.\"</span> Balto said as he turned his head towards Steele.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky left up from the Wolfdog's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"Really? It looks like a tie to me as we are both equally fatasses.\"</span> Steele exclaimed proving a point. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Okay Steele, it's a tie.\"</span> He said as Balto moved a bit to where Steele was sitting. Both of their fat bellies making sloshing and gurgling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblack\">\"You look pretty good with a fat look on ya wolfdog.\"</span> <span class=\"cbrown\">\"I could say the same for you too Steele.\"</span> They both complemented their bellies as both of them started getting attractive to eachother with their girth. Balto and Steele were just gazing at eachother's bellies with their noises going on until they heard some paw steps coming to the entrance and it was... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it depends on how her health is by that point,\" the doctor said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight weeks?

I'm so sorry, honey,\" Riley's mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here, they finished up the finals things they needed to clear with the doctor, and then Riley began to walk out of the office with her mother.

She had grown so much in those eleven years. Learned so much, done so much, and of course she grew a lot. She already went on her first date. Yeah she and the others did a good job. Even sadness. Riley also made some new friends. She started to feel at home in this new city. Everything was going well and Riley was the happy girl again she normally was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly hockey land suddenly went some sort of dark. It was just like somebody pulled the plug out of it. It was't like that time it fell apart. It was more like... it just did't worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Joy asked. \"Sadness did you do anything to Riley's core memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Sadness said. \"I'm busy. Riley is sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why is Riley sad?\" Joy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you remembered that Riley injured her feet. Well it's hurt pretty bad. She can't play hockey for some time. So she's pretty sad she won't be able to play for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked outside. It made sense. She could't play hockey for some time. That's why hockey land was suddenly dark. Not being able to play mend that she also could't really do it. Well perhaps it would start working again after she was healed. nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley needs a new hobby.\" Sadness said. \"Something she likes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh sadness, nothing personal... but... if she needs to like something... I think it's better if I do it.\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... that's maybe better.\" Sadness said and stepped aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley sadly stepped in the car an looked outside. What did she needed to do for eight weeks, at least. She knew she could't play hockey. She was wise enough too understand that. But what now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley, I have a idea what will make you feel better.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Riley asked on a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I learn you how teach you how to bake. Cookies, brownies pie. Who knows you might like it. Besides you love baked goodies. Can't hurt if you teach how to make them. At least then you have something to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley thought about this. She did loved baked goodies. But could that really replace hockey. Well perhaps it would be fun. She had nothing to lose. If she did't like it she could always stop. But it sounded like fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy did what she did best and Riley started to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that mom.\" </span></div></div>",

The Emotions liked that about Riley, she was figuratively a quick learner. Jill, Riley's mother, had taken off the training wheels after a few sessions and let Riley glide on her own. She started off small with simple chocolate chip cookies that started to taste better after every batch of cakes that tasted of delicious watermelon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was...well...overjoyed that Riley had found another thing that she was good at. Baking! With everything she made, the approval of her parents, as well as her own self-approval, filled her with glee. Creating many wonderous memories with some linked to the desirable flavor of the treats she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill, Riley's father, perked up after a taste of key lime cheesecake, \"Oh, Riley. This is fantastic! You've really got a gift here.\" Riley blushed, \"Oh, it's nothing. Mom, really helped me with bringing out the flavor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I only told you what I knew,\" Jill, Riley's mother, started her second slice of cheesecake, \"Besides, you worked hard enough to become this good at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at the smiles on her parent's faces! Look at the smile on Riley's face!\", Joy pinched Anger's cheeks. \"I can clearly see that, Joy.\" He swiped her hands away, \"It's been a good vacation so far. Whenever Riley's mad, she eats a few brownies and calms down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadness reclines in his beach chair, \"Yep. Whenever she feels sad, a slice of cake or two makes my job a whole lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whenever she joyful, brownies and pies keep her spirits up no problem,\" said Joy, \"How about you, Disgust? You enjoying how things are running now?\" Disgust took off her sunglasses and rolled her eyes, \"For the time being.\" The green emotion lays back in the jacuzzi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was confused, \"What do you mean? I don't think something could change the way things are going. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgust gave the blue haired emotion a look, \"Gee. I guess so. I mean. It's not Riley scarfing down an extra thousand calories a day isn't going to change anything.\" Joy tutted, \"It certainly won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the baking commenced, with Riley creating a new delicious morsel, every two days, for her and the family to enjoy. Sometimes it would vanish within two days, other times, hours. Everybody was happy, Riley's leg was healing just fine, and the household was more joyous than ever. And Joy was right, nothing changed the way things were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until, Riley woke up one morning, about one and a half months after she started baking, to see...</span></div></div>",

Baking really started to become one of her biggest hobbies. But not only baking, also eating was becoming a great hobby of her. Riey's parents both put on a few pounds but Riley put on more then a few. When baking cookies or brownies a lot ended in her belly before she gave them to her parents. But Riley did't noticed this until this day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of bed and got out of her pajamas. She took one look at herself in the mirror and froze. The girl she saw in the mirror was that really her? Sure she still had the same hair and the same face. Almost since she could clearly see that her cheeks bot a bit rounder and she was starting to get a second chin. Also her but and thighs got bigger. She also noticed with some joy that her boobs also were a lot bigger but her belly obvious gained most of the weight.Her belly was getting round was sticking out a bit forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley could't believe it.

About eating a extra thousand calories. It affected her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Disgust asked. \"Should she be scared about how much she gained. Maybe angry.

She made enough food so her parents still got some treats. But more and more of the food went in Riley's stomach that became a bit bigger each day. However Joy still made Riley feel happy about it. Even while Riley noticed some of her clothes became kind of tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked outside. At all islands that made Riley Riley. Hockey island was still dark. Just like someone pulled the plug out and no one cared to put it back in. There was also a new island. Baking island. Baking really became a big hobby from Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your still thinking that letting Riley stuff her face is good for her?\" Disgust asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. After Riley's feet is healed she will continue hockey. I guess. So then she plays sports again. Don't be so worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't think it's good to let Riley consume about a thousand calories extra each day, making her fat and liking it.\" Disgust said. \"She never liked fat before. Remember in first grade. When she said to that dark haired girl: Fatty fat two by four can't fit through the cafeteria door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that girl Fatty Fiona. Well that was a long time ago. Riley is more mature now. She's eleven. She's almost twelve and then she goes to high school.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she still fit's through the school doors you mean.\" Disgust said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A come on. You're all acting like Riley is the only kid with some extra pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what would her boyfriend think about her?\" Sadness asked. \"Not that imaginary one but that real one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps he likes it!\" Joy said. \"You worry too much. Riley is happy. That's most important!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley got some brownies and a cake out of the oven and sniffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious. The best time to eat them are when they're warm. Like now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words Riley started to stuff her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Riley began to pig out on the brownies, she began to put her hands on her stomach. She felt like she was feeling more full from eating this amount of food, but she liked the taste of it overall. As she was sitting down, Riley did notice that she looked sort of pregnant with the way her stomach was shaped. She felt like she wanted to get some tighter clothes to see how much bigger she truly has gotten. But before she did, Riley heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley, your Mom and I are going to run to the store for a few hours. Is there anything you need?\" Her Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Anything with baking would help. I found a few recipes I could use for the future. I wanted to try and make some fudge as well at some point,\" Riley said with a chocolate coated grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! We will see you in a bit,\" Riley's Dad said as he left. A few moments later, Riley smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all alone. Time to eat some more foods,\" Riley said as she started getting out ingredients for a German chocolate cake, one of her Mom's delicacies. Riley began cooking up the ingredients fast until she got to the point of putting the cake in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I have thirty minutes or so. I should go see how this looks with tighter clothing,\" Riley said as she ran upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she began looking around for some clothing to wear. First, she found herself a tank top that was used for her hockey team. She immediately put it on and saw how it did not fit the same. Her boobs were more apparent because of her fat build up, and her midsection could not cover up her belly because of the added fat. Then, she found a pair of work out shorts with her hockey team's logo on it. These shorts looked like elastic material as they were quite fitted for any body. Riley put this on and saw that they felt tighter as well. The top area of her thighs were starting to rub against one another, which also gave her hips a bigger look. In all honesty, Riley's butt definitely got bigger. Finally, Riley looked and saw that she had a green beanie nearby with a green and white puff ball, and had her hockey team's logo on it. She used to wear this a lot when she went to team practices. She then looked in the mirror and was content with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I'll ever be able to play hockey again. But with this body, it might not be a bad thing if I keep up this new hobby,\" Riley said as she felt her fat more and started to smile at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Riley ran downstairs to wait for her cake to be ready as the chubby child longed for more chocolate. </span></div></div>",

Riley was't the thin girl she was some time ago. But Riley was very happy. Thanks to joy. She got pretty fat the past month. Her thighs were now rubbing if she waddled. Her butt was more wobbly and she really needed to start wearing a bra what made not only Riley very happy but also her mom. Her cheeks were starting to get pink and puffy. But Riley's belly was very big now. It formed two nice big juicy rolls that were very soft like a pillow. Riley must admit that she liked her new hobby, and her new weight. She liked the baking and the eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning Riley was busy making an delicious apple pie when her mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Riley. How's my beautiful baking daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm fine mom.\" Said Riley while she cut an apple in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley I was wondering... did you think about hockey lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley froze for a second. To be honest she did't thought about it. Two weeks ago her foot was healed. She loved baking but that did't mend she did't liked hockey any more. Riley did't want to give up hockey, baking or eating. But Riley was creative. If you did't want to lose one thing you need to combine it. She could go to Hockey training whenever there was training and the other days she could bake, and eat. She admitted that she did miss her friends from hockey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I did't. My leg needed time to heal. But now you're saying this, I would like it to play hockey again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I think it would also be good if you would exercise a bit. You gained some weight lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked out the window. Then suddenly everything started working on hockey island. Lights went on and it got back it's color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's back on! Hockey island is back on!\" She yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. It's about time.\" Anger said. \"I cant wait for a match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a match as hockey you sometimes needed a bit of anger to beat the others. Hockey could sometimes be pretty rough. But Riley wast a weak girl that was gonna cry if she fell. No tears and just jump back on you skates, and continue the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that might take a while. She did't trained for two and a half month. It might take some time before she skates again like before.\" Sadness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Riley will skate just fine after an hour on the ice. It will be like before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it won't. Riley is now carrying a lot of extra weight with her.\" Disgust said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley gained a lot of weight.\" Sadness said. \"Girls can be really mean. Boys whisper but girls talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so negative.\" Joy said. \"I'm sure everything is gonna be all right.\" </span></div></div>",

She knew that it had been a little bit since she played last, but she was not going to give up on her favorite sport so easily. When Riley entered her room, she began to take off her pajamas to get into her proper attire. However, one of the first things Riley noticed is that it took a little bit for her to take off her clothes. Finally, at one point, she was standing in front of her mirror completely naked observing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe my Mom is right. I have gotten bigger, but why is it a bad thing?\" Riley wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw as her thighs touched each other mostly down her legs, which now gave her a more veluptuous figure overall. She clearly had a muffin top on both sides of her body that showed how much excess fat that she had. Her boobs were really starting to get bigger as they kept on building up with fat from not working out. Her stomach was the biggest part of her body as it stuck out so much, she could either pass for being pregnant or for being round in general. Finally, Riley looked into the mirror and saw her face. Her cheeks definitely made her look more stuffed overall, but her chin was definitely a double chin at this point. The skinny girl Riley once was was now buried in fat and calories that were stored for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we will see how it goes today. Hopefully I can play just as well as I used to,\" Riley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she grabbed a pair of leggings and slipped them on. It look a lot of time since her thighs were much bigger. Every outline of fat on her legs could be seen through the leggings. Then, Riley slipped on her green jersey that was a lot tighter than usual. Her arms had difficultly getting through the jersey as well as her belly was sticking out of the bottom of her shirt. Finally, Riley grabbed her green puff ball hat with her team's logo on it and slipped it over her head. It gave Riley more of a tomboy look, but she smiled as she knew no one could knock her down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Maybe being this fat could be a good thing,\" Riley grinned as she shoved a cookie in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

I'm all better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley!

I started baking. I think I became pretty good. But I guess I ate a bit much of my backings. So I gained a bit. No biggie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you gained more then a bit.\" A other girl said snappish but Riley never liked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls got on the ice and skated towards their trainer. A friendly young woman with dark blond hair in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Riley your back. With some extra... All right. I split you up in two teams. Let's see how you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley must admit it was bit strange standing back on her skates but after a few minutes it felt like the old days and she played again with her friends. Suddenly she got the puck. She went towards the goal. But a big girl tried to stop her. Her way was to skate right at you, pushing you over. It would have worked on the old Riley. She pushed Riley but with all the extra weight she was too heavy to be pushed over.

Eating ice cream. While talking about hockey what happened the past days. Riley felt good hanging out with her friends. Making a new start here was hard but after some time she made some good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Riley I don't know what you did the past months but it sure was good for your hockey skills.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you. I could't play hockey, for some time, so I looked for a new hobby. My mother suggested baking. Well I tried it and... well I liked it. I also became pretty good at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also became pretty fat from it!\" A thin girl with black hair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh put a sock in it Roxanne!\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she did!\" Roxanne said. \"I also noticed she became a lot slower. She could't keep up with you while she before was faster then you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course. She did't trained for over two months. After a few trainings she will skate like before.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well being fatter was a good thing. No one was able to push you over. But you were able to push others over.\" A small freckled girl with dark red hair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again.\" A girl with purple colored hair said. Riley remembered she pushed her away. \"She pushed me out of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Riley said. \"I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologize. That's hockey. That happens when you play hockey. Come on. We're not wimps. If you get pushed over you need to get right up back on your skates. We're a girls hockey team and we rule! Girls rule!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that was a good pep talk.\" Kelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked happy.

I told you that everything worked out fine.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Disgust asked. \"Roxanne seems to have a different ideas about it.

I will be right back,\" Samantha said as she went to get more for Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley was kind of taken aback with how her team wanted her to get bigger. She had heard so much about how getting fat could have bad health effects on the body. She even heard how some people got so big, they would not be able to move or could even die. However, for some reason, she didn't really seem to care as the idea sounded kind of enlightening to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess being fat was a good thing after all,\" Riley said to herself as she examined her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment later, Samantha came back with three more bowls of ice cream. She grabbed Riley's hat and pulled it down over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the feeding to us. You just sit there and enjoy the feeding,\" Kelly said as all the girls but Roxanne began to help Riley pig out.

She was still baking. It was still her hobby. She went too her hockey training but when there was't hockey training she was or baking, or hanging out with her friends or of course eating. Riley realized she liked eating. But if you ate too much you could become fat. But now people wanted her too become fat. Riley was't sure about it but she loved to eat and her friends helped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later she was busy in the kitchen baking a cake when her mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Riley. Hm what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cake. It's nice and fluffy. Just the way you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled. She had a big weakness for Riley baked products and especially the cake and pies. She smiled at her daughter and saw how Riley's belly pushed against the fabric of her once baggy sweater but that was now stretched to it's limit. She could also see between her sweater and pants a stroke of white flesh from Riley's belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized her daughter became bigger but she was't really sure if she had something to worry about. After all Riley was a growing girl. She would soon hit puberty. She also heard you should never put kids on a crash diet, but at the other hand she did't want Riley to became in a talk show about teens who weighed over 200 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong mom?\" Riley asked and smiled with puffy, bowl pink cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh yeah sweetie. Your father and I decided you should see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? A doctor. I'm not sick mom. I feel fine really. My feet is fine. I play hockey like before. Nothing is wrong. Why do I need to see the doctor. Or do you think something is wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, of course not sweetie. It's just a check up. Don't forget you stopped playing hockey for more then a month, now you started again. Soon you become a teenager. I just want to be sure you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley sighed. She knew she would need to see the doctor sooner or later. But suddenly she realized something else. Her weight. She never cared before. She always used to have a normal weight. If she would't have broken her feet she would still have. But if she was too heavy she should probably have to diet. But she did't wanted to stop eating her baked products. Her team mates also wanted her too become fatter. But she doubted the scale would say she had a healthy weight. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wore her puff ball hat as well as she had to go to hockey practice right after the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Riley's head, things were running wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this was a bad idea!

Before we begin, I just need you to get on the scale,\" the doctor said pointing to the scale right in the room. Slowly but surely, Riley began to walk over, feeling like she was hearing a death march in her head not knowing what would come next.</span></div></div>",

She closed her eyes and stepped on it. The doctor looked at the number and looked at Riley and wrote the weight down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor did a few more tests. Nothing strange. She did have check ups before. She normally used to be pretty healthy. All the hockey training made her a sportive girl with some muscle. She always was healthy. The doctor also checked her foot to be sure. The he walked to his desk. Riley and Jill looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Riley seems to be perfectly healthy.\" He started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley sighed relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However I noticed her weight is really high. Especially compared to last time. I rarely saw anyone gain so much weight so fast. Especially someone your age. Do you eat all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... eh... I guess I gained so much weight because I did't exercised. For some time. You remember I injured my feet. So around that time I could't play hockey. I'm also a growing girl.\" Riley said , thinking it sounded logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true. That may have caused some weight gain.\" The doctor said. \"But you gained way more then you should. However... you foot healed. Do you play hockey again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you seem perfectly healthy further... that's a good thing. It's true you're also growing so you have a chance to grow into it. Especially if you get a growth spurt that could happen every moment. But I advice you to stay away from cookies, chips, soda and other unhealthy stuff. Don't eat to much junk food and eat more fruit and vegetables. Then I think your weight should go back to normal. Else you might get serious problems when your older. Hart diseases, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm on a diet?\" Riley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You're to young to put you on a crash diet. Especially since like you said, you're still a growing girl. You just need to cut back a bit on some stuff. Also try to cook the food by yourself. That's healthier then canned or jarred food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley smiled. Make food by yourself. That was just one of her biggest hobbies. Make food by herself. </span></div></div>",

Riley was snacking on a chocolate bar as she smiled with relief. She was happy that the doctor did not make her go against her eating completely. Riley knew with the right amount of talk, she could convince her parents that her eating habits are fine. Riley pulled her hat down over her head more as she looked at her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom, when I get home later, can I make some chocolate cake?\" Riley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you sure you want to make more of that?\" Riley's Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean yeah. I just learned the perfect recipe and want to test it out,\" Riley said with puppy eyes to her Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... I don't want to stop you from learning. That should be fine,\" Riley's Mom said as they pulled up to the hockey arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mom! I'll see you at home later,\" Riley said as she exited the vehicle with her hockey stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Riley walked into the arena locker room as she was going to get ready for practice. She noticed that she was early to practice with around an hour to kill before her friends started to arrive. She went over to her locker to open it up and change into her uniform. However, right when she looked in there, she saw what she couldn't believe: desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like someone had stacked plates of desserts to fill most of her locker. On the door of the locker was a note that read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Riley,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe know you are excited to continue bulking up for hockey. Some of us went out and got some food so we can help you continue. We hope to see it gone before we arrive at practice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley knew her friends were really excited about this process, which gave Riley a feeling in her stomach. Who knew becoming fat could have these benefits? </span></div></div>",

They were delicious. sweet an most important... fattening. After all Riley did't do it for herself. She did it all for the team. Right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to think about this. Sure, her friends supported her weight gain because she was harder to push over or aside and was harder to stop her. That was a good thing for the team. But was that the only reason? No! She knew that answer. She liked it to eat. She liked eating just so much or perhaps even more then she liked baking. She also enjoyed the weight gain. The curves that came. The growth of her boobs. the bigger thighs what all gave her a bit more female shape. She must admit she liked her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and wolfed down another treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley ate and ate. She was almost done when she suddenly felt something. She looked down and saw her growing belly was peaking out between her pants and shirt. She blushed a bit and pulled her shirt down. At least she tried to pull it down but noticed it did't went down any further. Riley realized that her weight gain started to catch up with her clothing sizes. She must admit that her clothes did felt awfully tight the last days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her pants and saw they were also cutting in her soft belly flesh. She looked at the clock. It might still be some time before the first girls would come. She stripped down until she wore nothing except her underwear and wolfed down the last things. As long if nobody saw her here eating in nothing but her underwear there was no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last treats went down to her belly. Riley rubbed her belly for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think anything is wrong.\" Joy said and pointed to the wall. \"Look.

Passing by the bathroom, Riley heard what sounded like stretching fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, c'mon!\" Riley peered in, and saw her mom, Jill, struggling to button her pants. Upon a closer look, it was clear why. <br>\r\nThe last month 1/2 of Riley's new hobby seemed to have taken a toll on Jill's weight. Her chest was slightly broader than before, along with her arms and her thighs, and Riley spotted the tiniest hint of a 2nd chin. Her mom's hips and rear, already rather large, had grown to the point of stretching the seat of her pants. But Jill's stomach was probably the most hit, curving out noticeably from her waist and too large for Jill to button her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I know these fit! Urrrg!\" Jill groaned, not noticing Riley in the doorway. Not knowing what to make of the sight, Riley hastily entered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(inside Riley's head)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was weird.\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding.\" Said Disgust. \"Looks like Mom's put on a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" Asked fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy thought about it. \"For the time being, let's just keep quiet about it. Mom probably knows about it already, so let's not upset her by bringing it up.\" The other Emotions agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley resolved not to bring up her mom's sudden weight issue. That moment, however, Jill came into the kitchen, her pants looking a little tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, honey.\" She said. \"Mm, I'm starving! Mind making some of that amazing french toast of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley blinked. Apparently, Jill hadn't noticed, since her appetite didn't seem to have changed.

Riley loved baking, so much so that she\u2019d barely paid attention to how her injured foot was doing. Her parents were enjoying her new habit too, especially her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley flipped the last piece of french toast onto the stack and shut off the stove. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d made; plates stacked high with french toast and slathered in maple syrup sat in front of Riley\u2019s mom, covering a significant part of the small kitchen table. Jill looked at the feast with a ravenous look in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Riley! You really went all out!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I got a little carried away.\u201d Riley shrugged as she got herself a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d Asked Jill. \u201cI doubt I can finish all this myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks mom.\u201d Riley said as she sat down, sipping her juice. \u201cI made it for you. Enjoy it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, sweetie.\u201d Her mom smiled. \u201cAlthough we\u2019re probably gonna have leftovers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that assumption quickly seemed unlikely when Jill began to eat. Riley watched her mom cut apart the slices of syrup-covered toast and stuff them into her mouth, sometimes pausing as she chewed to add more bites, moaning at the delicious cinnamon flavor. Riley watched as the stacks of french toast gradually shrank until the plates were bare, and Jill was slurping the syrup off her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, ahhh! That hit the spot!\u201d Jill said, seemingly unaware that she ate the whole feast without even pausing. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I had a breakfast that good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, mom!\u201d Riley said, surprised that her mother had eaten the entire feast without batting an eye. She glanced at the wall clock; it hadn\u2019t even been that long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew!\u201d Jill huffed. \u201cThat french toast was great Riley, but I\u2019m stuffed.

Lazle and Loveharlet just stared, slack-jawed, as the 15.2273 meter (49 foot, 11 \u00bd inch) woman instantly shrunk down to her original size. After it was done, Chubbo lifted up the sleeping no longer-giant over her shoulder and began waddling to the portal, but was stopped by her still shocked partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Chubbo. How did you do that?\u201d Lazle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy shrink ray decreases the size and mass of any object that it fires at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Queen Fatalina outlawed anything that lowers weight.\u201d Loveharlet informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but she let me keep it because it also makes its targets\u2019 appetites increase inversely to their size change. In other words, she does possess the height and weight of a normal human female, but her metabolism has increased so she must consume the same amount of food as she had to when she was a giant.\u201d Chubbo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. Now let\u2019s bring her to the Queen.\u201d Lazle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three obese aliens entered the portal and ended up in the throne room of Queen Fatalina. They bowed to their master and Chubbo place Susan on the floor in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping to see a giant embrace our slovenly lifestyle, but this is good nonetheless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we do with her, your highness?\u201d Lazle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have Chubbo whip up a massive feast for her, as a friendly gesture.\u201d Fatalina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d Chubbo said before waddling to the royal kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLazle and Loveharlet, you two are in charge of putting the human in restraints until the food is prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoveharlet and Lazle took Susan and locked her in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be interesting.\u201d Queen Fatalina thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan came to, slowly, and when she woke up, she was confused by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, why am I in a chair?\u201d Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, my dear, but I didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d A distant voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho said that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer answer came in the form of an obese extraterrestrial in a floating throne. She was 907.18474 kilograms (2000 pounds) and 3.6576 meters (12 feet) tall. She had six rolls of fat for a stomach; each one was 0.3048 meters (one foot) thick. She also had two breasts that were so flabby that Susan first mistook them for more fat folds. Her buttocks was large enough to fill up the space of a king-sized mattress and her legs, weak and shriveled up from a lack of use, were almost completely sunk into her massive frame. Her skin was as pale as a bed sheet due to a lack of exposure to sunlight, but her hair was short and black. She had tired, grey eyes, as if just trying to look at the person in front of her was a task in and of itself. All over her body lied innumerable stains of food. The large creature was clad in nothing but a crown atop her head, hinting to Susan that she might be the one who was running this joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Miss Susan Murphy, my colleagues and I have heard of you and your group of strange Earth creatures vanquishing the space criminal, Galaxar, and we have taken an interest in your planet. More specifically, we are interested in you because of your previously giant appearance. So we\u2019ve taken you to our ship to extend our hospitality.\u201d Queen Fatalina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly, I\u2019m flattered to have fans, but kidnapping me isn\u2019t a way to show me gratitude. Second, what do you mean \u2018previously giant\u2019? And third, how can you talk to me when your mouth isn\u2019t moving?\u201d Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, you\u2019re quite inquisitive. To answer your first question, my chef, Chubbo, shrunk you down in order to bring you aboard, although the same amount of Quantonium is still inside of you, which is why you still have white hair.\u201d Fatalina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was shown a mirror and she saw that the Queen was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for the second, our race, the Blubbarians, have long since evolved beyond the need to communicate by \u2018talking\u2019. Instead, we can speak telepathically. We don\u2019t even need our mouths to breath. It is done through our noses. We only need them for one thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich would be?\u201d Susan asked in negative anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating food.\u201d Fatalina finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement horrified Susan, especially since she couldn\u2019t really defend herself without her giant form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no! You\u2019re going to eat me, aren\u2019t you?!\u201d Susan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. We have more than enough food to sustain us and we\u2019d like you to join.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was rather awkward for Susan. On one hand, she didn\u2019t want to be rude, but on the other hand, they kidnapped her and she wasn\u2019t exactly in the mood for whatever alien filth they might cook up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m going to have to pass on that. The rest of Team Monster is probably worried sick about me.\u201d Susan denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please stay for a quick bite? I promise you that you will enjoy it.\u201d Fatalina persuaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was Susan overly-polite nature, or maybe it was just a desire to end this conversation and get off of this vessel sooner, but in any case, she gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Queen Fatalina, I\u2019ll stay for a bit.\u201d Susan agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. The food should be done now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she said that, Chubbo called them into the kitchen for an early breakfast. Fatalina allowed Susan to exit her restraints and wanted the reluctant hero to follow her to the awaiting feast <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alien and Earthling went into the royal kitchen. It was a solid white room with a four legged, 1.524 meter (5 feet) tall, silver table that had a red cover. There were two chairs in the room. One was 2.1336 meters (7 feet) tall and the other, which Susan assumed was the Queen\u2019s, was twice as tall as hers. However, she didn\u2019t care about that. No, what got the attention of the abducted human were the contents atop the table\u2026</span></div></div>",

Blue sludge oozed over the table and onto the floor, where it began melting through it. However, the look wasn\u2019t the worst part of it. No, that might have been the smell. She could practically feel the fragrance (if you could even call it that) wrap itself around her like a warm, sticky coat. Even though she covered her nose, it somehow made its way inside. Once it hit her nasal cavity, Susan almost fainted. Queen Fatalina noticed her momentary lapse in composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Susan? This is the best food that our race could make. Normally, I am the only one whom is privy to consuming such high-class meals.\u201d Fatalina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement caused the former giantess to contort her face into an expression of shocked. Was this woman joking? This was what passed for fine-dining to these people? The mere thought of someone eating this slop, let alone enjoy doing so, made her want to throw up even more. However, as much as she wanted to spout off in a profanity-laden refusal to eat this food, she did promise to have breakfast with the Queen, and she wasn\u2019t the kind of person whom breaks her promises, regardless of how much she would come to regret them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Queen Fatalina. I just didn\u2019t expect your food to be-\u201d Susan began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-so wonderfully delicious looking.\u201d The Queen interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure, why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, enough talk. Let\u2019s eat.\u201dFatalina exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Susan said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe two took their seats at opposite ends of the table, Fatalina smiling at Susan, whom returned it weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe sure to save some food for me, Susan dear.\u201d Fatalina requested playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to worry about me eating too much, trust me.\u201d Susan replied meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the feasting began, for Fatalina, at least. Susan was still very reluctant to dig in to her breakfast. While waiting, she saw the Queen make a complete pig of herself. Sticking her hands into the pile, she shoveled massive quantities of the sludge into her mouth, slowly shrinking the azure mountain of food. Her belly grew a centimeter in diameter with every gulp. Then, she paused momentarily and straightened herself up in her throne-like chair. Susan questioned her sudden cease in gluttony, but that was answered a second later by the Queen\u2019s next action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*<u><i><b>BBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHH!</b></i>{ /u}*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Fatalina\u2019s unhinged her jaw in order to fully release her gigantic burp. For 10 seconds, moist globs of saliva were launched from her mouth and onto the breakfast on the table. Some of it even landed on Susan. The heroine coughed and became teary-eyed as putrid vapors spewed out as well, filling the kitchen with an odor that made that of the food smell like roses. What took the cake though, was the volume. Covering her ears did nothing to prevent Susan from nearly becoming deaf. The belch echoed throughout the room and even shook it a bit. After the ungodly eructation had died down, Fatalina sighed in relief and looked at Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve eaten anything yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>What was with this woman?! First, she kidnapped me. Next she ate with so little table manners that she made B.O.B. look civilized. Now, she expects me to eat this shit as if she hadn\u2019t just let out a burp strong enough to deafen someone!</i>\u201d Susan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Oueen, but I just can\u2019t eat this food, especially after you just nonchalantly belched at me.\u201d Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it is traditional to burp when eating, as it shows gratitude toward the people whom prepared one\u2019s food. According to our intelligence, some of the countries on Earth also practice such customs.\u201d Fatalina explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my country isn\u2019t one of them. I want to go back to Earth, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fatalina\u2019s eyes lessened in size, given her an angered demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suggest that you reconsider your actions, Susan dear.\u201d The Queen said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m getting off of this thing right now.\u201d Susan declared forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen sent out a mental signal that summoned Loveharlet and Lazle to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat troubles you, Your Highness?\u201d Lazle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur guest is behaving rudely after I offered her some of our best food. I require you two to use your \u2018special talents\u2019 to keep her here.\u201d Queen Fatalina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d Loveharlet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned toward Susan and Lazle pounced at her, tackling her to the floor. Her far greater mass made it impossible for Susan to get up. Lazle then kissed her on the lips, sapping the Earthling of much of her strength. Loveharlet pulled up Lazle and Susan and placed Susan back in her table seat, which was now restraining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to pay for your impolite actions, Susan Murphy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoveharlet began scooping up some of the slop and force fed the barely conscious heroine. Susan squirmed in disgust as she had to endure the awful taste, but being unable to fight, she had no other option but to just bare the torment and as it continued, her stomach was showing how much that torment affected her.</u></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time \u2013 6:00 A.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Susan\u2019s utter surprise, the spread laid out before her consisted of some of the best looking food that the white-haired woman had ever seen. The table was divided into nine sectors. At the center were stacks of golden brown French toast, chocolate pancakes, and Belgium waffles layered with melting butter, viscous maple syrup, colorful fruit, globs of jellies, and snow-like powdered sugar reached to the top of the room. In the center-front closest to Susan were dozens of bowls filled with mushy oatmeal, some fresh milk, and every kind of cereal in the world, from Coco Puffs to Franken-berry. Baked goods like fluffy biscuits topped with jellies and marmalades, gooey donuts coated in frosting and sprinkles, glazed cinnamon rolls, honey buns, and crunchy croissants took up the center-left area of the table. Greasy meats like crispy bacon, sausages in the form of patties and links, and cured ham filled up the center-right. The center-back contained so many pop-tarts that out of context, one would think that someone got a lifetime supply of every kind. The aforementioned stack was cornered by simple hash browns in the upper-left and assorted breakfast burritos in the upper-right. The lower-left was composed of yogurt cups and orange juice pitchers. Eggs \u2013 scrambled, yolks, hard-boiled, poached, sunny-side up, omelettes \u2013 decorated the lower-right corner. The mere sight of it all caused Susan to salivate slightly, which did not go unnoticed by the alien royal figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell that you are enjoying what you see, are you not?\u201d Fatalina inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but how did you manage to make this kind of food?\u201d Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did not know if you would like our native delicacies, so Chubbo gathered intelligence and materials in order to create a proper Earth breakfast.\u201d Fatalina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. I for one am rather anxious to try your foreign cuisine.\u201d Fatalina replied as she took a seat at the opposite side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan sat in her own chair and put a spoonful of Fruit Loops in her mouth. Her eyes widened in shock. This was one of, if not, THE best tasting Fruit Loops that she had ever eaten! Without haste, she wolfed down the entire bowl, milk and all. Then, she repeated the process with every other cereal bowl on the table, as well as the oatmeal. In order to eat faster, she started bringing the bowls to her lips and gulping down the contents within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One hour later\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had eaten one of every kind of cereal and oatmeal on Earth and she definitely had the stomach to show for it. Her packed paunch extended to 0.3048 meters (1 foot) in width, height, and length. The snow-haired lady reclined in her chair and sighed contently. She started rubbing her enormous belly, until she realized\u2026 that she had an enormous belly. Susan\u2019s shock only increased when she saw just how food she had actually consumed. Encompassing her field of vision were no longer decadent bowls of oatmeal and cereal, but vacant bowls that were dryer than bones. Before Susan could comprehend what she had just done, another feeling took her by surprise: that of a very bloated belly that in an hour had just ingested enough oatmeal and cereal to feed a family for a year and wasn\u2019t quite used to doing so. As a result, Susan had to deal with some very painful indigestion. She moaned and groaned in agony as her tummy commenced with the arduous task of digestion. Eventually, her distressed cries were answered by Fatalina herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, Susan?\u201d The Queen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a stomachache. I\u2019ve never eaten so much food before.\u201d Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s because the ray that shrunk you also increased your appetite and the Quantonium inside of you has increased it even more. However, your body hasn\u2019t gotten used to consuming all of that food yet, so you should watch how quickly you eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but how does that help me with my problem?\u201d Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a solution.\u201d Fatalina stated before summoning Loveharlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoveharlet, Susan has ingested too much food too quickly, so I want you to ease the pain in her abdomen.\u201d Fatalina ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoveharlet waddled over to the swollen superhero and began massaging her globular gut. Her ten alien digits felt magnificent to Susan\u2019s stomach, even though she was still wearing her black and orange jumpsuit, therefore lessening her sense of touch. Susan continued to moan, but now in pleasure rather than misery. This lasted for 10 minutes until Susan\u2019s belly gurgled loudly. All of that rubbing appeared to have shifted around some very large bubbles of gas and with no other place to go, they forced their way up Susan\u2019s esophagus, puffing out cheeks when they entered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Susan?\u201d Loveharlet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c~*<u><i><b>BBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</b></i></u>*~ ~*<u><i><b>BBBBBBBBEEEEEEELLLLLCCCCCCHHHH!</b></i></u>*~ ~*<u><i><b>BBBBBBUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!</b></i></u>*~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan\u2019s lips quivered at the ferocious winds pushing their way out of her mouth. Being at the epicenter of the gassy explosion, Loveharlet\u2019s face was bathed in the milky-haired woman\u2019s noxious burp as its sheer force blew her chocolate-colored, shoulder length locks into the air. After its 7 second duration, a second belch rocketed out of Susan\u2019s mouth, almost like an aftershock to the first earthquake of a burp. This burp, though less powerful than the first, was still a danger to be in the presence of. Loveharlet\u2019s hair once again flustered in the smelly wind, through visibly less so. The volume of the eructation alone was enough to pierce her eardrums. The burp ceased after six seconds, earning a momentary look of uncertainty from Fatalina\u2019s henchwoman. Unfortunately, a third onslaught of fumes immediately erupted from the depths of Susan\u2019s otherwise relaxed tummy. Loveharlet\u2019s hair was barely moved a centimeter, but it was her nose that took the brunt of it. The belch pounded into her nose with the smell of partially digested oatmeal and cereal filling her nasal cavity. Eventually, Susan\u2019s 5-second gas blast ended, to her relief. However, seeing what she had done to her, the abducted girl felt a far stronger sense of embarrassment. Blushing a dark rose and sapping her hand to her mouth, Susan could only imagine how poorly her hosts would react to her breach in etiquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Susan said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response she got would be shocking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize for your behavior Susan.\u201d Loveharlet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, belching is a compliment in our culture as well as some of the cultures of Earth.\u201d Loveharlet said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right. You can belch as much as you want when you eat here.\u201d Queen Fatalina stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new information brought to light, Susan decided to consume\u2026</span></div></div>",

I've been partying so long with Itchy, &amp; taking a big dive in a pool. How come you're tired?\" \"I'm just hanging out with him, that's all. Glad you have fun.\" \"Well, good night Sasha.\" \"Goodnight Charlie. And don't forget, tomorrow is our trip to Hawaii! You excited?\" \"Yeah, sure. That'll be great.\" And he went upstairs to David's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was so full &amp; tired, but thin. He really wished he could stay up all night. Right now, it seems quiet now. Charlie wonders if he would like to party all night long with Sasha, even with David &amp; his parents too. But mostly, he's been thinking of having dinner with Sasha. Well, at a restaurant he's been dreaming about steaks. All of them, he could eat. Sasha was shocked &amp; doesn't want him fat because he made a mistake eating steaks. Charlie was nervous about his size &amp; doesn't know what to do. Sasha would have to make him go on a diet. All she can make him is to run on a treadmill. \"Keep running while I get you some healthy food &amp; water for lunch,\" she said. Charlie was sorrier than after her birthday party was ruined. He can't help himself eating junk food. He is ignoring at the other dog barking at him while other people were recording at him. Charlie doesn't want to leave because he's still fat &amp; noticing why Sasha opened a fitness center for dogs for this reason. He really wishes he would apologize for his weight, &amp; forget all of his problems. But it was just a dream. When he woke up, nothing will happen again. Charlie needs to remember not to gain weight &amp; went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt midnight, Charlie woke up, because his stomach growls. He tries to ignore a sound every time his stomach growls. He can't help it. \"Ugh, why is this happening? I had a dream of being fat. And I don't want this happen. Okay...\" He looks himself. \"Maybe I'll find something to eat.\" He walks downstairs to the kitchen. His stomach growls again. \"Shut up. I'm trying.\" He looked both ways, hoping Sasha wasn't in a living room, nor a kitchen. He walked to the cabinet, looking for food. He brought a bag of dog food and his bowl, starting to get hungry. He opened a bag and the sound of snoring was Sasha. She was dreaming of being a star. Charlie was nervous about making sounds, trying to pour it into his bowl. If he makes any sound, he would be frightened of her thinking that he would be a thief. So he brings a cloth and put it into his bowl and pour it. He carefully removes the cloth, putting it back where it goes, brings his bowl to a living room and eat his own food. The living room is a mess. David &amp; his parents forgot to clean the entire living room. Charlie ignores one of the foods, like hot dogs, pizzas, &amp; chips. When he finished his foods, he went back to the kitchen and noticed that Sasha was about to wake up. Charlie turns on a water at the sink. He watched her thinking it's a sound of the fountain. Charlie washes his bowl, dries his bowl, &amp; put his bowl and a dog food back in the cabinet, hoping Sasha didn't find him. Right when he passed the living room, his stomach growls and heard Sasha woke up, saying \"Who's there?\" Charlie had no idea, but to hide behind a tv stand, trying to stay quiet. Sasha got into the living room, looking for Charlie, saying, \"Charlie? Are you there?\" Charlie was scared of getting caught. Even though he saw a spider crawling up at him. He tried not to scream, nor yelp. A spider crawls off of his stomach when it growls again. Sasha caught his scent &amp; his sound, saying, \"Charlie? Is that you?\" Great, now I'm caught! I don't know what to do, he thought. Sasha got close to a tv stand, sniffing something until she found Charlie's tail. Actually, she finds his tail, asking herself why is he hiding there. When she popped her head to Charlie, he gasped, falling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">(NOTE: IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY I MADE, OR IF YOU WANT TO DELETE MY CHAPTER OR OTHER REASON, YOU MAY DELETE MY CHAPTER.

The crowd started cheering as they always did before, glad that this story finally had its ending. <br>\r\n\u201cMy, what a tale. That Moon King sounds simply horrible,\u201d Said the man in the crowd who was a recent citizen who did not know that HE was the evil foe who had his memory wiped from the battle. <br>\r\nKubo bowed along with the miniature origami version of himself. He appreciated everyone\u2019s support and praise for he loved that fact that his stories entertained them. There was however one audience member in particular who loved his stories; Kameyo the kindly young woman who had taken him under her wing these last few days when the boy lost his mother along with his father. <br>\r\nShe was the last one standing after the crowd dispersed and the villagers went back to their daily lives.<br>\r\n\u201cWell done, Kubo!\u201d She chuckled as she approached the lad. \u201cAbout time you finished that story!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Kameyo. But maybe I can give it a little more details next time,\u201d Kubo said modestly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, it was great! Don\u2019t change a word,\u201d The kindly woman said as she gave him a hug that could snap him in half if she squeezed any harder.  <br>\r\nThis boy was truly a bright spot in the old widow\u2019s life. Hardly anyone else in the town seemed as willing to talk to her like he did. She also couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the poor child for what he went through. Sorry enough to take him as her grandson until he was old enough to live on his own.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think a story like that earns you an extra big feast tonight,\u201d Kameyo declared excitedly. She had a lot of worries about Kubo but she was especially concerned for the little guy\u2019s health. He was practically a skeleton and she now found the perfect excuse to give him the fattening she thought he needed. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay. I think your usual rice with soup would be good enough,\u201d the little samurai said, not wanting Kameyo to overdo it with the cooking and feeding. <br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! Just look at yourself,\u201d she stepped back pinching his cheek with a sad look on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re as thin as a bamboo shoot. What did you and your poor mother have to eat in that cave? Rocks?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Kubo lied lightly tapping away her pinching hand. To be honest, he WAS often hungry living with his mother and went to sleep more than one night with his stomach loudly growling.<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to eat! I won\u2019t have you starving in my home,\u201d Kameyo said, almost pleadingly to show her loving grandmother side.<br>\r\nKubo looked into her eyes and felt almost bad for dismissing her pleas to feed him. She clearly wanted only the best for him, including the food that he ate so that he was healthy and happy.  Sure, he was wary about the idea of her making him a feast that covered the whole table but it sounded good to indulge after all those years of only eating enough to stop him from wasting away.<br>\r\n\u201cO.K. But just for tonight. I won\u2019t want you to turn me into the world\u2019s youngest sumo wrestler,\u201d Said Kubo trying to make light of her worries.<br>\r\n Kameyo beamed at the skinny lad and laughed heartedly at his statement. <br>\r\n\u201cFantastic! When we get home, you just wait about an hour or so while I work on your dinner,\u201d <br>\r\nThe two walked home, Kubo preparing himself for the feast and Kameyo still laughing internally over his \u201cworld\u2019s youngest sumo wrestler,\u201d comment.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a silly idea\u2026...\u201d She thought sneakily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was quite weary of how much the kind old woman was expecting him to eat tonight. However, something inside filled him with eagerness to indulge for once in his life. Besides, the last great meal he had was with two people whom he had no idea were his parents at the time and he thought it would be nice to have the same experience with someone whom he had been close to for some time. But he had to remember that it would be just be for nights like this and if he was full, he would stop eating immediately. He intended to keep his samurai figure in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kameyo was quite focused in her kitchen. As she chopped the vegetables into the simmering pot, took the large roast duck out of the Kamado and proceeded to season it, and made sure the rice was plentiful enough to make a suitable first course. She was absolutely determined to make this the best food Kubo would have in his young life. She also made it her own mission to eat as little as possible so that almost all the food would end up in the boy\u2019s stomach instead. She would be devastated if he did not walk away with this meal more stuffed than he had ever been or that he did not need to loosen his sash at least an inch.

The long table in front of him was decorated with roasted goose and duck, sushi, rice, miso soup, noodles, curry, dumplings, soup, and tempura. Behind it all was a beaming Kameyo who obviously noticed the boy\u2019s entranced look. Somehow, he had grown ten times more starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks pretty tempting, huh kiddo?\u201d said the old woman with a face that combined smug and encouraging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026.yeah. It does. But\u2026.I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m probably not hungry enough for all of it,\u201d said Kubo. Quickly, a roar from his stomach followed causing Kameyo to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems your belly begs to differ,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll see how much I can put away,\u201d the lad said as he got down on his knees and picked up the chopsticks on his side of the table. He then placed a piece of everything and slowly put the first sushi in his mouth. The taste was otherworldly. It felt to Kubo as if he had actually eaten food for the first time of his life, and he wanted to finish all the rest that was on his plate, so he dug in with gusto. He had known that Kameyo was a kindly woman but she clearly put every bit of her heart into this food. Before he knew it, his plate was empty and there was an amazing feeling in his stomach that he could not remember the last time he had.  He gave a content sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Kameyo in her usual loving voice. She noticed the warm smile on Kubo\u2019s face and it filled her with so much love knowing that her hard work was being paid off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, Kameyo!\u201d said Kubo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad, you can\u2019t finish it all\u2026.\u201d She teased him. The reply was exactly what she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I mean\u2026.I think I can\u2026\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so nice to know. And remember if you ever feel like you have no more room, that\u2019s what belches are for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That\u2019s not very polite, is it?\u201d asked Kubo blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to make an exception at this time. Besides, table manners are overrated,\u201d said Kameyo wrly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO.K.\u201d Kubo smiled as he proceeded with his second helpings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is my last chapter for this story.

Yesterday his mom took his older sister, Amy to college leaving him stuck at home with his dad and his baby brother Adam. Earlier his father, Wayne took the two of them to the lab where he works and unbeknownst to the two older men, Adam got in the way of the size ray when they tried to grow his stuffed bunny. Couple of hours have passed by and Wayne left Nick to babysit Adam. \"Dad, why do I have to look after the little brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Nick, it'll only be for a little bit. I got a call from work and I gotta get back to the lab to help out. Also I don't want them to find out we were there earlier.\" Wayne whispered that last part to Nick as he strung the strings on his guitar which his kid brother was messing around with earlier. With no choice, the sixteen year old grunted and accepted watching his little bro as their father drove off in the family van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright squirt. Its time for your lunch.\" The curly haired boy simply cheered as he was put in his high chair as Nick put his macaroni and cheese in the microwave before going to the phone and calling his crush, Mandy to see if she would like to come over. As Adam was left alone in the kitchen, he pulled out the table on his high chair and hopped off, not liking being stuck in one place for too long. The two year old gets closer to the microwave as blue electricity sparks out of it and wraps around the boy. (Just like in the movie, he grows larger but now his weight gets bigger too.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingly sensation courses through Adam Szalinski's body, tickling the little tyke as Nick enters the kitchen. \"Yeah, so if you are free this afternoon, you have my address. I'll see ya.\" The teen ends the phone call and sees his brother as he starts to grow. The blond two year old gets taller and taller, his height reaching up past the dinner table, the kitchen counter, eventually past Nick's eye level until he is looking up at his once little brother. Luckily his clothes grow along with him in proportion to his body but it starts getting tight on him as he gets fatter and fatter. His cheeks fill up followed by his jowls inflating like a water balloon until his cherubic face morphs into a bloated double chin chubster's. His gut pushes forward on his red coveralls becoming the biggest part of him as the baby looks like he is carrying a baby with how round his tummy expands. His chest follows too as he goes from flat to b-cup man boobs against his yellow shirt, the toddler's hips flare out, knocking over some of the chairs next to him as he develops love handles which makes room for his blubber butt as each cheek bursts outward until he gets an impressive dump truck. Adam's arms and legs thicken to tree trunk levels with his thunder thighs and flabby turkey wings, Nick is rubbing his eyes as he can't believe he is seeing his once small brother's now massive frame taking up most of the space in the kitchen. \"Adam. Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Brudda now little Brudda.\" The titanic toddler giggles which causes his chubby face and gut to jiggle like jello as his older but now smaller brother tries to figure out what to do next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nick just stares at the fat, blubbery blob that use to be his little baby brother now stands taller than him in his yellow shirt and red overalls that struggle to contain his girth. He just knows that those coveralls are compressing more blubber like a girdle and he does not want to see it ware out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen.\" The glasses wearing teen talks to himself as Adam helps himself to the macaroni and cheese in the microwave. The toddler's new height allows him to reach the appliance with little to no effort. \"This has to do with the size ray. There is no other explanation but it shouldn't have made Adam big like... this. Dad will know how to fix it. I just gotta keep Adam safe until he gets back.\" Looking back over his shoulder, Nick sees his big, blob of a brother inhaling the cheesy plate in one big bite, his yellow covered tongue licking his lips like he was Jabba the Hutt. \"Don't worry Adam. Dad will fix you when he gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry.\" Adam pats his bloated belly with his sausage sized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Adam, I'll see whats in the fridge.\" The older Szalinski sibling turned his back and looked inside the refrigerator to see what his bro would like but the answer would be everything. Nick is pushed to the side as the hungry giant waddled  over and began raiding the fridge, grabbing everything with his pudgy hands and shoveling them down his wide open mouth. The older boy watched in fascination as he watched Adam's chubby cheeks and double chins flap around as food disappears down his throat. Left over spaghetti,rotisserie chicken, even a large hoagie sandwich went down his mouth as he chomped away at it. He was like that pig monster from that one episode of Power Rangers, he didn't even take out the bones of the chicken, just eating every part of it. \"Alright Adam, that's enough. You need to stop.\" The geeky teen tries to stop the obese giant, pushing against his body but the boy's hands just sink into  the squishy gut like it was memory foam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry.\" The baby behemoth groans as he turns to his brother, grabbing Nick by the shoulders. Adam opened his mouth wide. Nick looked on in fear as he sees the pink lips separate and the pearly white row of teeth stretch out. The teen yells as his head was shoved into his two year old brother's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T EAT ME!\" Nick Szalinski screamed at the top of his lungs but his pleas were muffled by his captors cheeks as Adam sucked on his brother's head like a sucker. The glasses wearing nerd continued screaming until the slimy toddler's tongue rolled along his face and inserted into his mouth. He wasn't sure what was worst, being vored or the non consenting french kiss. The slippery muscle exited the teen's mouth, then went down his chest and into his shirt through the neck hole as the tip wipes around and pokes his erect nipples. That wasn't the only thing erect as Nick had the weirdest boner right now, he isn't enjoying this but his body in a state of panic is showing signs of arousal as his hard pecker pokes into the bulbous boy's belly fat. He is pushed further into the mouth until Nick's head was at the back of Adam's throat. He looked down at the dark cavern that lead to the stomach, the nerdy boy fought and shuffled until his glasses fell off and disappeared down the pitch black cave.\"LET ME OUT!\" As if his prayers have been answered, Adam pulled out his smaller big brother who's upper half is drenched in the toddler's saliva. Nick falls down on his but as he hyperventilates, his whole life flashing before his eyes as he experienced a near death experience and also the second time he was almost eaten by a family member. A load rumbling was then heard inside Adam's stomach that started moving upwards until.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant baby boy let out a boisterous belch that lasted long enough to break several world records. His fat cheeks and jowl vibrating as his mouth hung wide open letting a gust of foul smelling hot air out while his pudgy hands pushed on his bloated gut to expel the horrid gas. It ended as Nick's glasses flew out of Adam's pie hole as his finished up his burp. Nick hesitantly picked them up with his thumb and index finger as his bifocals were covered in transparent slime, the geeky teen flicking off the excessive goo after getting up then going to the sink to rinse them off along with his face. The older brother then lured Adam into the living room with cartoons on the TV as he went to change his shirt to one that didn't look like it was covered in Nickelodeon slime.</span></div></div>",
