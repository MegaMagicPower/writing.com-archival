While he noted his highschool experience had been relatively easy going, this year was a whole new era. He was finally a senior, and that meant that for the first time, he and his friends would be the big dogs on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Morning approached, Ross awoke and found that he was actually elated to wake up; he was going to see all his buddies together for the first time since school had ceased for the summer. Summer was always happily welcomed but with everyone's hectic schedules it would be nice to see everyone in one place for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appearance of a new school year also meant the beggining of a new football season, and Ross couldn't wait to be back out on the field feeling the momentum of a hardworking tem unit striving to be the champions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all these thoughts buzzing in his head Ross hopped out of bed and began to get ready for school. He got into the shower and got dressed relatively quick, he had never been much of a morning guy but all of the new school year buzz had him energized and ready to go, there was only one problem. You see, as Ross had figured out from a young age, he had more than an...ample butt. He noticed early on that his butt was alot more larger in width and girth in general than any other guys in school. As highschool came into play he earned the name BB from some of the gossiping girls in short for big booty. Things only became more apparent when he started to become more active with sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootball tights left no imagination to the mind when it came to his butt, baseball slacks only further accentuated the shape and volume of it, and wrestling slings were an unimaginably tight squeeze to fit into. Ross had given up on track altogether when he realized the petite nylon shorts simply couldn't withstand the gyrating that his thick globes produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss had become resitant to the routine of getting ready, and the somewhat annoying hassle that came  when it was time to put on his boxers. Nevertheless he managed to pull them up without much difficulty, but like always the garment felt noticeably tight around his butt. the real surprising challenge came when it was time to put on his shorts. it didn't make alot of sense because his shorts were always really saggy and large, but somehow, even when he wore them low, they always seemed to tug at his butt. After a few minutes of work, jumping about with extremly silly effort, the shorts snuggly came on and Ross triumphantly went downstairs to get some breakfast before heading off to school. When he got downstairs his mom was at the dinner table reading the newspaper and having a cup of coffee. \"Hey mom,\" he said as he rummaged through the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey honey, ready for your last year of school?\" she said, trying not to sound too proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, finally the day has come.\" Ross lightly laughed. He made himself some cereal and snacked on a banana, but after he was done eating he couldn't help but still feel a little empty. He figured that maybe the butterflies from going back to school might have amped up his apetite so just to make sure he grabbed the pancake mixture and made some pancakes to grubb on (4 fluffy stacked flapjacks to be exact). After he finished his ravenous devour he grabbed his back pack and his keys and headed rushed off to begin his first last day of highschool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nto let you know, Ross has aubrey colored hair and a olive tan complextion. he has somewhat definition of abs and has some ripped muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nso what happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jonsey turned sharply to see Ross and he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Ross, what's up? ready for the first day of school, cuz i'm sure not.\" Jonsey laughed and continued shoving his school materials into his locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I feel so energized, i can't wait to see everyone again, and not to mention football tryouts of course.\" Ross gave Jonsey a playful punch to the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh yeah, i almost forgot all about that, man this years going to be great now that were seniors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know, i can't believe it.

Jonsey, Ross's best friend noticed Ross's weird behavior and asked what was wrong. \"Dude, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, im fine, just bored...i guess.\" Jonsey stared at him before leaving him alone. \"Come on, come on, come on...\" Ross whispered staring at the clock. half a minute to go and then he could go to the cafetieria and get something to eat, like pizza, or a taco, or something deep fried and tasty. Ross became aware of the fact that he was drooling and quickly snapped back to reality. RING!!!!! the time had come and lunch was officially here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss jumped up from his desk, grabbed his stuff and jetted out of the room and to his locker as fast as he could. when he got to his locker he jammed his stuff inside and practicly ran to the cafeteria. he scanned the signs and read them off carefully trying to see what food was served up today. salad? what the keck where they trying to serve him? then he saw it, today was basco sticks, pizza, and spaghetti. \"oh thank you,\" Ross muttered to himself before rushing to the line and grabbing two basco sticks, a large side of spaghetti, and two slices of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss could smell the fresh aromas as he headed to the lunch table where his friends were flooded around. Ross sat down at the table and begun to digg in without even saying a word to any of his friends. \"Dang Ross, that's a lot of food,\" Jonsey said staring at Ross in amazement as Ross stuffed the food into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i guess\" Ross was able to blurt out in between bites. by the time he was done most of his friends had left the lunch table and went to go flirt with some girls or hang out somewhere else. Ross stood up and stretched, he was actually only half way full, but for now it would do.</span></div></div>",

Ross had no idea why, but for some reason Ross was always thinking about food recently, he had dreams about food and it was getting to the point to where he had to pack 5 granola bars in his back pack so that he could have one every class or so, so that he could keep focused on his classes. Ross didn't really notice it much or really care, but Jonsey noticed Ross's sudden interest in food, and a few of Ross's other friends noticed too. Brady, Ross's second best friend noticed the interest when he saw Ross shoveling three bags of cheetos into his backpack at the vending machine. overall Ross maintained his grades and who cared if he ate a bit more than usual right?</span></div></div>",

Ross, himself remained oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing!! Ross's alarm clock rung in the morning and Ross lumbered out of bed. \"Uh,\" he murmured to himself as he headed to his closet. he didn't really care what he wore today so he picked out the first thing in his closet and started throwing it on. he had picked out a grey-v-collar-t-shirt, and a pair of red, basketball shorts. He started getting dressed and didn't notice the slight difficulties since he was used to struggleing to get his shorts on. but this time it was alot different, from the slight weight gain some of his weight must have went to his butt because it was a little larger than before, and his shirt was a little snugg around his stomach, but Ross took no notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>a month had gone by already and Ross was exited by the fact that football was going to be coming up soon. little did he notice the change in his body. none of his friends said anything although they seemed to be aware of the weight gain. none of them realized just how much of a gain Ross had until the thursday of that week. Ross came to school in a plain white t-shirt and some green basketball shorts (thursdays where always his lazy days). Ross was in science with Jonsey when Jonsey started seeing the change in Ross. Jonsey and Ross where always bestfriends since middleschool, but Jonsey had to admit that he was always a bit jealous of Ross. growing up Ross was always the best, not to say that Jonsey was lame or ugly, but it was hard to be impressive when you're standing next to Ross. Ross was the rockstar in sports and he had charm with the chicas. Jonsey was always the wingman, but lately he noticed Ross was more into the chicken wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe science class met outside today because they were experimenting the affects of the sun. Well, after a few minutes of standing in the sun listening to Mrs. Yeilds, the sun started to get to you. 12 minutes in and the class was laying on the ground trying not to sweat to death. once the class had finished their assingment they had free time to themselfs. the guys decided to play a game of football to keep them energized. Ross, being the all-star sportsman, and mister popular joined in the game and took lead as one of the captains. While playing Jonsey noticed Ross's huffing and puffing as they ran around tackling each other and scoring goals. Jonsey didn't think much of it unitl he went in for a tackle and successfully took Ross down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonsey saw Ross fall to the ground and as he did his shirt lifted up a good centimeter above his navil. Jonsey was sure no one else saw, but he saw all to well Ross's stomach. there was a tiny happy trail that could be seen, but barely. and then Jonsey noticed that there was no sign of abs at all on Ross. Ross's tan stomach puffed out a bit and it rolled up as he menuverd to get up. Thats when Jonsey saw the biggest effect on Ross. his butt had, unbelieveably gotten bigger. Jonsey had noticed a long time ago that Ross had a big rump, but this, this was just plain ridiculous. the weight gain had added extra padding to his butt, and he noticed it was more rounder, and jiggly, it was firm but meaty, and it shook with just the slightest step. Jonsey had no idea how Ross was fitting into his shorts with a butt that big; he noted that the jawstrings pressed tightly into Ross's butt and the material was stressed out tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady too noticed Ross's weight gain, it was after school. all the football players had a short meeting today on what they could expect the rest of the season to be like. Brady was in the locker room changing when Ross came in and started changing himself. Brady, unlike his friends, had a weird attraction to men, although he knew he wasn't gay. he couldn't help but watch Ross as he peeled of his clothing. first the shirt came off, revealing a firm layer of pudgy fat that shoved it's way at least two inches over his waistband. and once the shirt was off Brady got a good look at Ross's growing butt. it was juicy and raw, and it pounded as Ross jumped up and down as he tried to balance himself, trying to get his shoes on. it was weird seeing Ross, one of the fittest guys in school, now a pudgy, tubby guy, but it was also really hot, brady noted.</span></div></div>",

Ross, of course was the most popular guy in school, so he had lots of friends; and it seemed the more his friends hung around Ross, the more they eat with him. soon, without notice, some of his friends were also eating as badly as him, and with the food came the weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrady was the first, Brady, standing at 6,1 ft, would mostlikely not gain weight easily becasue of his longer body, but this was not the case. Brady has short light brown hair and green bright eyes mind you. Brady didn't notice the weight gain, but it certainly showed. Jonsey, yet again noticed the developing of a thicker chin on Brady. along with the growing belly that would press up against his shirts once in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonsey, never thinking twice, also picked up on the habit and started gaining weight. Jonsey has dark black hair, and a mexican tan. Jonsey out of all the friends gained the most without a thought. it started with his abs, they faded and then fat replaced them. his but balloned up, nothing to the size of Ross's but bigger than it had been. it seemed as if all of Ross's friends gained weight as the season progressed. but Coach Waymer wasn't going to have it. Football was starting this week and he saw the changes in his players. Justin, Tyler, Mark, Brady, Darren, Jonsey, Geoff, even his star player Ross, they all started to develop paunchs and guts and big butts. with the exception of Ross who had always had a big butt. He had to do soemthing to get his team back in shape.</span></div></div>",

Their first game was a total crap fest, as the final score came to Home=12 to opponent=23. Coach was less to say thrilled; he didn't know what to do, all the workouts seemed to have little effect on the boys growing guts and drilling them at practice only made them more lazy during games. He was ready to give up until a thought came to mind. Maybe if he could get the trouble maker or the starter of all this weight gain, maybe, just maybe he could get this problem under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo coach did some investigating, using endless hours of school videos in order to find the first person who first started gaining weight. Finally coach found the starter, and boy was he surprised; his star, his personal favorite Ross, was the first to gain weight! this came as a total shock, but eitheir way coach was going to do what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss was walking down to the football field, he was already wondering about what deadly practice they were going to have today when he herd someone calling his name. \"Ross!\" He turned around to see Coach waving him over. oh great, Ross thought, what does he want, is he gunna yell at me for my lack of effort? Ross walked to the coach nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ross, can i talk to you for a minute?\" Coach watched as Ross walked closer, His uniform clung tightly to his gut and coach saw that Ross's face had filled out a bit, it was weird seeing Ross plumped up. He had never thought that his star player would let himself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah coach?\" Ross came to a halt infront of him and his stomach gave a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ross, i was just wanted to ask you a little favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i've noticed that you and a couple of the team members have been slacking off lately, and you're the leader of this squad. so i'm asking you to show some more enthusiasm and show interest so that the rest of the members will be a little more hard-working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh, yeah, sure thing.\" Coach couldn't break his star like he would any other member, it just wasn't in him to yell at his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that's it, now go on, tell the guys that were doing five laps around the track and them going to the weight room for the rest of the day, sorta give you a break, i know it's been kinda rough lately. tell the guys to get changed into some gym clothes today too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss nodded and then ran to tell the guys the new information. Or at least he tried to run, it looked like he was fast walking except he was bouncing up and down. It was painful to see Ross so pudgy, his enormous butt flopped up and down like jello and his belly pumped up and down with every shaking step.</span></div></div>",

Ross's newly gained gut was clear in sight underneath his shirt and his shorts looked stressed out to where they looked uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ross...oh, can i talk to you for a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well i was just...it's hard to say...but, Ross you need to shape up, if you don't im going to have to cut you out of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? coach what do you mean? i...i know i haven't been giving it my all, but come on, it's senior year, coach please don't cut me, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ross, it's you weight gain, ever since you started putting on weight you've gotten lazy.\" Ross gave coach a blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...weight gain?\" This was clearly hard for coach to say to Ross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ross, you've put on weight, your getting...chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost your abs and replaced them by fat, and your butt's gotten huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...i'm gunna go, i'll talk to you later coach.\" Ross tried to walk away fastly but he got embarresed when he realised his cheeks were rubbing together, causing them to shake wildly. Had he really let himself go? was coach right? Ross had to investigate some more.</span></div></div>",

The gang had no idea why the coach was being so no-nonsense at practice; but it was beginning to get on their nerves. Not to mention that each practice was now extended another half hour. The coach also mentioned that if they wanted to do well then they'd all have to go on strict diets, no one knew why, but they had no choice to follow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, they couldn't just sit there and eat nothing. Ross's cravings were getting even worse and Coach's diet cut out all the things he loved to eat. No fast food, desserts, barely any carbs, just the basic food groups in there plain boring and dull ways. The diet and practices went into affect two days ago and Ross hated it. This was the worst time he could ever imagine having. Life was extremely dull and difficult. Not to mention that the coach had talked to all their parents about the practice and diet so there was no slacking at home either; no time to pig out or eat what he wanted to, he was forced to eat just as healthy at home as he did at school. Ross had, had enough; he decided to hold a meeting in the cafeteria the next day with all the football players to discuss what to do about all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you guys, i've called you all here to talk about our current situation.\" Ross was huddled around the entire football team; they had snuck in after school for this ergent meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What situation?\" Jonsey asked arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The diet and practice situation; i don't know about you guys, but this diet thing is ridiculous. Were seniors! were going to be going to college next year, we can't be treated like little kids anymore, we decide what we do, not our parents. Our parents will have no say over us next year, were going to be out on our own and they need to realize that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i agree, sorta, but...i dont know about rebelling against them, they're our parents after all, they want whats best for us.\" Brady said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can do what you want momma's boy, but i say we brake some rules.\" They all laughed, even Brady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you suggest we do about this situation Ross?\" Jonsey said sarcasticly. Ross looked at him with a smile and then went on with the fake dramatic moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen! we have a serious issue on our hands! we are being told that we cannot eat what we want to, what we need to! we need to take action, but use stealth.\" Ross laughed. \"I say we need a hideout soemwhere, where we can stash all the food we want to eat and then eat it there; that way we don't have to upset our parents, or the coach.\" They all looked around at each other, it seemed a little kid-ish, but hey, a guy's gotta do what a guys gotta do. Ross jumped on the cafeteria table they were gathered around and pumped his fist in the air. \"Are you with me!?\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" they all yelled and joined in cheers. this was a fool proof plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey plotted out all the details and came up with the perfect safe place; they had three spots were they would stash the food. For school they would stash the food in the equipment room. when they were at home they would stash food at the restuarant Champs that Nathan worked at that was close enough for them all to go to. And the third was at the woods that they all used to hang out in when they were in middle school<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were men, and all men put at least a few pounds--why try to fight nature?  His players were naturally getting a little rounder in the middle, so he decided to let his players decide for themselves how they wanted there bodies to look--it shouldn't concern him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day though, Coach realized that it may have had more of an effect than he anticipated.  He had planned out an easy practice just to get his players back into the groove of things:  2 laps around the track, stretching, pushups, and a half hour of drills.  As some players started trotting out of the locker room and onto the field, he could already see a change in lots of the seniors--they were lazy jogging out, and clearly filled out their uniforms more tightly.  Then he saw his star player, Ross, lazily trot out of the locker room.  He couldn't get a good view of Ross's stomach since his shoulder pads were on, but he had clearly let himself go at least a little.  His massive butt jiggled on top of his meaty thighs, straining his tights to a point where they were nearly see-through.  After the 2 warmup laps, Ross approached Coach Waymer, huffing, puffing and drenched in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach, I.....don't......feel........so.......great.\" Ross managed to say, through his intense breathing.  Ross bent over, attempting to catch his breath.  \"This padding's so heavy, it's making it really hard to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Ross,\"  Coach Waymer remembered he told himself not to fight nature, and so was very understanding.  \"Why don't you stretch some and then go home--I can't risk anything happening to my star player.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks alot Coach.\"  Ross pulled up his jersey to wipe the sweat off his face, giving coach a clear view at what used to be Ross's six pack.  Now, it had turned into a rounded, albeit small, jiggling sign of his overindulgence. turning around to walk back towards the locker room, Ross's titanic butt cheeks jiggled with every slow, pounding step he took.</span></div></div>",

Ross's eyes were immediately dragged to his midsection, with 3 litle rolls sitting on top of his tights, right where his chiseled abs had been.  Ross had no idea why Jonsey was here, or how he had managed to chub himself up, and so asked him.  It turns out Jonsey was trying to avoid practicing, as he knew he was far too out of shape to handle it.  Looking at Jonsey's gut as he stood up and then seeing his ass bulging through the back of his tights, Ross couldn't help but agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoss suggested to Jonsey that they change and go grab a bite to eat, and Jonsey couldn't have agreed more.  Both guys, eagerly anticipating a chance to fill themselves up, hurriedly stripped out of their uniforms.  As they pulled their tights off, Ross got a good look at Jonsey's bare, pale ass.  Compared to the last time he noticed it, it had really filled out.  Set ontop of a new pair of beefier thighs, Ross saw that his gut wasn't the only part of him that fattened up.  Not that Ross was in a better spot--he had done his fair share of overindulging, and it showed all over his body.  Once back into their normal clothes, which didn't make them appear much thinner, Ross and Jonsey left in Ross's car, unsure of their destination--although their little guts, jiggling and growling with every bump in the road, knew exactly what they wanted.</span></div></div>",

He really wanted to fondle those big babies in the darkness of the theater.but would she welcome that or not.  She seemed happy snuggling with him and she cared enough to bring him food.  He wouldn't have given it a second thought with those sonority chicks but Candy was special.   Maybe she wouldn't fall into his arms.  Maybe she wanted more time to get to know him first.

He was eating healthy and light, drinking wine and eating cheese rather than beer and pizza and Candy seemed to like him. He was getting mellow.

She was cooking something. She turned around and saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, You\u2019re up. I making breakfast some pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs sound okay. \u201csaid Candy as she smiled. Ross went felt a stirring downstairs. He quickly composed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sound great, um where is the bathroom.\u201d said Ross as he really had to go and also freshen himself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bathroom is down the hall and first door on your left.\u201d said as she went back to cooking up breakfast.  Ross nodded and went to the bathroom. After he did his business and freshened up he pulled up his jacket and shirt and saw that this bloated belly went down. He let out a sigh of relief as he put his jacket and shirt down. What he didn\u2019t see is that his six packs abs lost some definition. He exited the bathroom and went back to the kitchen and saw Candy setting the counter for two. He sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you like my breakfast. \u201csaid Candy. A hidden talent very people now about her is that she is culinary genius as she can make some of the hardest dishes look easy. Due to her talent many culinary colleges are offer her free scholarships when they saw her videotapes on making very difficult food dishes.  She huge a huge stack of pancakes with a luge portion of fried bacon and scrambled eggs and huge mug filled with orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExpecting an army. \u201csaid Ross light heartily as he could no way eat all of the food in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo just wanted to use some of ingredients before they go bad.\u201d said Candy, as she just had a bowl of fruit with yogurt and granola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I hear you need a tutor in a few subject \u201csaid Candy trying to make a conversation. Soon Ross talked about what classes his failing or just barley passing. Candy noticed that with each explanation he slowly started to eat and was distraction how slowly the food disappeared right into his belly. She saw that his belly started to slowly budge out due to the great amount of food. They next talked about how Candy would tutor him at her apartment as she was the top of all the class she has as several of her classes are advance courses. She learned that Ross was hoping for a sport scholarship as he has grades. Candy told him to don\u2019t worry about his grades as her tutoring will make his grades will rise.  Their conversation went for over an hour and by the time their conversation was done. Ross had eaten all of the food placed in front of him and his belly looked just as round as the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for listening to me and for the future tutoring. \u201csaid Ross as he yawned as he got up and felt a bit tired. He didn\u2019t notice his bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. Anything to help you. \u201csaid Candy as she washed the empty dishes. Ross nodded and went to couch and fell down on it and soon went to take a nap to disgust all the food he has eaten. Candy soon hear snoring coming from the couch and just smiled. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mark was the nice guy of the crowd, he was average height with a tiny goatee and mild afro. He along with the others were part of the football team. They set off for the trip on thursday, packing up and hitting the road. Most of the day was spent in the cramped truck. Mark drove and Jonsey sat shotgun reading off directions. Brady sat behind Mark and jammed to his ipod with Shaun, and then Ross, Ross sat behind Jonsey munching away on assorted foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonsey checked the rear veiw mirrior at various times, only to see Ross stuffing his face non stop. This was the type of weird behavior Jonsey had been talking about; what was up with Ross lately? eventually when they hit Illinois at night they stopped at a gas station to fill up gas and hit the restrooms. Mark took in a deep breath, \"Man, that's alot of driving man, and where almost there thank god.\" he chuckled as did Jonsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, man tomorrow's going to be awesome, that is if these guys ever wake up,\" He looked at the back seat to see all three guys sleeping. \"Hey! wake up guys!\" he slapped their knees and they all slowly woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there already?\" Shaun asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost, no thanks to you guys,\" Martin laughed as he exited the car.

There was nothing but trees all around them.<br>\r\n\"You boys lost?\" came a voice back in the woods.<br>\r\nMark looked over to see two strapping men break through the forest.<br>\r\n\"This detour seems to be a dead end.\"  Mark began.  He was relieved to have company and these two men looked like they knew their way around the woods.<br>\r\nThe first guy smiled showing ragged teeth.  He was a big guy, strong but with a big gut as well bulging out of a flannel shirt that couldn't hope to button around it.<br>\r\n\"The county road crew up here don't amount to much.  They probably forgot to mark the turnoff.  You boys out for a wild weekend on your own?\"<br>\r\nUp close the smile didn't make him look friendly.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"  Mark responded politely.

Meanwhile big Jethro was not on the other side of the road and when the car stopped, he crammed his bulk inside.<br>\r\n\"So long boys.  You've got about 10 miles back to the nearest phone.  Hope that's wild enough for you.\"<br>\r\nThey watched the cloud of dust settle.<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"  Shaun said trying to get a signal on his cellphone.  <br>\r\n\"We walk.\"  Mark said.<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.

Let him go and send someone back to get us.\"  Ross was adamant.  \"I'm waiting right here while you hotshots go.<br>\r\nFinally Mark and Shaun set out for help while Brady stayed with Ross.  Four hours later the rescue party had called in the Sheriff to rescue Brady and Ross but when they got to the end of the road both boys were gone.  They searched for hours with no luck.

They never should have tried a shortcut out of the woods and even more they never should have knocked on the door of the cabin and finally, no matter how hungry they were, they never should have stayed for dinner.<br>\r\nThe officer in charge shrugged his head as they hiked back to their car. <br>\r\n\"Those inbred hillbillies!\" he muttered to his partner.  \"It's a wonder they can still function.\"<br>\r\nDaisy watched the officer and then turned to the boys.<br>\r\n\"You boys are the answer to my prayers.\"  she told them.  \"My two worthless sons just left me.

His dirty brown hair was thicker, darker and getting frizzy.  His beard was coming in red as was the new pelt on his chest.  The boys shared an attic room and a double bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir days started with work.  Rufus chopped wood for an hour while Cletus cooked up breakfast.  Breakfast was hearty,  Eggs and country sausage; biscuits and gravy, grits and syrup.  Rufus needed a big breakfast but Cletus matched him and then mopped up any leftovers.  Both boys were getting bigger in their new life.  Rufus grew a broad muscular chest and big arms from his labors while Cletus grew a big soft belly.  Daisy couldn't be happier.  They were eating her out of supplies but she couldn't argue with their dedication.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma.\"  Both boys called her Ma.  \"I ripped my pants.\"  Cletus was looking at her with embarrassment.<br>\r\nDaisy sighed. That boy was big as a barn.  Still she couldn't complain.<br>\r\n\"What happened, boy?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"I was bending over to get the biscuits out of the oven and I must have caught them on something.\"  Cletus was standing in his skivvies looking at his pants.  The seat had blown out.<br>\r\n\"You need to be more careful son.  I'm not made of money.  I'll have to get you another pair next time I go to town.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes'm. I'm real sorry.  I will be more careful.\"<br>\r\n\"My shirt ripped too.\"  Rufus had come in and stood in the kitchen shirtless holding a ripped shirt. <br>\r\nDaisy looked at him with wonder.  He had a big chest on him.  Almost like some body builder.<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it,\"  Daisy snapped.  \"Now you two get back to work.

You'll be fine until I get to the store.\"<br>\r\nOver the next months, Rufus grows into a muscle monster, he can chop wood forever and life huge rocks into place building walls on the place.  Cletus just gets fatter.  Sharing a bed in the cold winter helped the boys appreciate each other more.  Rufus appreciated the warmth from fat Cletus and Cletus loved to cuddle in Rufus strong arms. One thing led to another and the boys became lovers as well.<br>\r\nDaisy kept them dosed with the elixer but she didn't realize that as the boys grew, she needed more elixer to keep them in their dependent situation.  The muscular and active Rufus began to start remembering their old life first.  But it only seemed like a dream because it was so outlandish to imagine another life.  Gradually he became convinced that he had to try escape.  Cletus wouldn't believe but he was so dependent on Rufus that he finally agreed to follow his lead.  So the next time Daisy went to town Rufus led Cletus down the trail.</span></div></div>",
