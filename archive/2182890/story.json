They use an ancient, psychic Sigilyph on board to divine exactly what part of the world needs its help the most, and then the entire guild sails there, dropping its anchor on the shore and dispatching its members to help the hapless townsfolk of whatever land they've traveled to! For the Pokemon of the world, seeing those familiar sails approach over the horizon is a beacon of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust today, it's anchored at the docks of a beautiful new small town - <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/home.png\" alt=\"*Home*\" title=\"Home\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>Juniper Town</b>! Once known for its beautiful flowers and agriculture, the town now more closely resembles a mountainous desert, almost unrecognizable from what it once was. It seems that the town has been experienced an extreme drought for quite a while now, ever since they heard a strange roar in the nearby mountains. Rumor has it that Groudon might be involved! This town definitely needs someone to help fix their drought problem, or one day, it might escalate into a whole famine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's where you come in! You'll be dropped into this world as one of its mystical Pokemon inhabitants, and either try and save the world, or just eek out a living however you can. Before we can get to that, though, we'll have to establish what kind of Pokemon you are...</span></div></div>",

But recently, your farm has been being disrupted by nothing less than\u2026 UFOs! It seems like all the time recently, you\u2019ve been seeing strange green lights outside, almost like stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nobody believes you\u2026 and to be fair, you haven\u2019t really been able to catch any photographic evidence at all\u2026 but you\u2019re not crazy or anything! There really is something strange going on around your humble light farm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all came to a head when, one night, while you were trying to sleep, you heard a strange noise outside\u2026 and a powerful, green light started pouring through the window! Started, you wake from your bed\u2026 only to be somehow mesmerized by that green light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a tired daze, you stumble over to the window, staring out into that endless green expanse, until your mind grows foggy and all you can see is that shiny green\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, that green all faded away\u2026 and the floor seemingly collapsed from under you! You were knocked out of your trance all of a sudden, only for your heart to suddenly sink into your chest when you saw where you suddenly were\u2026 somewhere above a strange continent, hundreds of meters above the ground! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d You panicked, your heart pounding in your chest as you suddenly started falling down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what was going on, or why you were suddenly so high in the air all of a sudden! All you could do was brace yourself for what you assumed to be certain death. Indeed, you landed with such force that the nearby trees were blown over by the sheer crater you formed\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to your surprise, you were\u2026 still alive? You let out a long groan, your heart still racing and soreness and nausea wracking your body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you hear noises all around you, like faint footsteps and a voice. All you can think is, thank goodness\u2026 someone\u2019s coming to rescue me! \u201cOh dear! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! Just a sliver of health left\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a voice, as somebody poked and prodded you. \u201cHere, eat these! They\u2019ll make you feel better\u2026\u201d With that, they brought a huge, blue berry to your lips, and without much other options, you started weakly chowing down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, they actually worked! Just eating that berry, you could feel a lot of the pain going away, and your strength returns to you. After they let you chomp down on a second one, you feel just about as good as new, aside from some soreness and a headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you got a good glimpse of your attacker\u2026 but instead of a human, it was some monster you\u2019ve never seen before! Some kind of plump, yellow rodent creature, standing on two legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEek! What are-\u201d You stutter\u2026 only to realize you\u2019re not human anymore either! Your whole body feels different\u2026 and when you look down, you\u2019re a monster like him! Some four-legged creature, with many tails, and covered in fur! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, you realize this monster must be one of those extraterrestrials\u2026 and he had transformed you into one of them! \u201cNooo! Turn me back! Turn me back! I don\u2019t wanna be an alien!\u201d You immediately cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature seemed rather taken aback. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s an alien?\u201d He asked, confused, as if wondering if something was wrong with your head. \u201cWell, whatever it is, you\u2019re not one of em. You\u2019re a vulpix!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, even more confused than he was. \u201c... a\u2026 vulpix?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026 a Pokemon\u2026?\u201d He explained, incredulous, as if this much obvious. \u201cYou really trying to say you never noticed you were a vulpix before? Are you\u2026 sure you didn\u2019t hit your head in that fall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA\u2026 a Pokemon? You\u2019d heard of those things\u2026 seen them in commercials\u2026 but you assumed that it was just some dumb game for kids! If you really were a Pokemon, though\u2026 that clinches it! This all just HAD to be a dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to calm yourself down, convincing yourself you must be having a very vivid and disturbing dream. It would all be over soon\u2026 there was nothing to be afraid of\u2026 \u201cSo\u2026 if I\u2019m a vulpix\u2026 then what kind of Pokemon are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, proudly patting that pot belly of his. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m a pikachu, of course!\u201d You nod. Well, you\u2019ve heard of those, at least. \u201cAnd my name\u2019s Andre! What\u2019s your\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause\u2026 before reaching up a paw, and letting the \u2018pikachu\u2019 pull you up to your feet, and you wobble a bit trying to keep your balance on four feet. Already, you were missing having hands. \u201cMy name\u2019s Kristina\u2026 it\u2019s, uh, nice to meet you, I suppose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pikachu did seem to have nursed you back to health, and for that, you were thankful\u2026 but he still seemed eager to help even more.</span></div></div>",

Aside from your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered telling him the truth\u2026 but figured it\u2019d just make him think you\u2019re a lunatic. \u201cNo, not at all\u2026\u201d You eventually lie, deciding to just play the part of some hopeless amnesiac, in the hopes that\u2019ll get him to give you more info about this world. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember what those berries you\u2019re carrying are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at one of the blue berries he\u2019d taken from his satchel. \u201cOh, these are Oran Berries! They\u2019ll restore your health lickity split! Well, at least for weaker Pokemon like us. For stronger Pokemon, these aren\u2019t very useful\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cWait, if you don\u2019t remember you were a vulpix, does that mean you don\u2019t remember your moves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head. \u201cMy what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez! You\u2019ve forgotten how to do all of your moves? That\u2019s a problem\u2026\u201d He immediately seemed concerned, and you grew a little worried yourself. Eventually, though, he snapped his fingers with a smile. \u201cWell, there\u2019s one move I can teach you right now! Here, just try to jump at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJump at me! Hit me with your whole body! C\u2019mon, I can take it!\u201d He braced himself, with a look of dedication on his face. You were unsure, but you eventually do as he says, rearing back\u2026 and sending yourself flying right at him, preparing to hit him with a body slam!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped right at his pot belly\u2026 and in return, you suddenly bounce off all that soft flesh! \u201cOof!\u201d Your attack completely backfires as his fluffy belly sends you flying backwards, wincing as you land right in the dirt.  \u201cJeez\u2026 that thing is more dangerous than it looks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026 yeah, sorry. It can be pretty bouncy\u2026\u201d He blushed, sheepishly, as he poked his plump tummy. Getting his head back in the game, though, he turned so that his side was now facing you. \u201cAgain! This time, let\u2019s try it from the side!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, but still rear back\u2026 and send yourself flying right at him again! This time, your body slam seems to really get him, and he\u2019s knocked over onto his back with a start. \u201cAgh\u2026 that was a good one! You\u2019re getting the hang of this!\u201d He compliments, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep training for a while, getting more and more agile as you practice this bodyslam move on various rocks, trees, and of course, the raichu. Soon, you don\u2019t even bounce off his belly anymore! \u201cAlright, I think you\u2019ve just about mastered it,\u201d he smiled, patting you on the head. \u201cCongrats! You\u2019ve officially learned the move Tackle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, not realizing that that very simple move apparently had a name. \u201cTackle?\u201d You raise a brow.  \u201cUh\u2026 how many of these \u2018moves\u2019 are there, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, probably, like, thousands! Here, check this one out!\u201d He smiled, turning to a nearby tree\u2026 before, to your surprise, his cheeks start to glow with static! You jump, startled, as a burst of electricity suddenly flows from his cheeks right at the tree, burning off some of its bark with thunderous power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA!\u201d You gasp, your eyes wide at the sheer show of power! It was like something out of star wars or something\u2026! \u201cYou just\u2026 shot lightning\u2026 from your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! That one\u2019s Thunder Shock. Cool, right?\u201d He smiled, crossing his arms proudly, seeming to enjoy just how awed you were by that simple move. \u201cIf you keep training, you\u2019ll eventually learn moves that let you breathe fire and stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathe fire\u2026? You could hardly imagine spitting fire like a dragon\u2026 but hey, this is a dream, probably, and all sorts of crazy things happen in dreams. If being a Pokemon means that you can unlock all sorts of crazy powers\u2026 maybe you should savor this while it lasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 are you the only other Pokemon?\u201d You eventually ask him curiously, wondering if there are any other unique monsters like him out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, absolutely not! There\u2019s thousands and thousands of different Pokemon out there!\u201d Andre shook his head, tugging his satchel back over his shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of really friendly ones back at the town I come from, Juniper Town. If you want, I can offer you a place to stay for awhile while you get your bearings\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

And he certainly seemed like the friendly sort. You really did need someone to help you figure out this crazy new world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2026 suppose I don\u2019t really have anywhere else to go\u2026\u201d You eventually nod your head, much to his satisfaction. It was pretty much your only option, after all, and to be honest, you wanted to learn a little more about Andre, despite the fact that he might just be a character of a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, cool! I haven\u2019t really had guests over in a while, so my house might be a little messy,\u201d he smiled, excitedly standing up, that tail flicking behind him. \u201cBut hey, I think it\u2019s a cozy enough little place~ C\u2019mon!\u201d With that, he turned around and head into the wilderness, with you trailing slowly behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect, but when you finally emerged onto the streets of Juniper Town, you could only be stunned by what you saw! All around you\u2026 were monsters of all shapes and sizes, every sort of critter you could imagine, all setting up shops, eating at cafes, chatting and coexisting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d You said, glancing all around. It seemed like every time you turned your head, you\u2019d lay eyes on a new and fascinating creature. \u201cThat\u2019s a\u2026 lot of Pokemon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm! It\u2019s the biggest town in the area! All kinds of friendly faces around here\u2026 and some less-than-friendly ones\u2026 but you don\u2019t gotta worry about those!\u201d He smiled, before stopping before one small, simple wooden home, identical to many of the others. \u201cAnd heeere we are! My humble little home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unlocked it with a simple little key from his satchel, and you finally got to peer in. Definitely didn\u2019t look as comfortable as human homes\u2026 a bed that was just a pile of some wooly fluff, a fireplace, a table\u2026 it seemed to lack most of the amenities of modern life. These Pokemon were a simple sort. \u201cWell\u2026 you were right. It does look cozy enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for noticing!\u201d He giggled, before walking over to the dining area, such as it is. \u201cNow, I was just about to eat when I saw you landing. I think I\u2019ll reward myself for that daring rescue with a nice, filling lunch\u2026 care for some yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I could use a bite to eat\u2026\u201d You nod. You watch him take a bunch of berries from his satchel, and use them to cook a big, delicious-smelling strew on the fireplace. It looked like a huge meal! You had no idea how the two of you were going to eat it all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spilled half of the stew into your bowl, and half into his\u2026 but it still looked like a massive meal! The bowl was almost as big as your entire body! You look down at it, stunned\u2026 but when you look up, he was already chugging his bowl down with apparent ease, bulge after bulge sliding down his throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in sheer awe, your eyes widening. He wasn\u2019t really going to\u2026 finish the whole thing in one gulp, was he? But sure enough, he took a bowl as big as you entire body\u2026 and gulped down the entire stew in just a single, long slurp! Only to let out a relaxed sigh when he plopped the now empty bowl back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You haven\u2019t even touched your\u2019s yet!\u201d You stare down in awe at this belly, which was now even bigger than before! In fact, it was absolutely huge! He looked stuffed to the limit, with his belly bouncing and sloshing with even movement, churning and squishing as it was pressed against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how he could act so casual, when he looked stuffed to the absolute limit! \u201cWha- buh\u2026\u201d You stuttered, stunned. \u201cYou\u2026 you just emptied that whole bowl in one gulp! H-how\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hehe!\u201d He smiled, reaching down and kneading that big, fluffy, squishy tummy of his with a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly even a big meal! It was really just a light lunch. Stomachs are super flexible, you know! Mine isn\u2019t even halfway full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were mesmerized by the sight of it slosh and jiggle. \u201cCan I\u2026 touch it\u2026?\u201d You asked absent-mindedly, only to blush when you realize what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure!\u201d He smiled widely, moving forward and pushing his belly out for you to enjoy. You hesitated, but\u2026 you couldn\u2019t help but bring up your forepaws, and start to rub and knead that huge, gurgling tum. It was\u2026 so\u2026 soft\u2026 so squishy\u2026 so fluffy\u2026 you could hardly believe it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were pressing your cheek up against it, resting your ear against it just to listen to it slosh and churn as it squeezes around the shifting contents packed away within. \u201cHehe\u2026 I\u2019m flattered you like my tummy so much, but your stew is getting cold!\u201d He smiled. \u201cGo on, chow down! Trust me, you\u2019ll love it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, you take a seat on one of the simple wooden chairs, leaning forward to take a sip of his homemade stew\u2026 only for it to taste absolutely delightful! You just have to keep going, slurping up the delicious berry stew at a faster and faster rate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as you ate, you could feel your stomach start to\u2026 swell. You could feel your meal start to push at the walls of your stomach as you filled yourself up, but inside of being painful, it just felt\u2026 good. Almost like you just wanted to stretch your stomach out as big as possible\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost in a hypnotic trance until, at last, you were disappointed when you realized you\u2019d drank all the stew. But then you looked down\u2026 and noticed your own belly was absolutely enormous! You reached down, poking and prodding at it as you could feel every little bit of the stew slosh and shift around inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a giggle, the raichu moved forward\u2026 and pressed his own, similarly sized tummy against yours! You let out a light gasp as both of the big, sloshy, gurgly bellies were squished together, sloshing around their contents as you were treated to the sound of two cute, powerful stomachs gurgling and digesting. \u201cSee? I told you so!\u201d He giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next while together, feeling eachother\u2019s tummies and talking about all the lovely cuisine native to this region. You had no idea you\u2019d ever like this sort of thing, but feeling your own tummy swell and slosh with food, and being able to rub and massage the cute pikachu\u2019s similarly round belly\u2026 it was just super fun and cozy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn\u2019t just sit around doing that all day. Before you knew it, your belly had shrunk to the point that you could move easily again, and you and Andre had to contemplate what to do next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be staying here\u2026 I should get used to the town, right?\u201d You tilt your head, figuring that you might as well start with the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you want me to give you a tour? Well, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d He smiles, proudly laying a paw on his chest. \u201cGiving tours is one of my many specialties! I assure you, you\u2019ll know this whole town like the back of your paw in no time~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you were out the door! You blushed a bit, finding it embarrassing to be walking around with such an engorged belly swaying beneath you, but looking around, you noticed a lot of Pokemon around here seemed similarly full. Guess it must be around lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend most of your time asking about the Pokemon you see, trying to mesmerize the names Andre tells you so you can remember all the species and types there are out there. You were really impressed by the all the imagination that went into these \u2018Pokemon\u2019 things. Eventually, you and Andre stop by a small, odd-looking circus tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat over there is the Travelling Circus. It\u2019s stopped in Juniper Town for a while, and it sells all of the best goods! It\u2019s where I\u2019ve been doing all my grocery shopping recently.\u201d He says, which confused you somewhat. How can it be both a circus, and a grocery store? Or maybe it\u2019s just a grocery store themed after a circus\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are two places in town you can\u2019t go to. The first is that big, fancy ship over there. That\u2019s the Exploration Guild!\u201d He says, pointing to a HUGE ship anchored at the docks of the town, with a strange symbol and its sails. \u201cThey hunt outlaws, rescue missing Pokemon, explore mystery dungeons\u2026 they\u2019re, like, the coolest gang of adventurers ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026 they do sound pretty cool.\u201d You ponder it. You feel like you could get up to some of your own adventures, yourself... \u201cWhat\u2019s the other place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, the other place is that noble district over there.\u201d He smiles, pointing to an area up on a hill, that seems completely walled-off and opulent. \u201cThat\u2019s where all the richest and most influential Pokemon around here hang out. You can\u2019t go in unless you have an invitation. They like to keep all the riff raff out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you lay eyes on something interesting. There was a haxorus there, a mountain of sharp metal, but his underside seemed to be comparatively smooth and soft. And, sure enough, his belly was poking out, distending wider than any you\u2019ve seen so far\u2026 and it was moving and bulging like crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! What did that Pokemon eat?\u201d Your eyes widened as you started it, wondering just what on earth you could eat around here that could make your belly wriggle like it had a mind of its own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Andre turned to look, only to chuckle a bit. \u201cOh? Probably another Pokemon. Looks like a real wriggler, too,\u201d he chuckled nonchalantly, patting his own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you were stunned! \u201cThey\u2026 they swallowed somebody?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah! Don\u2019t feel too bad for them, though. Leading your whole life just to become part of another Pokemon\u2019s body\u2026 it\u2019s the most noble way to go!\u201d He said, just continuing to walk, acting like this whole thing was no big deal. Apparently this whole Pokemon world had a dark side\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hardly get your head around what you were seeing! You were just mesmerized by the look of the haxorus\u2019 huge, bulging gut, knowing there\u2019s actually another Pokemon alive and squirming in there. Guess there\u2019s really nothing to be afraid of, if this is really all just a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey! Look over there! One of those famous Juniper Town eating contests is about to start! I\u2019ve got to check it out! Wanna come with?\u201d Andre smiles, pointing to a nearby stage\u2026 but you hesitate on what you really want to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You shiver, trying to push the haxorus out of your mind. There\u2019s no point in associating with Pokemon like that\u2026 especially since it seems that he has plenty of room for more! \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be right there, Andre!\u201d You nod, chasing along after him as he makes his way to the town plaza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plaza seems to be fairly full, with tons of Pokemon around to watch all the contests onstage. It was a little awkward squeezing past all that fluff and fur, but eventually, you and Andre find spots to sit just in time for to catch the next show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the left, we have the famous professional food taster, Nicholas!\u201d The announcer declared. Sure enough, the feraligatr on the left looked like what you\u2019d imagine a food taster would look like. You had to admit, he was pretty cute, what with that huge, round belly of his, especially as the obese gator laughs and shows it off to the adoring crowd. Some of his fangirls in the front are squealing with glee, and you\u2019re almost tempted to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd on the right, we have his opponent\u2026 the leader of the Juniper Town gym, Rafael!\u201d On the other side was a similar-sized charizard, who was quite muscular aside from his big, round, but still quite firm belly. They were both absolutely massive, and you couldn\u2019t help but swoon a little at the side of them! This was going to be quite a show!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis match\u2019s victor shall be\u2026 the first to down 100 poffins!\u201d Sure enough, the covers of the massive trays in front of the two men were removed, revealing massive piles of delicious poffins! You were in awe, concerned about whether they\u2019d even be able to fit it all, but they just licked their lips, seemingly unafraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we ready, folks? Say it with me, now\u2026 3, 2, 1, EAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they were off! You\u2019d never seen anything like it! Those two massive jaws just descended\u2026 and almost a half dozen of those big soft poffins disappeared into their powerful maws in a single instant! If you\u2019d have blinked, you\u2019d have completely missed just how fast they had gobbled them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them go, you could tell why they were so fearless! These two were pure eating machines, to the point that it made your own slightly engorged belly look slightly paltry in comparison.They almost seemed to be moved in unison, swallowing their meals down with almost robotic efficiency, big chunks of the mountains of food in front of them disappearing in mere moments!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies just kept growing and growing, constricting powerfully around their meals to convert the poffins within them into a round, compact mass of dough. The way they moved their jaws, their throats, their bellies, it was almost an artform! Everything perfectly attuned to eat as much as possible, as quickly as possible\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost holding your breath as they were down to the last two dozen pastries, keeping a careful eye on every bite to see which one would emerge the victor\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the winner is\u2026 RAFAEL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the charizard managed to take the last big bite just mere moments before the feraligatr would manage it. The big dragon would rear back with a smug grin on his face, letting out a loud, thunderous belch as he rubbed his belly, amidst the cheering of his adoring crowd! His belly was unbelievably huge, and yet he moved with ease\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Nicholas seemed like a good sport. He turned and shook hands with the charizard, congratulating him on his victory, even kneading and massaging the charizard\u2019s tummy for a moment as a show of good faith. With that, the feraligatr marched from the stage, leaving only the charizard, sitting in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your confusion, a whole other tray was brought out before the charizard. Was he really going to eat even more, after all that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for our victor, this rounds reward is\u2026 a Delcatty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charizard licked his lips as the tray was uncovered, to reveal an eager-looking delcatty smiling up at him. Meanwhile, you were in complete shock! He wasn\u2019t able to just eat her, right on stage, right? What kind of crazy contest is this, where people are offered up as prizes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was just as you feared\u2026 the charizard was quickly lifting him up to her maw, her tongue gliding against her chin as the crowd swooned. You know you should look away, but you just can\u2019t! The vision of the feline slipping deeper into the dragon\u2019s warm, wet, powerful maw was just too mesmerizing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how the delcatty could be so willing, knowing she was about to be devoured! But on the other hand, some strange part of you was a tiny bit envious. He did seem to be so very gentle, savoring his meal slowly and delicately, making sure to glide his tongue over inch of the delicious feline\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bit as he seemed to pay particular attention to running his tongue over her thick rump, apparently finding the plumpness back there particularly squishy and tasty. But eventually, that too disappeared down his gullet, and eventually, the feline was completely sealed away in Rafael\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a daze, realizing you\u2019d just witnessed a Pokemon\u2019s last moment of seeing the outside world, before being doomed to the fate of food! But everybody just seemed so casual about it, even cheering for him as he let out one last huge belch, shaking his belly up and down and showing it off to the crowd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty awesome show, right?\u201d Andre happily elbowed you gently in the side as the charizard stood up and walked offstage, the delcatty\u2019s body completely invisible beneath that pudge. She had been forgotten about completely, it seemed, just serving as the dragon\u2019s food to make his gluttonous body even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the announcer, a chatot, finally flew onstage. \u201cAlright, folks! That wraps up this afternoon\u2019s last pro match!\u201d He announced. \u201cWe shall be beginning the more casual matches in a moment! If you\u2019d like to participate in an eating contest, raise your paw now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre elbowed you in the side gently again. \u201cHey! You know what? We should totally try a match!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the thought of going out there in front of all those Pokemon, and potentially embarrassing yourself. Still, your mind was still completely dedicated to the match you just witnessed\u2026 \u201cI dunno\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mooon, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Come on up, newbie! Show everybody what you\u2019re capable of!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were nervous as can be as you trotted up onto the stage alongside Andre, taking your places at the same seats the previous two contestants had. Watching the stage from the crowd was one thing, but actually being on the stage felt completely different! You were shaking a bit, knowing that all eyes on were on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whispered your names to the chatot, and he cleared his throat as he opted to get this show on the road. \u201cAlright! Here on our left, we have an old contestant, Andre\u2026!\u201d He got some cheers, as it seems Pokemon around here knew him, and in response, he happily showed off his own belly, using it as a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd on the left, we have our newbie, uhh\u2026 Kristina! Let\u2019s all give her a warm welcome!\u201d You blush a bit as everyone claps for you, all seeming rather interested in seeing what you can do. Well, at least it seemed like a nice crowd\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the winner shall be\u2026\u201d Your eyes widened as two big trays were plopped down in front of the both of you, your mind racing with possibilities, until finally the lids were taken off to reveal\u2026 \u201cwhoever\u2019s first to eat 30 hot dogs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at the huge amount of freshly cooked hot dogs before you. You\u2019d mostly digested your previous meal, but still, you don\u2019t even know if you can fit all this food in your belly! \u201cHey, don\u2019t be nervous! I\u2019ll go easy on ya!\u201d Andre smiled, trying to calm your nerves, only succeeding somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay it with me, folks...! 3, 2, 1, EAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was no backing out now! You tried to ignore the eyes of the endless crowd, and instead focus on the meal in front of you. You immediately tried to shove as many hot dogs into your mouth as possible, until your cheeks were bloated out almost like a squirrel\u2026 only to wince a bit as you have to chew down to soften the chunk of meat in your mouth, swallowing it bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over and see that Andre was taking a more cautious approach, shoving three or four hot dogs into his mouth at a time and swallowing them whole. You decide to follow his example, bulge after bulge sliding down your throat as you gulp down the meat as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long until you were starting to feel the burn, as it were. Once you were halfway through the hot dogs, your belly was already bulging out as big and round as it was after that stew, and you already felt full and engorged. How were you going to make it through the other half\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly groaned and glurped, squished underneath you as it got rounder and rounder, as you could only do your best to keep filtering hot dogs down your throat, feeling each of them land in your stomach and shift around with the meat already tightly packed in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the pikachu\u2019s belly was expanding to similar sizes, but yet, he seemed much more accustomed to it. It hardly slow him down, rubbing his own gurgling belly with a paw while shoveling chunks of hot dog down his gullet with another hand, practically cooing at the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to keep up! You wanted to prove yourself in front of the entire town, in the hopes of making a good first impression. Win or lose, you have to give it your all! A look of dedication dawns on your face as you lift the tray up with your paws, and start to just let the hot dogs all slide down your throat at once, trying to choke them all down...</span></div></div>",

While you were obviously overburdened by just how stuffed you were, he seemed like an expert, casually running a hand over his absolutely engorged gut while picking at his teeth with a toothpick. \u201cAh~! My compliments to the chef!\u201d He declares, proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole crowd claps for him, while you just look down at your huge belly. This was going to make walking difficult for a while. You sigh as you poke and prod it, thinking that, if you\u2019d have known Andre was going to win, you wouldn\u2019t have stuffed yourself this bad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Andre strut around the stage a bit, lifting his belly up and letting it bounce and slosh in front of the crowd, who were all cheering openly for him. You weren\u2019t upset that you lost or anything\u2026 and it was nice to be able to see Andre so happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake his paw, before starting to very slowly waddle offstage, your gut dragging along the crowd as you moved back towards the audience. However, he stayed onstage\u2026 and your heart skipped a beat when you saw another tray get brought out for him! You knew what that meant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd for our victor, this rounds reward is\u2026 a Buneary!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your very eyes, the lid was removed, revealing a little rabbit sitting there, looking happily up at the hungry chu. You could only watch, wide-eyed, as he licked his lips at the sight of her, eventually causing the bunny to giggle as that tongue travelled over her cheeks and belly, tasting her like she was nothing but a meal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching that charizard eat somebody had been awe-inspiring enough\u2026 but watching your new friend treat somebody like a snack? You didn\u2019t quite know what to feel! All you knew is that you couldn\u2019t look away, your cheeks burning red as he moved down to lick at her small paws, before finally sliding them into his maw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed openly, a dopey expression on her face as she rubbed the back of his head, as he started to feed her into his jaws feet-first, coated her in that warm saliva. You were starting to shiver a bit, seeing just how willing she was to slide right down that powerful throat, and become his simple meal\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torso slipped in easily, and soon, only her head poked out of his maw. She was blushy as can be, and looked around, getting the last view of sunlight she\u2019d ever get\u2026 before she was dragged down into darkness with another gulp, a bulge sliding down Andre\u2019s throat until that, too, disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in absolute awe! Even after having already stuffed himself that much, he still had room to swallow somebody whole with ease\u2026 and she didn\u2019t even end up making a bulge, instead just ending up tightly packed with the food already in there. That\u2019s what she was\u2026 just food, just like all the hot dogs he\u2019d eaten. He didn\u2019t care about who she was, he just cared about how she gurgled away in his belly into yet more softness. Your heart fluttered at the thought of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a big, thunderous belch as he finally finished his meal, wriggling and squishing his belly for a while onstage, showing off just how easily he\u2019d downed the\u2026 what was it again? Some kind of rabbit? Nobody even remembered\u2026 but it didn\u2019t matter now. She was just a snack, ultimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheered as Andre walked offstage, and led you away from the whole contest. He let out another belch as he walked alongside you, rubbing his belly with his paws. \u201cUrrrrp! Man, that was a great match! You did really good, I\u2019m impressed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, all you could do was stare at his belly, trying to see any sign of the buneary inside\u2026 but you couldn\u2019t. If you hadn\u2019t seen her get swallowed with your own eyes, you\u2019d have no idea she was in there. \u201cYou\u2026 you just\u2026 swallowed somebody\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles, lifting his belly up and dropping it, just to let it bounce and jiggle somewhat, presumably sloshing the girl within around. \u201cYup! She was absolutely delicious! The perfect dessert after a big meal~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you just remained silent, wide-eyed as you stared at his belly, not even knowing what to say. \u201c... is something wrong?\u201d Andre asked, raising a brow. \u201cYou know she was a volunteer, right? She wanted to get eaten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know\u2026 but\u2026\u201d You shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s still\u2026 crazy! Like\u2026 is there even any air in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah! There\u2019s plenty enough air. It\u2019s probably really dark and cramped, though,\u201d he confessed, squishing his tummy with a paw. \u201cShe\u2019s still moving around in there. You can feel my belly, if you want to feel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed wildly as he stopped, holding out his belly to you. Still, you couldn\u2019t resist resting a paw against it, squishing down into that incredible softness\u2026 only to feel movement, hidden deep within. Your whole body shivered at the sensation. \u201cW-whoa\u2026 she\u2026 she really is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could use a nice tummy rub to help her settle down, you know\u2026\u201d He smiled mischievously, seeing just how blushy you were. You somehow grew even more red, but still, you couldn\u2019t help but bring your paws to his belly, and start kneading and massaging at that sensitive skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you pressed your ear against it, listening to the sounds of gurgling and churning within that soft belly. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to\u2026 digest her\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I mean. Yeah!\u201d He shrugged, casually. \u201cI know you might be new to this whole thing, but really, there\u2019s nothing better than gurglin\u2019 a Pokemon up into a nice, soft new layer of pudge~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered again at just how casually he was talking about this, as if other people were meals to him. \u201cW-would you even eat\u2026 m-me?\u201d You eventually couldn\u2019t help but asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, leaning forward and licking his lips. \u201cWell\u2026 I did think you were pretty tasty when I first met you!\u201d He confessed. \u201cI\u2019d never eat you without permission\u2026 but if you ever feel like becomin\u2019 some of my pudge, I\u2019d be more than happy to oblige!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYipe!\u201d At this point, you were blushing so hard you had to lean back and cover your face with your paws, embarrassed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe! Hey, it\u2019s just an offer!\u201d He giggled, wrapping an arm around your shoulder, leaning your head against his soft, squishy, fluffy gut. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine with you being my friend, instead of my snack! It\u2019s all up to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026 you had to stop thinking about this! This conversation was going to places you didn\u2019t want it to go. You pull away, shaking your head, trying to reorient yourself. \u201cI-I think we should just rest!\u201d You say. \u201cFind somewhere to digest all this\u2026 with all these hot dogs, I can barely move\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where to go?</span></div></div>",

Stick close to me, I'll lead the way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you began your walk back to Andre's house. All the way, you leaned on Andre for support, the heavy meal in your belly weighing you down a lot. But Andre seemed to be used to having such a full belly, as he wasn't slowed by it at all. In about 30 minutes however, you had arrived at Andre's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was relatively plain, just like you remembered. Nothing seemed to have changed in the few hours you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre gestured to the bed. \"Why don't you just take my bed for now? I'll make myself a second one to sleep on, it shouldn't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You replied, feeling too tired to argue. You lied down in bed, and quickly fell asleep to the gurgling of your own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to some loud snoring. Andre had made a second bed next to yours, and was sleeping soundly in it, snoring very loudly. Feeling a bit thirsty, you decided to get out of bed to get some water. After getting up, you took a quick look at yourself. You had mostly finished digesting your dinner, and had gained quite a few pounds as a result. You waddled your newly padded body over to the jar of water that Andre kept in his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you took your drink, you couldn't help but remember the events from the eating contest. The memory played over and over again in your mind, seeing that buneary slide down your new friend's throat, into his hungry stomach. You couldn't help but imagine what it was like for her... packed into his already stuffed stomach with the rest of his meal. The walls holding her tight, hugging her until she finally fell asleep... And by now, she was nothing but Pikachu pudge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished your drink of water, you felt refreshed. And you had made up your mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that, in the morning you would...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you were looking yourself over, you realized that you <i>liked</i> all of the weight you had gained from your massive meal. But one look at Andre told you that he had gained far more than you did, despite eating about the same amount of hot dogs. He had simply done it faster. You then realized that the reason he had gained so much more than you, was because of the Buneary! To think one little Pokemon could make such a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your conscience still told you that this was a bad idea. A Pokemon that got eaten didn't come back after all. So you made a compromise with yourself, and decided that you would only do it if the other Pokemon was willing. That way you would be doing them a favor... or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you returned to your bed, your mouth already beginning to drool. Just thinking about it was making you hungry. You drifted off to sleep, dreaming of the delicious Pokemon you would find tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke in the morning to the sounds of Andre moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepyhead!

Hey, it's almost noon, and I'm getting pretty hungry. You want to go find something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to his question, your stomach growled loudly. \"Hehe, yeah. Actually, I wanted to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you curiously. \"Yeah, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke eye contact with him and blushed. It felt embarrassing to ask, but you finally managed to say \"I was wondering if there was a way to find willing meals? I'm... actually really curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you want to try being a predator huh?\" He put a paw to his chin. \"Willing meals... lemme think...\" </span></div></div>",

Based on the lack of activity on the streets the two of you must have woken up fairly early, the morning sun feeling warm on your fur. Walking through the village you passed some of the locations Andre showed you the day before until you came to a plaza that had streets stretching off to different parts of the small town. You kept following him until he came to a stop before a large wooden board plastered with notes and letters. \"I didn't end up showing you this yesterday but this is the village's main bulletin board. People usually post announcements or requests for help but every now and then you can find someone advertising <i>themselves</i> instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do? They really just put up a note and let whatever stranger that sees it come and eat them?\" you asked in disbelief. The concept that people enjoyed getting eaten in this world was still strange to you and it was even stranger to learn that they post up notices to get someone to devour them. You started getting anxious as you realized that in this case the one answering the advertisement would be you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Those types of posts tend to get taken pretty quickly so there's a chance we might not find anything. Let's have a look though!\" Andre said. With that, the both of you were scanning the board and just like he said there were requests for assistance; <i>lots</i> of them.. There were posts about missing Pokemon or bounties for rampaging outlaws to more simpler things like a request for a specific type of berry. Your eyes skimmed from paper to paper as you tried to find the right one and you noticed somewhere along the way that the town was starting to wake up. The sound of Pokemon talking filled the plaza as they all started their daily routines and made their way to wherever they had to be. Having scanned through half the board with no success you were starting to get skeptical, especially when the other odd Pokemon joined in and occasionally took one of the many pieces of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there!\" Andre exclaimed. With a jump the Pikachu snatched the notice from the board and read through it, walking a short distance away from the small crowd forming at the bulletin board. You eagerly awaited his verdict as his eyes scanned from line to line until he eventually let out a chuckle. \"Well, we found one,\" he said while turning the letter to you. You quickly learned why Andre chuckled when you read that the author of the note was a Vulpix, just like you. He stated that he was a male and that he wanted a relatively small Pokemon to eat him, citing Pokemon like Espeon or Umbreon as an example. The rest of the note made you blush as it went into great detail on how he wants to be tightly squished inside a stomach before it abruptly ends with a short 'thank you'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Andre asked. \"For a first-timer it might be a tad difficult but I think you'll do alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe?\" You replied, eyes glossing over the note again. The fact it was another Vulpix made you hesitant. Considering the culture of this strange world you guessed that cannibalism was a concept they're not too worried about but that wasn't why you were uncertain. Being one yourself you knew that he would be roughly the same size as you and while you fit the 'small Pokemon' category he wanted you were skeptical if you could even get him down. If you went through with it you would literally be eating your entire body weight in a single bite! Then again, Andre seemed confident that you could do it and you <i>did</i> see him eat a Buneary that was roughly his own size so maybe it was possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay or nay? We could always go and try to find a smaller Pokemon if you're not up to it. There are a few Pokemon I know that might be interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the two of you walked you noticed that all the small houses and buildings were becoming more and more spread out, the treeline of a nearby forest coming into view. A few moments later after getting closer to woodlands Andre suddenly began veering off into the forest. Considering he knows this town you followed him without a word, assuming that it must be where the Vulpix was. Most of the vegetation in the area was brown and orange as if it was Autumn, dry leaves crunching under your paws as he lead you further to a small clearing. Either this world had seasons like your world or this place was exceptionally dry, either way the area had a beauty about it as leaves intermittently floated down to the ground around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre stopped and turned to you with an enthusiastic smile. \"Hey, wait here for a minute and I'll go grab him, his place isn't too far from here. I'll tell him where you are and that you're waiting for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you're not going to stay with me?\" you asked, slightly worried. \"What if something happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your first time!\" he exclaimed. \"The first one's always special so I thought i'd leave you two alone. If anything happens I'll hear it from nearby but I think you'll do fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, the only advice I can give you is to <i>use gravity</i>. Just wait right here,\" he said. Andre suddenly turned and went back the way you came and soon he disappeared behind the trees. Now alone, your heart was nearly beating out of your chest and you decided to plant your haunches on the ground as you waited. You couldn't help but shift and shuffle as you sat, the nervousness you were feeling was intense as if you were waiting for a date that may or may not show. You really didn't want to mess up; Andre made it look easy but you were really not sure how it would go down and the fact that you would be doing it without his guidance made you even more unsure. Shaking your head you tried to think of the assuring words he left you with and his confidence that you would do fine alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later the sound of crunching leaves caught your attention and you turned to see the Pokemon that you would be eating, his eyes nervously darting side to side as he slowly approached. Everything from his rusty-red fur to his six tales looked exactly like yours, the only difference between the two of you being the parts sitting between your hind legs. When he approached closed enough he sat down with you and from the way his chest was rapidly rising up and down as he breathed you assumed he must be as anxious as you were. \"Um, hello,\" he timidly greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he was equally as nervous made you feel a bit better. Offering a smile you greeted him,\"hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the Pokemon that's, uh-\" he trailed off for a moment as he looked to the side, a blush clearly visible through his red fur. \"-Going to eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah,\" you mumbled while giving an embarrassed smile. The two of you sat in silence for a moment as you both eyed each other until he gained the courage to speak up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty,\" he said before he quick became flustered. \"Er, what I mean is that I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" you said, a blush covering your face. You remembered what the two of you were really here for so you try and steer the conversation in the right direction. \"Okay, this is my first time, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" the Vulpix boy blurted out with a smile. \"That's great! I was told that predators always remember their first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so?\" you chuckle. The word 'predator' stood out to you as you realized that in this scenario, you definitely were just that. \"Are you sure about this, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, I've been thinking about this a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if your sure. How do you think we should start? you asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, maybe my paws first?\" he said as he lifted up his arms. Cupping your own paws under his you could feel his weight and you stayed like that for a moment as you psyched yourself up. After all, it was new territory for the both of you, though, when you thought about it he wouldn't be able to experience this again. Looking at him all you could think about was how this Vulpix in front of you would be ultimately be digested and become the fat and muscle on your body. The thought left you sad for a moment; if things were different this Vulpix could very well have became one of your friends but in one strange way, won't he be with you forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word you brought his paws up to your open mouth and slowly slid them in, noting that they had a salty, earthy taste to them. The Vulpix boy gave an anxious chuckle as he peered into your maw and exhaled sharply as he felt his paws hit the back of your throat. With a gulp, more of his arms disappeared down your throat and  you were surprised to see the him get pulled closer toward you. Swallowing again, he was pulled nearer and now he was close enough that his face was right in front of yours. You could feel his hot, excited breath as he let out his final words. \"It would be cool if you grew up and evolved into a Ninetales. I'd love to be a part of that.\" he said, surprisingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mouth full you looked into his eyes and nodded. Having only spent a few short moments with him you felt that the two of you had already reached the pinnacle of relationship with how intimate the act you were committing was; after all, how closer could one be? You wasted no time in pulling more of his arms into your mouth and with a big gasp, you pulled your jaws over his short muzzle. Your throat bulged as you pushed more of your maw over his face while the Vulpix boy did his own part and pushed onto you. Soon, his ears folded and you were up to his neck. His shoulders proved more of a challenge and you had to really force yourself down onto them but they managed to fill your throat too. While the surprising flexibility of your throat and jaw filled you with confidence, you were a little worried about the fact the Vulpix was uncomfortably blocking your airways. Bit by bit you swallowed hard, feeling more of his furry body disappear within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your jaws finally passed his belly and reached his hinds legs you were able to lift him up, and just as Andre suggested, you used gravity to help you swallow your prey down by heaving him upwards. As the bulk of his hips passed your throat you were shocked at how he suddenly started sliding down, all six tails snaking down your maw. After a final swallow you gasped for fresh air as he cleared your esophagus and snugly eased his entire form into your stomach, adrenaline coursing through your system as your mind took a moment to comprehended what just happened. <i>You just ate a Pokemon!</i> Pressing your paws down on your massively distended belly you could feel the slight form of him just under your flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your throat and chest ached intensely the satisfaction of being full outweighed the pain, it made you feel powerful and the fact that he offered himself willingly made you feel even more contented. Collapsing on your back you couldn't get enough of tracing your paws along the contours he made on your belly, knowing full well that later on every part of his body from his head to his tails would be broken down and redistributed around your own. From the dull pleasured moaning that was making your insides vibrate, you were sure that he was enjoying it on his end, too. You sat in leaves for a while with the weight of your prey sitting on top of you, giggling at the sensations of the Vulpix squirming around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so wrapped up in the Pokemon in your gut you failed to notice that another one had approached you. Tossing over on your side you could see that it was your Pikachu friend, Andre. \"I see it all went well,\" he said. \"So how does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little sore but it feels great! I can't believe it but I could probably get used to this,\" you replied while stretching out. Sneaking a look you could see that Andre must have picked up something to eat along the way, too, although it paled in comparison to how large your belly was right now. You doubt you could even walk like this and the wave of lethargy washing over you wasn't helping either. Perhaps an early morning nap was in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, want a belly rub?\" Andre slyly suggested. \"Or is that some post-meal tiredness I see in your eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, the feeling of a full belly was making you pretty tired right now but you think that a belly rub might just be the thing to wake you up. Either way, from how Andre was acting you don't think he minds. What do you want to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tried sleeping at first, but between Andre's snoring, and your excitement over what was to come, you found you couldn't. Eventually, you decided to try and sleep up against Andre's belly. You gave it a gentle rub, and Andre murmured in his sleep, but didn't wake up. His belly felt warm and soft to the touch, and you couldn't feel the buneary at all anymore. In just a few short hours, his stomach had reduced his willing meal into little more than pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And soon he'll do the same to me...</i> You thought to yourself, with a strange sense of happiness. With those thoughts in your head, you fell asleep, free to dream about what it was going to be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you awoke along with Andre, who seemed happy to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you wanted to sleep together you could have just asked.\" He chuckled, and then smiled at you. \"Bet it was because you couldn't resist my belly.\" He added, patting his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yeah...\" You blushed in response to his teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Andre's stomach growled loudly. \"Oops, guess my meal didn't last as long as I thought it would. Want to go get breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, about that...\" Your blush intensified as you tried to come up with a good way to ask him. \"I was thinking, maybe you could have um... me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? R-really?\" Andre seemed very surprised. \"Are-are you sure? You just learned about all this last night! There's no coming back once you uh... take the plunge.\" He looked at you very seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't think you could blush any harder, and yet, your cheeks got even redder than they already were. \"Y-yeah. I spent all night thinking about that buneary, and what it must have been like for her. Warm and cozy, you just fall asleep, and then become a part of something greater. I-I have no idea why, but that sounds... amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are serious about this, huh?\" He looked at you sadly, but he quickly discarded it for <i>hunger...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want, I'd be happy to become your new home.\" And with that, Andre grabbed you, and hugged you tightly against his belly. He then brought your face up to his, and gave you an experimental lick. \"Spicy. just like I thought.\" He observed. His hunger wouldn't wait however, and he began to open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre opened his mouth wider and wider, until it completely engulfed your vision, and then he gently bit down. Your entire world was plunged into a warm, wet darkness, and you felt his tongue lapping over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh...\" You heard Andre's murrs of pleasure echo around you. Apparently you were really tasty. But he didn't linger long before pushing your face back further in his mouth. And then, with a resounding <i>Gulp!</i> you began your descent into Andre's hungry stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith repeated swallows, Andre pulled you deeper and deeper, his tongue licking over every inch of your body along the way. It wasn't long before he reached your rump, and pulled it and your hind paws into his mouth, leaving only your tails sticking out of his mouth. It was only a second before he slurped them up as well, completely sealing you inside him. After a moment you finally made it all the way down his throat, and ended up in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Buuuuurp!</b> The once spacious stomach hugged you tightly, since Andre had just let all the air out. \"Wow... you were the tastiest pokemon I've ever eaten!\" You heard him say, muffled on the other side of the stomach wall. You felt him reach out with a paw and begin to gently rub you. \"How are you liking it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing... It's so warm in here...\" You returned his rubs from the outside with your own internal massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, but uh... I may not have been completely truthful. I could let you back out right now, but I'm really hungry, so I don't think I will be able to hold back for long... You sure you want to stay forever?\" You could hear a hint of worry in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It is amazing in here,</i> you thought to yourself. <i>But do I really want to become Andre's fat?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems It's time to make up your mind.

Maybe it was just because of you? He had already laid down to rest before you were even able to struggle from the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe promised to let you out if you wanted! Why was he doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the Pikachu was enjoying this maybe a little too much. He had eaten many pokemon before you, but your amazing taste had left him mesmerized. You filled his belly so nicely and his stomach simply <i>begged</i> him to keep you there. To make you one with him, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly began to realize what had you gotten into - you were going to be made into <i>food</i>, nutrients, all of you would disappear and become a permanent part of the Pikachu that had eaten you. Being inside a stomach felt amazing, true, but was it really worth giving everything you were for the experience...? Considering this, it was pretty clear that you should just close your eyes and accept your fate. After all, you were sure your friend would take care of you, and whatever is left after the digestion process. Maybe being a part of a pikachu wasn't so bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No</i>. You couldn't accept that, you had fallen for the temptation of doing this, but you knew you were meant to do more in this place. Maybe even eventually go back to the real world. With your newfound determination, you began to struggle even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the stomach was quickly taking a toll on you. The heat was almost hypnotizing even by your fire-type standards, and you were already starting to feel very sleepy, just by being there. Your struggles were becoming ever so weak with every passing minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andre... please... I don't...\" was the last thing you managed to say before you finally closed your eyes. All your body wanted to do was to rest, despite your struggles. However, in your last effort you managed to perform a somewhat good tackle, not that it would do much to the cushioned stomach walls but was still felt by your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, that tackle had woken up Andre from his trance - he had eaten his new friend, and it was clear she wasn't willing to go any further! He quickly checked on you and you were not moving at all, maybe it was too late?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow pokemon considered his promise, and decided he had to act quickly, or lest he would lose a friend. The pikachu quickly stood up and began the somewhat uncomfortable process of regurgitation - not very pleasant but he knew what to do. He began to cough you up, and you were slowly making your way up his throat into the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the mouse pokemon discharged you to the ground with a bunch of stomach fluids - he quickly checked up on you and found you were ok, just sleeping and for what it seemed, very, very exhausted. The pikachu was left rather tired too - and very hungry. He quickly put you up in the bed again and left you to rest for a while, and after checking that you were indeed going to be okay, he had to get some breakfast after all and it would be rather rude to wake you up after such experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, it was pretty clear that you would need to sleep for a while and recover from the whole ordeal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every passing moment in Andre's belly was making you feel more tired. Your body was giving in, no doubt about that. The heat and overall feeling of being trapped in the organic chamber was making you feel extremely tired, despite your newfound will to keep going in this strange new world. Your struggles didn't seem to be working, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour orange fur was completely covered in stomach juices. A rather relaxing sensation but a very worrying one - if the pikachu did not let you out soon, it would be too late. Why wasn't he responding to your shouts? You clearly wanted out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre did hear you pretty clearly about letting you out, but something inside of him stirred. He had eaten plenty of <i>willing</i> pokemon before, but none of them actually wanted to get out and were totally resigned to their fate. He hadn't given the option to get out before either, but he seemed to take a strong liking to you in the short time you just met. There was something about this situation, the sheer power of keeping you there - even against your will, that made him feel so good. His stomach needed you there, to fill it, to make you <i>his</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had taken a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kristina... I don't think I'm going to let you out. I said it could be done but... I simply can't. You were the tastiest pokemon I've ever eaten, and I can't let such a meal go...\" Andre said very calmy, and laid down on his bed again to enjoy your struggles even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he just said left you paralyzed. How could he, after he promised?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?! You said you could let me o...\" you couldn't finish the sentence after the stomach tensed up even more, Andre had let out a big belch that made your flesh prison feel even tighter. To the stomach, it didn't matter that you were a living creature, you were just another piece of food, and it always did the same to whatever comes inside it: melt it, break it down, then pass it to the intestines and filter the useful things you provided. The sensation was a bit... <i>crushing</i>, even in the literal sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... so spicy. I kinda love this flavor...\" he said without a care in the world, as if he just had eaten a bowl of berries instead of a living being. \"I know what I said... but I simply can't let such a tasty piece of meat go... I'll need to have fire types more often...\", he patted his belly and gave your form a rub, then relaxed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single word he said hit you like a brick. A piece of <i>meat</i>? Is that all you were now? The rubbing made you feel even worse, like if you were his property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was really like that. You began to realize what you had done: by eating you, you simply ceased to be an individual being and started to be part of someone else: there was no need for you to be a layer of fat, just by being <i>inside</i> him you had given up your liberty and became someone else. Any passerby would look and see just a Pikachu, not two individual beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were just meat, pokemon food ready to be processed into nutrients and fat for your host. You didn't have a will of your own, you were subject to whatever your new owner wanted, and in this case, since you were in his stomach, it was pretty clear all it wanted of you was to melt you away and become just fat on his hips, padding on his rear and expel out whatever he couldn't put to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to cry. Is this really what you wanted from this? Maybe you were a bit too hasty in asking for him to eat you.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all I am... just... food to you?\" you sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre didn't even reply. He had no reason to, after all, speaking to your stomach was kinda strange. He just began to doze off, totally engorged on his latest meal and impatient to chunrch it into nice, thick layer of fat... and with those thoughts, he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were absolutely exhausted, even though you stopped struggling just to understand your situation. The stomach had taken its toll on you and you weren't even able to move, all your body begged you to do was to rest, and you just closed your eyes and began settling in... at least, you were able to give yourself to someone else. Your sacrifice wouldn't be in vain, you were going to be put to good use after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snoring from your host started again. You concluded he didn't even pay more attention to you, after all, why would he? Did you really care about your food after eating, or you just wanted to take a nap, feeing it \"go away\" and then continue with your life? That was your last thought as your conscience faded away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndre woke up a few hours later. He had an incredible dream about finding the best food in the world an engorging himself with it. He suddenly saw the second bed he had made, and it hit him - he had eaten you and didn't let you out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly checked his belly, but it wasn't as round as it used to be... it was rather mushy, like he had just eaten a bunch of berries. It was pretty clear to him that you were beyond the point of no return. Suddenly, he felt a rather weak movement from his belly, maybe the last of you was still there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, for some reason, you were able to hear and feel a little. You couldn't move at all, but you could still process what Andre said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began talking, not thinking you would be able to hear him, but to himself. \"Kristina... I'm sorry. But I feel that this was what you really wanted. But hey, you're going to be a pikachu now... or a part of one. At least you're going to be always with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, since there wasn't anything he could do at this point, he fell asleep again and so did you. And this time, you didn't wake up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Andre sleep for another 6 hours. After waking up, his belly was back to normal, albeit he felt a little more padding in his belly. The vulpix had joined him for good, now just another layer of fat in his body. He began wondering if that was what she really wanted, but since you were a part of him, he decided that he would carry on for both of them. Even though he felt a bit guilty, this was the cycle of life - and your sacrifice would help him carry on living. Your adventure had come to an end.</i></span></div></div>",

I happen to know somebody who\u2019s just perfect at helping with this sort of thing! She\u2019ll have these taken care of in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to slowly waddle after him, your belly dragging along the ground all the while, panting at just how stuffed you were. In fact, you even get stuck in the doorway to the massage parlor for a while, grunting as you tried to push your tummy through. Luckily, Andre was there to push against your rump, finally sliding you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around the parlor, and find\u2026 well, it looked similarly low-tech and medieval as Andre\u2019s house. Apparently, these Pokemon didn\u2019t have much modern technology. Still, it looked rather beautifully decorated, and upon trotting in, a tall, surprisingly beautiful mienshao smiled at the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good afternoon there, darlings!\u201d She smiles at the sight of customers, especially since she seems to already be familiar with the pikachu. She giggled a bit, seeing the sheer weights the two of you were hauling around in your swollen guts. \u201cI take it you\u2019re here for a tummy massage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet, Asha!\u201d He smiled, and you wait near the corner while he goes up and plops some strange-looking coins on the counter. \u201cTen minutes for me, and ten minutes for my friend here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, of course! Always love to see a new face. Coming right up!\u201d With that, the mienshao happily proceeded into a back room, where there were little tables lined with that same soft pink wooly-stuff your beds were made out of. Andre happily laid on his back on one of the tables, and so, you did the same with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who shall be going first?\u201d The mienshao asked, only for your belly to just then let out a big, long gurgle at the indigestion it was enduring. \u201cOh! I guess there\u2019s our answer!\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit embarrassed about all this, feeling like nothing more than a dog getting a belly rub. But the moment her hands touched your tummy, you realized that this was definitely going to be no ordinary belly rub! You almost gasped at how effortlessly her hands pushed down into that soft squishiness, shiting around the tightly-packed contents in just the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026 oooh\u2026 aaah\u2026\u201d You were letting out the cutest little squeaks and gasps as she smiles and leans over you, sending her hands along your belly in careful, rhythmic movements, squishing it down in just all the right spots to make your tails wag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s ten!\u201d She smiled, suddenly pulling her hands away. Ten minutes, already? It just felt like a few seconds! Still, you looked down at your belly\u2026 and realized that it was much tinier than it had been before! She really had helped you digest all that food at an incredibly rate. \u201cNow for Andre\u2019s turn~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe gentle, Asha. You should know my tummy has a little \u2018guest\u2019 tucked away inside~\u201d Andre smiled, proudly groping his own belly, causing you to blush at how casual he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe! Of course! I\u2019ll make their progression into pudge as smooth and easy as possible\u2026~\u201d Asha grinned back, before leaning over him and started to knead her fingers into his gut just as she had your\u2019s. He was obviously far more used to the feeling, yet she still managed to edge some moans out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch and blush fiercely at the sight of her putting her all into squishing and squeezing that sensitive gut, being gentle yet firm as can be. You didn\u2019t know who to be more jealous of\u2026 her, or that buneary\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, before your very eyes, his stomach was starting to shrink! As if shifting into overdrive. In fact, as the minutes raced by, it seemed to shrink down almost completely, leaving him with just that regular potbelly he had when you first met him. You realize now that that buneary must be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, darlings! I hope you enjoyed your massage~\u201d The mienshao cooed, and as you crawled off the table, you realized you still felt\u2026 heavy. You soon realize that\u2019s because this whole digestive process actually caused you to gain weight! Swaying beneath you was a sizable potbelly of your own, and your rump had gone from flat to rather round and soft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same applied to Andre, although you were too flustered to inspect his newfound pudge yet, especially knowing that that buneary girl added to it. You can only wonder how many Pokemon were part of his pudgy form, all forgotten about years ago\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Asha! You\u2019re the best, as always!\u201d He replies as you walk out of the shop. Now much lighter, if still pudgier, he took a great big breath of the fresh air as he trotted back through downtown. \u201cSo, any other parts of town you wanted to see, Kristina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, you decided...</span></div></div>",

When the two of you arrive at the largest building Emerald comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good good, I was a little worried considering the inclinations of your new friend.\" He gives you a knowing smile before pointing towards a cart with one of his vines. \"The cart itself is filled with water barrels, just pulling it will distribute water along the field.

You kind of expected the bug to be a bit stronger but it goes down with only one blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was anti climatic.\" You say with a bit of a tilt of your head. \"I kinda thought they'd be a bit harder with how worried you were\" As you look back at Andre you notice the caterpie he took down is already halfway down his gullet. \"You weren't kidding were you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" gulping noises as his eyes say it all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"right, guess no one minds since they're thieves after all\" you look down at the other caterpillar Pokemon. </span></div></div>",

All you seem to be doing is coating the smaller Pokemon in drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax a bit, just do what comes naturally.

It takes a moment but you find your jaws parting just enough to engulf it's tail. Breathing through your nose you slowly start working your way up the KO'd bug. While the flavor is good, the softer flesh of the bug definitely gives a squishier texture than you were expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, take it slow. Keep swallowing\" Andre encourages you as you go. \"One and two and one and two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his encouragement it's not long before you find yourself gulping down the last of the Caterpie. \"phew, that was harder than I thought it'd be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry keep swallowing mon's and eventually you'll even be able to eat pokemon that are bigger than you!\" Andre beams at you before turning to continue working. \"Well snack times over, time to get back to it!\" He practically bounces, while you find yourself dragging your swollen belly along.

Food and water was scarce, and several Pok\u00e9mon were desperate to do anything to alleviate their hunger and thirst. This Riolu, Ray, was one of those lonely Pok\u00e9mon. For a while, he'd lived a happy life with his parents, them able to scrape by with what little scraps they could muster, though lately those scraps were getting smaller and smaller. So, maybe Ray should've seen it coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to bed, his family not having a meal one day. And when he woke up, he was at the other side of the town, left in some alley. He fought through his hunger and tried to approach his home, where he could swear he'd see his parents were in. However, the door was locked. He tried knocking and kicking the door, but they never responded to him. After several minutes of trying to get their attention, Ray realized that he was officially locked out. They must've thought that they would've all starved if they kept feeding him! At least, that was one point of view to have. Another point of view was that they grew greedy and were sick of sharing the food with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he realized he couldn't get in anymore, he sat down at the front door to his home, burying his head into his knees in a show of depression. He took a few moments to take solace in his unfortunate condition, not even paying attention to his grumbling belly for a few moments. But, soon, he decided that he couldn't just sit here. Maybe his starved body would terrify his parents, but he didn't feel like wasting away, not now! No, he'd have to survive. He got up, and looked back at the front door sadly, before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question was, does he want to go back, or is he too mad to see them again? Is he gonna try to make things better for his family so he can live at home again, or is he gonna stay away from them and make a living for himself?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surely they wouldn't have done this if the situation wasn't so dire, right? Ray decided that if he were to solve this issue, then he'd have to make sure his family had enough food to make it, even if he lived with them! Unfortunately, that might be easier said than done. Everyone else is struggling due to the recent drought, and many of them are gonna be more inclined to hoarding the food for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, recently a guild has entered town. This guild promises to help out the residents of Juniper Town, from making sure there's a steady supply of food here, to potentially finding out the cause of this drought. He figured these guys might be able to help out his family, though just looking at them earlier, Ray noticed that there were already many Pok\u00e9mon running towards them asking for help. The Riolu already doubted that he'd be able to get a request in for his family in a timely manner, let alone wait long enough for the food to arrive. If he were to make a difference with those guys, then maybe he'd have to work alongside them and get some compensation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also heard rumors about an underground market hoarding some food in anticipation for the eventual famine. They seemed to expect to make a lot of money out of whatever they can scrounge up. Ray might not have a lot of money right now, but maybe if he could find that market soon, he could either get the food at a discount, or maybe he could work out a deal? Heck, they were bad guys, maybe he could get away with taking some of their food for himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, heck, those guild guys were probably gonna grab some food from a different area to keep the area safe. What'd stop him from taking some of that food himself? He heard of a forest far west, though the citizens seemed weary about going that way. It's a long way away, there aren't a lot of rations for a travel, and some seemed to believe the path over held some dangerous outlaws. Few said what was actually in the forest, but it's apparently fairly fertile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay had a few options available, but not a lot of time to do them. If he were to make a decision, he'd have to make it fast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray decided right now his best chance of getting some food was by working with this guild. Maybe they offered benefits after all? Guess there's only one way to find out. So, he decided to check out the oceanic guild, down at the southern edge of Juniper Town. These guys traveled by water, word has it that they rode in on the backs of a wailmers, multiple being used so that the guild can travel the waters to multiple locations at once. The crowd seemed to be thick here, but Ray needed to get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately began shoving through the crowd, dragging his face past several butts and squeezing past several stomping legs. He got several nasty barks and snarls, but he didn't care to listen to them, right now, he just wanted a chance to come back home. He was soon at the front of the crowd, where he could see the guild leader himself, Slowking. He seemed to pose regally and waved to the shouting crowd, which only barely formed a line to a duo of Smeargles, them using their tails to jot down requests of whoever was at the front of the, by some definition, line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Ray didn't need to deal with those guys. No, he kept charging in through the crowd, shuffling past several legs, and soon before one of the smeargles. But, before one of the angry Pok\u00e9mon waiting their turn could bark at him, Ray ran past the smeargles and over to the waving Slowking. He ran and ran, his face soon close to the crowned, pink Pok\u00e9mon's gut. He seemed surprised at the riolu's approach, and looked down at him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey kid,\" he said with a dopey voice. \"You know there's a line, right?\" There wasn't a trace of venom in the guild master's voice, more like genuine wonderment, like he actually wasn't sure if Ray knew he had to wait his turn. He heard the crowd of Pok\u00e9mon shouting, each having waited to speak with the guild to get some work done. This made Ray feel uneasy about speaking with this guy, but he needed to speak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mr. Guild master, I-\" Ray started, kneeling down to him. But the Slowking gently placed a hand on the riolu's shoulder and guided him upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Earl,\" the Slowking said as he stood the boy up. He rubbed the back of his head nervously, but continued his speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earl, I... I want to join your guild,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents are in need of food. We've struggled to get meals, I haven't eaten since noon yesterday, my parents even kicked me out so they could get more food for themselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I need to get food so I can get home! I-I'll work with you guys if that's what it takes! I'll travel with you to get some of it! Just please, give me the chance to bring it home!\" At that, Earl seemed kind of slow on the uptake, shuffling to the side so Ray was now facing his right side. Earl placed a hand on his chin in contemplation, considering the pros and cons of potentially hiring this boy. He let out a \"hmmmm\" of deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem awfully young to be out in the field... And we do encounter some dangerous stuff out there...\" He stroked his chin, \"hmmmmm\"-ing louder. \"Then again, we could always use more hands, especially with how many people need help right now...\" He gave a few more strokes, before turning towards Ray and speaking. \"Alright, kid, how'd you like to be an honrouary member?\" At hearing that, Ray's tail began wagging and he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes please!\" he said, clasping his hands together excitedly. Earl smiled at that, and gently patted his head. At the same time, another Pokemon approached Earl from behind him. It was a weavile, a lady with a cold demeanor and a scowl seemingly plastered on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure this town thanks you for your services to this town.\" Earl then turned towards the Weavile. \"Meg, why don't you show this boy to the Normal Rankers.\" The Weavile, apparently named Meg, nodded, and approached, holding out her hand to Ray. He nervously brought up her own hand, and placed it in hers. With that, she turned around and led Ray, the Pokemon crowd now back to focusing on the Sneasels before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg and Ray didn't speak. Meg didn't seem like the kind of lady to speak normally, and Ray felt too nervous to say anything to her. She eventually led him to a small inn the guild procured for their members. She opened up the door, and headed inside, where the smell of drunkeness instantly made Ray's nose crinkle up. He covered up his nose as Meg led him to one of the upper floors, where there'd be a few doors one'd use to sleep at. The rooms in this inn are notably more spacious than most, supposedly to accomodate some of the bigger Pokemon that show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she guided him, he saw some of the doors had signs on them, each bearing a symbol. They each seemed to be a white ball, bisected by a black line, with a pair of gold wings on the sides, and a big circle in the middle of those balls. He only had the chance to really look at a few doors, there were more with other signs. However, the circle seemed to be of a different color on each door. He passed a door with a diamond-blue circle, a door with a gold-yellow circle, a circle with a gray-silver circle, and a circle with a bronze-green circle. Meg led him to a door with a lavendar circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These rooms are divided by ranks,\" Meg said. \"As a beginner, you'll be assigned to the Normal Rank room, where you'll find a medal shaped just like this door's symbol. Hold onto it, and the mission director will assign you accordingly. You'll also be able to bunk with likwise Normal Rank Pokemon. You can visit some of the higher rank rooms, though currently guildmembers are being chaperoned to make sure too many people aren't in one room, so make sure you sleep in your assigned room. The more work you do for the guild, the quicker you'll rise up the ranks. If you have any questions, leave it to your fellow Normal Rankers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she let go of Ray's hand and stepped away, heading towards the stairs and going down it, likely to meet up with Earl again. Ray looked around at the currently empty tavern, and then back at that \"Normal Rank\" door. He guessed he'd have to get used to this. Though he was appreciative of the temporary home, he kept in mind that this wouldn't be permanent. He just has to do this long enough to get food to his family. With a breath in, followed by a breath out, he grabbed the handle, and opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the door, the first Pokemon he sees is...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had dark black fur on his torso, a lighter black fur around his legs like a pair of pants, and white fur on his head. The Pok\u00e9mon turned around, and Ray was looking at a face with black-ringed eyes, and a mouth that looked like it was conditioned to look condescend to Pok\u00e9mon. He confidently put his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! They finally sent me some boy to back me up!\" he said. \"Now, how many punks have you beat up?\" That made Ray's eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat up?\" Ray repeated. At that, the Pancham sighed, rubbing his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, you're really new, aren't you?\" the Pancham said. \"Well, lucky you, you got yourself the toughest Normal Ranker here!\" He then wrapped an arm over Ray's shoulders, pulling him in close. \"Now, why don't we head out and see what you can do? We can train you out in the field, the wild is the best teacher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I-I guess so?\" Ray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now, let's get you down and get you a and me a job. My knuckles have been itching for a fight!\" The Pancham then began to lead the Riolu down the stairs. \"Other Normal Rankers are out training or doing some other job. You'll get to know your fellow workers when we get back.\" Ray soon found himself down to the floor level, and the Pancham leading him to the cellar the inn's drinks were stored. And down there, he could see a desk set up among the wine racks. And behind that desk was an Abra, him managing the job list. He turned his head towards the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Bruno,\" the Abra said. \"Nice to finally see you come down here finally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blame the guild,\" the Pancham apparently named Bruno said. \"They didn't give me a buddy for as long as I've been here.\" At that, Ray looked at Bruno curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you fought for the guild?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not while employed,\" Bruno said. \"Anyway, Stevie? What've you got?\" The Abra apparently named Stevie nodded. He then used his psychic powers to pull up a file with that Normal Rank symbol stamped on its front. He then opened it up, and Bruno was looking at a few jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helping farm fields? Litter control? Pfff, what, do you want me to walk some old lady across the street next?\" Bruno asked sarcastically. He then began searching through a few of the jobs, as if cherry picking for a particular one. He plucked a few, and hopped down, holding them excitedly. \"Check these out! These look like they have some punks we gotta pound!\" Definitely seems like Ray was gonna get roped into a fight anyways. He sighed and looked down at the missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This one says that there's a band of Noibats that linger within the closest forest. When Pok\u00e9mon try to snatch food from it, it's said these guys snatch up those travelers, do who knows what, and then toss them far from the forest. Victims are reported to either be wet or stinky. Or both. The client here asks for the Noibats to be driven far away.<br>\r\n-A Tyrunt has been seen chomping on rocks nearby. It wouldn't be a problem normally, except around the time the Tyrunt began eating, several Roggenrolas have been reported as missing. The client asks that Pok\u00e9mon make sure this Tyrunt isn't eating Pok\u00e9mon, and if he did, then to make him stop.<br>\r\n-A Midnight Lycanroc is leading some Rockruffs in a pack of thieves. Juniper Town has sent requests for caravans to send food and seeds, but this pack has intercepted them and stolen their goods. These punks need to be gotten rid of!<br>\r\n-A Slurpuff is giving off an obnoxiously sweet smell downtown. Not to mention how much she likes to grope Pokemon. She calls it cuddling, but there are many reports of her hands grabbing places they shouldn't. And then there's the licking- She needs to get out before she ends up slurping up some Pokemon</span></div></div>",

Most of the times, they just bring food to feed all the hungry bellies of the town. Other times, though, they bring a fresh load of passengers and new faces to the humble village of Juniper Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train\u2019s horn let out a cute toot-toot as it slowly slid to a stop at the train station, its many moving steel parts creaking to a stand still. It clicked and clanked and settled where it was for a while\u2026 before finally, one of the thick wooden doors slid open by themselves\u2026 revealing a chubby flygon! He was dressed in a fancy tweed vest and a matching bowler hat, looking out nervously over the town as he stepped onto the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, here we are. Juniper Town. New beginnings. No need to be so anxious, Samuel\u2026 everything will turn out just fine here\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, the flygon in question, try to think soothing thoughts to yourself as you meander off the train station, immediately almost being overwhelmed with just how many Pokemon of all shapes and sizes there were chatting and walking around! You had grown up in a small little town in the mountains, so having to squeeze your way through such crowded streets was new to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave sheepish smiles and little greetings to the Pokemon your chubby form accidentally bumped into, as you attempted to navigate your way through the large town. You had just come from Woodruff Village, after you felt like trying to find a new life in a larger town would be the best way to pursue your dreams\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, though. You have to find a place to stay for at least the night. You have a satchel thrown over your shoulder which contains food, clothing, and seventy-five pok\u00e9s, which would be enough to rent a room for a week back in Woodruff Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you stumble into the cheapest, smallest little inn you could find, panting a bit in relief as you finally escape the bustling crowds. You nervously adjust your vest as you glance over into the eyes of the massive, fat purugly behind the counter, glaring at you with a severely unimpressed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026 hello, miss!\u201d You give her a sheepish smile as you take a step closer, sweat dripping down your forehead. \u201cI\u2019m new to this lovely town, and I was just thinking of inquiring as to how much a room would cost for the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hundred-fifty pok\u00e9s,\u201d she growls, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 oh dear\u2026\u201d You\u2019re a little taken about. A hundred fifty a night\u2026? Back in your village, an inn like this would be closer to ten! Your anxiety spikes as it fully dawns on you just how much more expensive everything around here was going to be\u2026! \u201cHmm. I shall be back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble out of the hotel, thinking. You had to make at least enough money to sleep somewhere for the night. After that, you could find long-term options\u2026 \u201cNow, where can one find employment around here on such short notice\u2026?\u201d You said, munching on a poffin from your satchel to calm your nerves\u2026 until your eyes suddenly happen to land on a big wooden board nearby! \u201cOh! The help wanted board! Of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trotted up to the board, looking over all of the assignments that you could do in just this afternoon, all of which would give you just enough to get that inn room for the night. Hmmm\u2026 there\u2019s a job from a delphox whose daughter wants to learn to be a chef, and needs a taste tester\u2026 and one from the eating contest, who needs someone to announce each contest...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s definitely not just because you\u2019re unable to resist the prospect of free food or anything! No way! Although\u2026 you do have to wonder if the chef-in-training\u2019s recipes are going to be any good\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little surprised they would invite strangers into their home, but you figure that the Pokemon around this town must just be very trustworthy. You stretch out your wings, taking the opportunity to fly over to the address listed on the board, happy to get off the crowded streets\u2026 though, you noticed, even the sky was a little crowded with flying Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you finally landed at that humble little home on the outskirts of town, bustling with that Juniper Town charm. You couldn\u2019t help but smile at the beautiful, quaint decorations as you trotted up the steps, and knocked gently on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard movement within\u2026 and before you knew it, a sizable delphox lady pulled the door open with a knowing smile! Your cheeks went a little red as you paused for a moment. She was quite on the large side herself, with a big, round, soft-looking belly, along with incredibly wide, perfectly shaped hips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good afternoon!\u201d She grinned warmly down at you while you took a moment to compose herself, trying not to stare at her pudgy, perfectly curvaceous body. \u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, actually\u2026\u201d You wring your hands nervously, having trouble meeting her gaze what with those beautiful, piercing eyes of her\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m here about that\u2026 taste testing job\u2026 on the town message board\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up with recognition. \u201cAaaah! Of course! I\u2019ve been waiting for quite a while for someone to answer that! My daughter is quite excited!\u201d She reached out, her warm hand shaking her. \u201cMy name is Lola! Your\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Samuel,\u201d you nod, as you sheepishly trot into her home, looking around at just how cozy everything seemed to be. \u201cYou have a\u2026 wonderful home, miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, why, thank you! It\u2019s nice to meet you Samuel. Of course, you should meet the little chef-to-be, too!\u201d She smiled, cupping her hands around her mouth before shouting. \u201cOpal! The taste tester is here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you can hear little excited running upstairs\u2026 and before you knew it, an cheerful, young braixen was trotting quickly down the hall, wearing the cutest chef\u2019s hat! Before you knew it, she had grabbed your hand, vigorously shaking it! \u201cOh my goodness! I\u2019ve been waiting forever for another one since the last time! It\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake her hand, but you can\u2019t help but feel a little nervous. You\u2019re surprised nobody else would\u2019ve gone for a taste testing job, after all this time. Did these two have a reputation? You couldn\u2019t contemplate that for long, though, as Opal was already leading you deeper into the house. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to work right away, sir! I\u2019ve got so many recipes I need to try!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girl\u2019s mother just giggled. \u201cHave fun, you two!\u201d With that, you were led deeper into the house by the much smaller \u2018mon, before being pushed onto a big, comfortable chair in the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, just wait right here, sir! I\u2019ll cook all of the tastiest treats you\u2019ve ever eaten in a jiffy!\u201d The braixen seemed endearingly excited about cooking, leading you to calm down a bit, sitting in that chair and admiring the house around you as she trotted off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, a delicious fragrance was wafting from the kitchen as she cooked! Smelling it, you couldn\u2019t help but drool, your belly grumbling loudly. You haven\u2019t had a big, proper meal all day! And it seemed that was what you were going to get\u2026 as the braixen soon trotted back, happily carrying a tray of food in either hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, sir! Hot out of the oven!\u201d She smiled, setting down each tray on either side of you, adorned with all sorts of various assorted foodstuffs. \u201cJust lemme know how much you like each recipe, from one to turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod to the young girl, but gently picking up a berry stew, and slurping it up contemplatively. To your relief, it was, indeed, quite delicious! It all slid down your throat before you even knew it, leaving you to lick your lips, cooing at the flavor. \u201cOooh! That was a good one! I\u2019ll give it an 8.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool! Now here, try these poffins!\u201d Before you could even react, the braixen was already shoving poffins down your paw! Just about the time you managed to swallow one of them, another one was already being shoved past your lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give it a eig- mph! An eig- MPH!\u201d You keep trying to squeak out responses, but she doesn\u2019t even give you any time before excitedly shoveling more food right down your gullet! \u201cO-Opal! Think you might slow down- mph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason you don\u2019t really try to stop her was the fact that the food was so good it lured you into a trance, almost. You were starting to realize why most Pokemon avoided this job\u2026 she cooked so much food, and was so dedicated to feeding it to you, that you knew you were going to gain a ton of weight just from this meal alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the trays were soon empty, and she ran off, giving you some time to breathe. You sigh, looking down and poking your now huge, rounded tummy, feeling it slosh and heave as the food inside shifted around. You thought it was over\u2026 until the young Braixen came back with even more trays of food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, hey, uh, you might wanna slow down there, Opal. I don\u2019t know if I wanna get too stuff- mph!\u201d You just barely managed to squeak out a protest before she got right back to feeding you, and you could feel your stomach churn as it struggled to contain the massive meal! You were only halfway through the buffet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach just kept growing, and growing, and growing, bigger than it\u2019s ever been before as she stuffed it more and more, giggling with giddy excitement all the while! You were just focusing on the test, trying to weather the storm of the extreme buffet! Eventually, she finally ran out of food to feed you, and you take a deep breath of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go! All of my recipes! How were they?\u201d She smiled, her tail wagging cutely as she looked expectantly up at you, hoping you\u2019d like her cooking! You sighed, looking down at your huge, round belly, wondering how it even managed to fit all that food in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a\u2026 ten,\u201d you eventually relent, unable to stay mad at her cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! I knew it! I think I\u2019m ready to be a real chef! Thank you, mister!\u201d She smiled, jumping forward and hugging you\u2026 but as you did, your belly let's out a big sloshing noise as it was jiggled, only causing her to giggle even more as she starts kneading the firm softness. \u201cWow, your tummy is sooo big and squishy now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s cause you\u2019ve stuffed it to the brim\u2026!\u201d You pout! She didn\u2019t take your annoyance too seriously, though, as she started to climb right onto your huge belly!  \u201cWha\u2026 hey! Get off there!\u201d You tried to take her off of your stomach, but it was too big for you to reach your arms around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left utterly helpless as the braixen starts happily jumping up and down on your huge, bouncy, squishy gut, causing it to slosh and jiggle like crazy with every jump! \u201cHehe! Wheee!\u201d She was cheering, celebrating her culinary victory with a nice bit of trampoline bouncing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey! I didn\u2019t sign up to be used as a trampoline\u2026!\u201d You protest, only to pause when her bouncing starts to bring up gas! \u201cUuuurrppp!\u201d You let out a sudden belch, a reminder of the sheer amount of food packed away into your surprisingly stretchy gut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you just give up all together, exhausted from your buffet and just slumping back in your chair and letting yourself be used as a simple belly trampoline. \u201cUrgh\u2026 this is not what I was expecting when I took this job\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you were roused from your stupor by the sound of someone approaching. It was that fat delphox lady, who walked in and smiled when she saw you, huge and stuffed to the absolute brim, with the braixen happily napping sprawled out on your huge belly as if it was just a bed. \u201cWell, I see you two had fun!\u201d Lola giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she did\u2026\u201d You pout. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me I was going to get this stuffed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s part of being a taste tester!\u201d The delphox smiled, reaching forward and laying a hand against the distended skin of your overly stretched-out belly. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t any difficulty about it, Pokemon would be lining up around the block just for the free food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, shrugging. \u201cYeah, I guess\u2026\u201d You say. \u201cSo\u2026 is that all you needed?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The only sound on the streets was the faint tune of waves breaking on the shore, the wind blowing back creaky signs\u2026 and of course, the rancor of that macabre congregation. In the center of town, Pokemon of all shapes and sizes were dancing and baying and laughing, gathered around a campfire as they sung, and sung, and sung their terrible song\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining inhabitants - those who haven\u2019t either been evacuated or lost their minds completely - huddled away in their darkened homes, their doors and windows barricaded, trying to do their best to block out that terrible sound. Some of them were haunted by the knowledge that it was their family and friends singing in that congregation\u2026 and some of them were haunted by the knowledge that it was their family and friends digesting away in those countless gurgling guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamico was one of the lucky ones, more or less. The absol had been new in town; he didn\u2019t know any of the Pokemon that have become victims of this dreaded curse. It had been around noon when he heard a scream coming from the town plaza, and before even bothering to see what exactly was going on, he had already ducked into a nearby general store to hide away. This decision ended up saving his life, as he discovered when he peeked out a window to witness the carnage unfolding in the center of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like dozens of Pokemon had gone mad! Their eyes glowing a deep shade of yellow as they ran laughing and hollering from the streets, chasing other Pokemon down and\u2026 well\u2026 swallowing them whole! Seeming to revel in those squirming bulges stretching out their necks as they happily devoured random townsfolk like meals, or toying with them in their maws and teasing their prey by dangling them just above their cavernous throats, before letting gravity slide them down in a single gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few Pokemon managed to run in and hide away in the general store before they barricaded the door. \u201cW-w-we\u2019re all gonna diiiieeee-hie-hieeee!\u201d One of them, a delibird, was sobbing into her flippers, sat on a desk. She was crying\u2026 loudly. Too loudly. Damico was staring daggers at her, but she wouldn\u2019t taking a hint. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get\u2026 get\u2026 GURGLED\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to die, Marla,\u201d the shopkeeper, a manectric, mournfully shook his head as he patted her on the back, trying to calm her down mostly so her crying doesn\u2019t lure those predators to their hideout. \u201cThe guild\u2019s doing everything it can to fix all this. Once they\u2019re done with the evacuation effort, they\u2019ll surely send in teams to save our skins. You\u2019ll see.\u201d You thought that, too\u2026 but you\u2019re starting to doubt it. It\u2019ll take those predators an average of 24 hours to digest their prey, but once they do, they\u2019ll have room for more\u2026 and they started over 12 hours ago, so time is running short...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is all that damn jolteon\u2019s fault,\u201d insisted a more cranky cinccino, his arms crossed in the corner as if this was all an annoyance to him. \u201cI told you all, you can\u2019t trust fancy new technology like those weird instruments of her\u2019s! It\u2019s dangerous! But did anybody listen to me? No, of cooouuurse not. Nobody EVER listens to Randy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s just\u2026 look, we need to calm down, okay? There\u2019s nothing we can do other than wait to be rescued\u2026\u201d The manectric stood up all of a sudden, seeming frustrated with the situation. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got some sleeping bags in the back\u2026 why don\u2019t we just call it a night? Get some much-needed rest. Sound good\u2026?\u201d The room was silent. Nobody, not even the delibird, had a problem with that plan. It was long after midnight, and they exhausted as could be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even in their dreams, they would find no reprieve. Their restless nightmares would be haunted by visions of that\u2026 concert. The concert that started this whole mess. Just a travelling band setting up their stage in the middle of town. Three of them were robed figures, making it impossible to tell just what species they were supposed to be\u2026 but one, their lead singer, was a jolteon glam rocker, with a fancy high-tech electric guitar she powered with her own electricity! Damico had to admit, she looked pretty damn cool\u2026 but the longer they played, the more Pokemon crowded around the stage, as if mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until the concert reached its encore, though, that things really went south. With a laugh, that strange jolteon gal let out one last powerful shred with that guitar\u2026 and the audience members, well\u2026 in that moment, they just\u2026 changed. Their eyes glew a golden yellow, their demeanors became so much more feral and unhinged, and overall, they became a single, functioning unit with only one goal; to devour as many Pokemon as possible! What ensued was a display of such gluttony and hedonism, none of them would ever forget it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Many citizens in Juniper Town advised against traveling to the outskirts, for fear of some dangerous outlaws. However, there are a few that ignore those orders, either because they're too young to comprehend the danger, or they're sick of staying in town all the time, or they're looking for something on the outskirts... maybe a few are even enamored with the danger. As for the Espurr stepping out of town, he grew sick of the very strict practices his parents kept him under. They wanted to make sure he kept proper posture, always walked at a specific pace, always at in a specific way... He wanted to keep away from his mom and dad and just use this moment to really stretch his muscle. Already he was beginning his rebellion, increasing the pace of his steps and decreasing at seemingly random intervals, all while swaying side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting farther and farther from the village, all the better to keep away from his parents after all. He also made sure to leave under the cover of night so his dark fur would blend in more. He didn't seem to understand just how dangerous this was... so maybe it was time for a reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was soon a good mile away from the town gates, and he could see, on top of some grass beside the path, there were several large rocks Pok\u00e9mon used to lounge about on their hike. The Espurr decided it was time to rest his little feet, so he stepped off the path and towards one of the large rocks, being forced to leap up so he could land butt first on it. He sighed and began massaging his paws a little, trying to calm them down. He took a moment to suck in some fresh air, air untainted by the many citizens cluttering the town. He sniffed some more, closing his eyes to enjoy the loneliness. However, as he sniffed, he picked up anther scent... He didn't recognize that smell, so his eyes opened up curiously, and he began scanning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem lost, little one~\" he heard a voice say. It sounded feminine, and had a certain purr to it. The Espurr's head snapped around, trying to get a reading on where that voice came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" he declared. \"Who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you're the stranger here, I think I reserve the right to ask a few questions,\" he heard. \"You say you're not lost, eh? What brings you out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was trying to be alone,\" he answered, now standing up on the rock and looking around, looking out for this weirdo. He was met with a soft chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alone?\" she said with a tone of bemusement. \"Why would you want to be alone out here? Hasn't mommy and daddy told you about the monsters lingering out here?\" This time, he thought he heard a rustle in the grass, likely a sneaky creep. He turned towards the grass, and held his hands to his temples, preparing a psychic attack. He focused on the place that rustling grass came from, summoned up the psychic energy of a Confusion strike, and centered it on that point. However, he didn't feel the attack connect with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tend to have my crew with me, but, to be honest, sometimes I find I'm my own best friend~\" He then saw something rise up out of the grass, it uncomfortably close to the rock field. She was a fairly big feline, the back of her coat being a dark purple, dotted with yellow rosettes. She also seemed to bear pink marking around her eyes akin to domino mask. Her under fur was more yellow, the purple around her fur ending around the ankles to giveway to yellow fur. Most people in Juniper Town would recognize this as a Liepard. This particular one was known as Mercedes, a wicked outlaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped closer, and the Espurr attempted another psychic attack, only for another rustle of grass to attract him. Looking towards it he saw... another Mercedes? Another noise came from behind him, and again, he saw Mercedes. Mercedes here, Mercedes there, Mercedes everywhere, nearly forming a ring around them. He summoned up his confusion powers, and frantically struck one of them, only for them to fade into darkness as if they never existed. He turned towards another approaching one and attempted again, but it disappeared too. He kept trying to hit them, but they each seemed to just fade at the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could pull off one more strike, the Liepards faded away, all except for one, which leapt up and rammed a forepaw into the Espurr's chest, shoving him down and pinning him against the rock beneath. He squirmed about, kicking his legs and trying to lift her leg with his hands. He kept struggling even as she chuckled. Then, she leaned down, lolling her tongue out of her mouth, and dragged it up his face, causing him to shiver with disgust as her saliva stained him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty~\" she cooed out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mercedes gave the Espurr another lick and slowly dragged her tongue across his fluffy chest until it stopped at his cheek, giving her captive a clear view of the inside of her mouth. By all means she was planning on eating the little Pokemon but she suddenly realized who this Espurr was, or rather, who his parents were. They were two pedantic Meowstics that lived in the town that were obsessed with their social image in the eyes of the other townsfolk that also just so happened to be quite wealthy. During the times she infiltrated the town to purloin some goods their house stood out as being more lavish than the others but she never had the opportunity to break in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment ago she was ready to clamp her jaws down and make a quick meal out of this Espurr but now a much better idea was forming in her mind; one that would end up getting her <i>much</i> more food. After dragging her tongue across the rest of his face she closed her mouth and smiled down at the smaller Pokemon. The Espurr mumbled as he worked up the courage to speak to her. \"Are- Are you going to eat me?\" He fearfully asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifled a chuckle. \"No, I think I've got a better idea,\" she said. Releasing her paw from her captive she was happy to see that the he knew he was defeated. It was something Mercedes found happened a lot to the Pokemon she beat; they just lie still and hope she goes away, or perhaps they know resisting was futile. The Espurr let out a yelp when she batted him with a paw and made him roll over onto his belly. Mercedes leaned down and slowly whispered into his ear. \"Please don't make me change my mind.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she bit down on his exposed neck and lifted him up. The Liepard had already formulated a plan for the lone Pokemon in her jaws as she set off for the direction of her camp. She was going to put the Espurr up for ransom! Based on what she had seen and heard of the Meowstic family they were wealthy and if they truly valued the life of their child they would definitely pay up for his release. The terms will be simple; a large sum of Pok\u00e9 that they could realistically pay, no contact with any other Pokemon, meeting at her desired location and a time limit of one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued wandering through the dark forest, intermittently increasing the pressure her jaws had around the Espurr's neck whenever he started to protest. The Espurr groaned as she took him deeper into the forest, unsure of where he was in relation to the town as she took bends and turns seemingly at random. Before long the light of a small campfire began piercing through the trees as she approached her camp. Being outlaws, they could not afford the luxury of a permanent residence and instead had to resort to occasionally moving their staging area. Either way, the mess of tents and equipment was what Mercedes could call home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see her comrades all sitting around the campfire laughing and exchanging jokes. Around the fire were outlaws just like her; a large Serperior, a reserved Honchkrow, a brooding Zoroark and a strong Mightyena with his little Poochyena brother by his side. A flick of the Mightyena's ear told Mercedes that he heard her approaching and he was about to call out to her before he saw the mischievous look on the Liepard's face. By now the others were noticing her, too, all except the Poochyena. Silently she approached as all of them tried to continue their conversations while concealing their amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow practically standing right behind the oblivious Poochyena, Mercedes slowly eased the Espurr in her mouth forward until he was dangling right next to his face. The completely defeated Espurr was a miserable sight to behold but when Poochyena saw its large purple eyes right next to him he yelped and jumped in the air out of shock. A cacophony of laughter at his expense was triggered as he tried to compose himself. Mercedes dropped the Espurr to the ground and playfully reprimanded the shocked Poochyena. \"You need to be more aware of your surroundings, Kip. Your brother heard me coming from a mile away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKip only let out an embarrassed groan before he sat back down. The laughter started to die down and the Mighyena, Harv, greeted her. \"You're back, boss!\" he exclaimed. \"And I see you've brought a snack home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes gave him an innocent giggle. \"No, we're not eating this one. I found him all by his lonesome and I was lucky enough to remember that this one comes from a very wealthy house. If they want him back they're gonna have to pay~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you're the boss, boss!\" the female Serperior praised. \"You make the best plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm,\" Mercedes hummed as she looked over her crew. Despite being leader the Liepard was actually the latest member of the small band of misfits. When she came across the group their leader was an Espeon that had apparently decided Mercedes was a good target to rob and in the heat of the moment she challenged him to a one-on-one fight with the stakes being leadership of the group. While he was surprisingly tough to beat, she won and decided to display her dominance in the most dramatic way she could think of; eating him alive. It was extremely difficult getting him down but in the end his struggling form was securely trapped in her belly, bulging on display for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer intention was to single out the leader and make sure his underlings knew not to mess with her but they all took the stakes of the match to heart and warily accepted her as being their new leader. On a whim, she accepted it, too. Usually being a loner, Mercedes was out of her element but she quickly picked up how to lead the small crew and worked hard to earn their trust and respect. Now they were like a family to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercedes regarded the Espurr at her feet and spoke up. \"We're going to write up a ransom letter for this little guy and get it delivered tonight. If they fail to pay up then I guess we're just gonna have to eat him.\" Mercedes could already see the Honchkrow, Crowley, ready with pencil and paper. \"Good,\" she said. Sitting next to him she explained what to write on the paper; the ransom price, the location, the deadline and the terms to come alone. The entire crew was peeking over her shoulder as she proof-read the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all your asking for?\" the Zoroark asked. \"I mean, it's a lot but couldn't we get more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we ask for too much then they'll be forced to ask for help. If they can pay for it themselves then they probably won't seek help if it means protecting their family's 'perfect' image from being tarnished and result in a quick and easy transaction with no retaliation from the guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew all hummed in understanding. \"That's why you're the best, boss!\" Harv cheered. Mercedes rolled the letter up and passed it to Crowley who firmly grasped with one of his talons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where to drop it?\" she asked. The Honchkrow merely nodded before he took off in flight. Mercedes was confident in her plan but as any experienced leader would, she still felt worried about the outcome. Having devised numerous plans during her time as the group's leader she knew to expect the unexpected. It was entirely possible that the Meowstic family might defy her expectations and simply contact the guild that recently showed up in town but she was hoping it would not come to that. If it worked, though, she and her crew would be able to afford a whole entire feast and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we wait,\" Mercedes said as she turned to the Espurr. He was sitting next to the fire with a grim expression on his face that made her almost feel sorry for him. She decided everyone would take shifts sleeping to make sure he doesn't try and run away in the night and then move to the meeting spot in the morning. What would happen after that is up to the Meowstic family.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While many members of the guild enjoyed sleeping on a calm bed and letting the soft surface whisk them to sleep, there are a few that prefer to sleep in their element. Some of the water types like sleeping in warm water, some of the grass types like sleeping under leaves or in trees, and so on. The Pok\u00e9mon of interest, a ground type meanwhile, tended to sleep in the ground. Burrowed into the dirt was a fairly large, fairly plump, mole-like Pok\u00e9mon with dark brown fur and red markings, along with thick claws and a blade-like protrusion from her forehead. This was an Excadrill, a proficient digger and proficient devourer. She's also kind of notorious for her smell, spending her nights sleeping in the dirt and whatnot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Libby, a lady that was working off some outlaw in her belly through the night. Later, though, with the daytime rising, she stirred awake. She stayed for a moment, trying to detect any movement in her gut. However, everything was silent. She sighed and gently patted her belly, a bit more pudge to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, enjoy your life sentence,\" she said. She then tried to back up, but her body refused to move. She strained and kept trying to squeeze backwards, but she was still stuck! She began to realize her belly fat was getting caught on the dirt walls she'd slept within. \"Oh you're a fighter beyond the end, eh?\" Libby brought one of her claws in front of her, and spread them, them emitting the sound of an unsheathed blade. And so, she began digging upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, near where she slept, there was a tree with a Gligar hanging from it from his tail, him looking down at the ground patiently. This was Simone, Libby's partner in the guild. He seemed to think she should be up soon, and he silently feared that what she ate might've messed her up during her sleep. However, soon the ground split open. He saw a familiar claw pop out, followed by another. With a grunt, Libby hoisted herself upwards, her body splitting more and more of the earth. So, she placed her feet up on the ground and stood up, her plump body now on display for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I gotta get used to bigger holes,\" she noted. She planted her claws around her enlarged gut and gently played with it, lifting it a little before letting go and letting gravity pull it down, jiggling as it flopped back into its original position. Upon seeing her get up, Simone got out of the tree and flew over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd that Electrike taste?\" he asked before settling himself on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the best thing I ate, but certainly not unpleasant.\" She patted her gut and looked up at her partner. She then stretched her body upwards, yawning while she did so, and smacked her lips together as she scratched her back. Then, she began to walk back to the meeting point of the guild. She rode the boat over, and she hated every moment of it. She wasn't built for the water, she just needed to stay on the soil. Ah well, at least she wouldn't have to deal with water for a while while over here. At least not until they deal with whatever brought upon the drought. She ruled the soil, and she'd make sure her girth ruled any small outlaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was back at the meetup point, the boat's deck. She stepped up onto it, and stood near the guild member, a few Pok\u00e9mon picking up her scent and scooting away from her. The Pok\u00e9mon appeared to be taking their missions from Juniper Town, the town in danger. There was the guild member, a Swampert known as Roy, and next to him was the designated job delegator, a Pidove named Sweeny. Libby stood in line and waited for her turn to receive a job. She looked down at her badge, still a Normal Rank. She sighed inwardly. She felt the need to fill her belly up with bigger meals, but she'd need more points before she can graduate from the small fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she didn't need to wait for Sweeny to direct her. Surely there's some townsperson that had to deal with a bigger threat, right? Maybe one of them could use her help.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Libby looks over her badge, and then peeks out towards Juniper Town, considering stepping out. Simone, meanwhile, sat on her shoulder, and realized what she was considering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the last guys didn't exactly pose a challenge,\" Simone began. \"But we can't simply step away from Sweeny here. If we don't turn in an officially assigned job, we won't get points. Meaning that even if you do a favor from someone in Juniper Town, you'll just have to take another job anyway to get tougher jobs.\" At hearing that, Libby considered her options. She then groaned, slumping backwards a little as she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she huffed out. \"More official jobs, the sooner we get to the big fries.\" Simone nodded at that, and so Libby slumped forwards, an upset expression on her face as the line slowly moved forwards... It seemed she was only half way through the line and she already felt like she was taking forever. All she wanted was to find some puny Pok\u00e9mon to pummel, and this pausing line was taking longer and longer for her to get that goal. Though, she figured she might as well check out her body right now... She lifted an arm and sniffed underneath, paying no mind to the Pok\u00e9mon behind recoiling in disgust and covering their mouths and noses. She let out an \"eh\" and brought it down, deciding it gave her edge most of these prudes didn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, and she was 3/4 of the way through. She reached behind her and scratched her itchy back a little. She then tried to get more towards the center of her back, but she couldn't reach. Simone saw this and flew behind her, using his claws to gently scratch. She let out a nice sigh and bent forwards, her tongue lolling out as he scratched. She kept walking forwards as the line did, still enjoying her little back scractcher. Soon enough, the line in front of her was gone, and she approached Sweeny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pidove backed away, his eyes shooting open at seeing her before the line. The same reaction as yesterday. He reached behind him, picking up a pole, and he stuck the mission statement in front of him to the end of it. He lifted it up, and held it up to Libby, just like yesterday. She plucked the mission statement from it, and walked away, sighing angrily at that. It's not her fault she was born for the dirt. Even now, for a few moments on the boat, she felt antsy on top of the water. With the mission in hand, she couldn't get off of this thing sooner. She was soon down on the soil, and let out a sigh of relief, flopping onto her belly and cradling the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you get?\" Simone asked, snapping her out of her own moment of reprieve. She sighed and sat up, not minding that her butt was parked right in front of the bridge from the ship to shore. She opened up the envelope the mission was in, and pulled out the letter, reading the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Missing Seeds</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A group of Nuzleafs were gathering up berry seeds to plant somewhere. However, while they were searching, some rogues grabbed the cart holding the seeds and ran off with them towards some northern valley. If this mission arrives soon enough, those rogues will likely still be on their way there. Reported rogues are a sneasel, a pachirisu, a rockruff, and a munchlax.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibby groaned and pocketed the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buncha small fry stole some stupid seeds,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those seeds might be important nowadays,\" Simone tried to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'll care about what's important soon as I can pummel it.\" Simone flew onto her shoulder, and she began her march towards the valley, seeking out these punks trying to act tough.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sun beating on her back while she pushes herself to the limits, it helps her work up a sweat, and sweat makes it easier to pound those loser Pok\u00e9mon. Simone learned to tolerate Libby, but even now she was threatening to drive him off. Still, he clung to her shoulder like a good friend where no one else would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped her brow, letting out a sigh as she stamped. She didn't seem to pay attention to any potential outlaws. The guys hanging around here weren't usually a big threat. She just had to sit on them or slam her gut on them and they'd be out of commission. Not that any of them dared approach. It just made her trip boring, at least if they showed up she could hear some puny jerk whine for mercy. She considered a game to pass the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, you name a Pok\u00e9mon that'd piss me off,\" she said. Simone looked down curiously, until he remembered this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that...\" he said. \"As you travel, you see some Pancham on the road, hoarding a bunch of performance enhancing supplies prescribed to specific Pok\u00e9mon. He's currently distributing them among a bunch of other Pok\u00e9mon his age-\" His little spiel was interrupted by Libby cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna grab him by the wrist and pull him aside, tell 'im I have some serious words for him,\" Libby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems shocked at first, and then begins pulling against your grip. He keeps trying to free himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just bring down my other arm and hoist 'im up over my shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now he's kicking his feet and banging his fists on your shoulder. Later, he tries to bite you to get free-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's in fer it now! I yank him off of me and roughly throw him onto the ground. There, I place my feet on the ground to the left and the right of him and order him to get into push up position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Pancham isn't going to settle for that. He instead tries to crawl away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave that bug a chance! I throw my legs out from under me, falling ass first on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You land on his back, causing the Pancham's eyes to shoot open as he's sandwiched between the floor and your backside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cross my arms and tell him to lift me up, or else-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I think I see them,\" Simone interrupted. Libby looked ahead, and further on the path, she can definitely see a wagon. She could see a rockruff and a munchlax pushing it while a sneasel and pachirisu sat on top, looking ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These little brats couldn't even get away fast enough!\" Libby noted to herself with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably be careful with these guys. I don't trust that sneasel in particular...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we'll knock those punks down, then we can beat them to our heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it seemed the rockruff and munchlax seemed to be pushing the cart at a slow enough speed. Libby figured she could take her time planning this out. Then again, she was hungry for a few squeals...</span></div></div>",

Libby was keeping up a steady pace, not minding how much she stamped. After all, even from here the duo could hear the wagon grinding of the wagon's turning wheels. Awfully convenient. She was stamping, upping her speed. As she got closer and closer, she shook the shoulder Simone was on, signaling her. He  then lifted his wings and lifted up. He flew up, and began to approach the Rockruff. He latched his legs around the dog Pok\u00e9mon's waist, and then lifted up, carrying him away squealing and writhing. The other Pok\u00e9mon looked towards the source of the squealing, jaws dropping. The Sneasel, however, got up to his feet and stood at the edge of the wagon. He began to charge up an ice beam, but the wagon was suddenly rattled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the rest of them, while Simone was flying off with his prey in his claws, Libby ran up behind the group. She got in close, pivoted, and suddenly rammed against the back of the wagon, smushing the Munchlax against the back and practically flattening him with her backside. The impact shook the wagon, and caused the Sneasel to trip up and fall off the wagon, roughly landing on the dirt. The Pachirisu barely stayed in his wagon, and the Munchlax was beginning to stand up, trying to shake off the cobwebs the impact left in his head. Unfortunately, while he was confused, Libby stood up, a malicious grin beginning to draw on her face. As disappointing as pounding some dweebs was, she had to admit there was some excitement to wearing some brat down into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cracked her knuckles and craned her neck left and right, her muscles audibly popping as she loomed over the Munchlax. She grinned as she readied her next attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uses...</span></div></div>",

She giggled to herself as she felt something, a familiar stirring in her gut. She bent down and picked up the dazed Pokemon, holding him by the ankle and carrying him away from the wagon. Wouldn't want the goods to get in the crossfire after all. Mid-carry, she saw the Munchlax rouse awake, groaning as he realized he was being hoisted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy~\" she cooed, keeping him at arm's length and high above the ground. \"D'ya know who I am? I'm with the local guild. That means it's my job to beat up little troublemakers like you. Now I would normally gobble up little losers like you, but you're in luck. You looks like you're full of so much fat, my arteries'd probably get clogged licking you.\" The Munchlax began squirming about in Libby's grip, terrified about what the excadrill could do to him. His squirming seemed to quiet down when she said she wouldn't eat him, but he still seemed plenty afraid. Libby brought him close, close enough for him to smell her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think that means you're getting off scott free,\" she said. \"After all. I still have to give. You. A warning.\" She punctuated the latter half of her sentance with a taps to his nose. He leaned down a little and easily scooped up a chunk of the dirt, leaving an approximately Munchlax-sized hole in it. She then brought him down, maing sure he went feet first in, before quickly shoveling the dirt in place and leaving him pinned down, his head alone exposed. He squirmed around, grunting and groaning as he tried desparately to get out. His struggling was stopped when he looked ahead, and spied Libby's giant, round, chubby butt faing him, her bending over slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember! You asked for this!\" she said, rubbing her growling gut. Then, she grit her teeth as the Munchlax thrashed around, trying to wedge himself free. Unfortunately, that'd be for not. With a quick grunt, the Munchlax was thrust into a horrific hell, a heat comparable to a furnace surrounding him while his mouth and nose were filled with a rotten, poisonous stench. With a pained cry, the poor Munchlax went limp, completely knocked out by Libby's attack. The crude Excadrill let out a rude laugh upon looking down at the boy, before she sauntered confidently towards the wagon.</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibby was coming back to the wagon, having dealt with one of those brats while Simone was carrying off another. The Pachirisu was rubbing her forehead while the sneasel boy was now beginning to stand up. Good for Libby. That chubby chump didn't quite sate her hunger. She came close to the wagon, and... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, you both managed to qualify for membership right before the massive ship sailed away again, on its way to some place known as Juniper Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm! I mean, unless we get eaten by bandits or something\u2026\u201d You chuckle, in a much better mood now that you\u2019ve had some time to wake up and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater still, the moment\u2019s finally arrived. You all crowd onto the top deck of the ship, the day bright and the wind rippling through your fur, as you all cheer as the new lands finally come into view over the horizon! \u201cJuniper Town\u2026!\u201d You gasp in awe, finally laying eyes on the beautiful, advanced little town built among countless hills, valleys and forests, looking completely in tune with the wonders of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guild members all docked as the hulking ship approached the land, their focus shifted to the sound of the captain\u2019s quarters loudly sliding open. Indeed, emerging was a massive, powerful, pudgy Blastoise, Walton - the captain of the exploration guild! You\u2019d only ever seen Walton just a few times, and you were always in total awe of him! Everyone cheered when he walked out, which he tolerated for a while, before raising a hand, causing everyone to fall silent immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... so. After seven months on our previous expedition, and three weeks at sea, we are finally approaching a new land. A new town. A new fresh start,\u201d he began, in a deep, authoritative voice. \u201cTo the Pokemon here, we are not a mere organization. We are a symbol of hope. And this must be the image we cultivate. While you shall be paid fairly for every mission completed, you mist remember your main goal is not profit, but working to ensure a hopeful future for every innocent Pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJuniper Town - the town you see before you - is a place that needs this hope. Rain isn\u2019t falling, crops aren\u2019t growing, and if this continues, Pokemon might start to go hungry in just a few months. Was it nor for us, it seems likely that this beautiful forest land would just dry up into a sprawling desert. But we\u2019re not gonna let that happen, are we?\u201d He asks, the corners of his lips curling up into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, no, sir!\u201d The guild members all shout in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Whatever\u2019s causing this, we\u2019re gonna track it down, kick its butt, and give these Pokemon a future worth looking forward to. Am I right?\u201d He asks, louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, yes, sir!\u201d Echoes across the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so! Now we\u2019re gonna try and make a good first impression immediately upon landing. Diamond Rank teams and above, focus on meeting and interacting with civilians. They\u2019ll have heard legends of your adventures, so you\u2019ll be like heroes to them. Gold rank teams and below, focus on solving whatever small little problems they need you to deal with. Prove to them that we\u2019re here to help! My first in command, Tobias, shall lead your efforts. Have I made myself clear?\u201d He raises a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, yes, sir!\u201d Everyone shouts one last time, loud enough to make their throats hoarse. With that, the satisfied blastoise returns to his quarters, and Tobias,a rather large and well-dressed vaporeon, trotted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you all get to work, you glance down at your badge\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Foxfire<br>\r\nOliver &amp; Willis<br>\r\nNormal Rank<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, always having wondered why it was called \u2018normal rank\u2019 when it was really just delegated to complete newbies. Hopefully, though, if you work hard enough, you might be silver ranked by the end of this expedition!</span></div></div>",

Tobias makes sure that each mission offered to the guild goes through a strict vetting system, to ensure that it\u2019s not a trap, and that it\u2019ll actually pay fairly, while also ensuring that guild members can\u2019t extort the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Tobias only collects missions sent to the guild, so it\u2019s a more reactive approach. Going out and actively searching for problems to solve is the proactive approach, and it helps find obscure problems that have slipped through the cracks. Since this is your first day on the job, you want to go the extra mile\u2026!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously wring your hands as the boat stops at the docks and begins to drop its anchors, seeing the crowd forming down below. Once the massive ship was finally still, the guild members all began hopping off, ready to meet the curious townspeople come to investigate, chat, and register missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d You turn to Willis for some comfort, only to find that he looks just as nervous as you now, under that bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be!\u201d With a nod towards eachother, you both hop right off that ship, shuffling through the crowd of Pokemon that\u2019s formed. The next minute was a blurry haze of squeezing past Pokemon, saying hello, and answering the occasional question. Luckily, most Pokemon lost interest in you when they realized you were just newbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you finally made it off the docks, and took a knee to take a breath now that you finally had some personal space. You both had little bands around your neck with your guild badge on front, making it obvious that you were civilians, but luckily, most passed you by with nought but a curious glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp, we\u2019re here. Juniper Town! Our very first expedition!\u201d Willis smiled, getting a little excited now that he was finally here. \u201cThere\u2019s adventure around every corner! Like, that shopkeeper over there? I bet he\u2019s dealing with a robbery problem! A mysterious thief\u2026 a bandit in the knight! Oh, or that nidoqueen! I bet she\u2019s a mother, looking for her son, who\u2019s been kidnapped by a tribe of-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright, Willis! Don\u2019t get ahead of yourself, here!\u201d You pat him on the back, trying to calm him down, and he chuckles a bit, still rocking on his heels in excitement. \u201cWe\u2019re just starting out, so we\u2019re probably going to get the boring missions for now. We\u2019ve just got to focus on helping out as much as we can, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, nodding and seeing your point. \u201cOkay, okay. Sorry\u2026\u201d He shrugs. \u201c... I hope we at least get to fight some yummy bandits, eventually\u2026\u201d You can\u2019t help but agree with that. It\u2019s been way too long since you\u2019ve lost had a real Pokemon meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both wander around the absolutely beautiful town, not really knowing how to find quests to do, and being too nervous to ask. Eventually, you both decide you should stop at a little cafe in order to calm your nerves\u2026 and because the smell of that delicious cooking was making your stomach growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You must be two o\u2019 those guild members I\u2019ve been hearing about!\u201d The HUGE, pudgy grumpig chef across the bar smiled at you as the two of you sat down, evidently recognizing your exploration guild badges. \u201cLet me be the first to welcome ya to our humble little town! Can I get ya anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, thank you!\u201d Willis spoke up, blinking at just how polite and friendly the grumpig was, despite being a total strange. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll have a Poke Puff Supreme Wish, and my friend here will have a\u2026\u201d He presses his ear against your belly, pretending to \u2018listen\u2019. \u201c... a Watmel Berry, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem! Coming right up!\u201d The big fat grumpig smiled, before turning and happily getting to work. As the two of you sat there, you suddenly heard another voice speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you two darlings are guild members, hmmm~?\u201d You turned to see, to your surprise, there was a ninetales sitting right next to you! You somehow hadn\u2019t even noticed him! And\u2026 well, if you hadn\u2019t just heard his voice, you would assume he was a female. He definitely had an extremely feminine look about him, you immediately noticed, especially those half-lidded, alluring eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes quickly trace down his body, and you noticed something else about him - his belly was big and bulging! He, apparently, had somebody wriggling around in there, squirming as it bulged and churned all around them. This normally wouldn\u2019t be so strange, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most notable thing about him was his rump! Even squished against the chair beneath him, you could see at a glance that it was just\u2026 absolutely huge! You\u2019ve never seen a derriere that was so\u2026 soft, and\u2026 round, and\u2026 oh, you try to turn your head and look away before that line of thought could get awkward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you just call us\u2026 darlings?\u201d Willis raised a brow, seemed to be a bit intrigued by just the strange way the ninetales was speaking. \u201cUh\u2026 well, yeah! We are guild members, actually! We\u2019re, uh, normal rank, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how fun! I\u2019ve always wanted to meet a guild member~\u201d He smiled, leaning in close with the most strange and alluring smug expression on his face, and you were almost mesmerized as you stared into those glowing eyes. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much to ask\u2026 may I inquire about your services?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even get in a word edgewise, Willis stood up on his chair and pushed your head down so he could look the ninetales in the eyes, obviously getting a little over-excited about the job offer! \u201cFor the right price, definitely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anybody could say another word, the grumpig brought three dishes - your\u2019s and Willis\u2019, as well as a hot stew for the ninetales. \u201cHot out the oven, guys! Enjoy!\u201d The grumpig smiled, and everybody thanked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. We shall discuss business over lunch, then!\u201d The ninetales giggled, before reaching up and starting to gulp down the fancy stew before him. You and Willis join in, trying to clear your head as you swallowed big chunks of the watmel berry, already making your tummy bulge out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I just realized I hadn\u2019t even introduced myself! My apologies. My name is\u2026 Sebastian!\u201d The ninetales smiled, saying his name with some dramatic flair. \u201cAnd I happen to run a little church, where I care for my many followers, and offer them\u2026 \u2018spiritual guidance\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpiritual guidance, huh?\u201d Willis raised a brow, incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you. Some Pokemon out there feel lost and meaningless, and I\u2026 give them purpose. Help them\u2026 contribute to something,\u201d he smiled warmly. \u201cBut just recently, our church has been burglarized! And I\u2019m afraid those scandalous ne\u2019er-do-wells ran off with a truly priceless artifact!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutlaws, sir?\u201d You ask, thinking it over. \u201cWhat sort of artifact did they steal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA life-sized golden sculpture of\u2026 well, my derriere,\u201d he confessed, and both you and Willis immediately did a double take. \u201cI am aware it sounds silly, but I assure you, it is important to the worship at my temple. For its return, I am willing to compensate you happily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Willis both looked at eachother, and having known eachother for so long, you knew exactly what the other was thinking. Willis was wondering if he really wanted his first mission to be recovering some giant golden butt. This ninetales seemed suspicious, too, and this whole church seemed backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were more optimistic. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to help a citizen around this town! And besides, there was just something\u2026 alluring about the ninetales. It was like you wanted to\u2026 serve him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you both make a decision without even needing to speak...</span></div></div>",

By now, you were all filled with your meals, your plates lying empty before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, wonderful! I\u2019m sure you boys are more than up for the task. Now, as a show of good faith, please allow me to pay for your meals,\u201d Sebastian offered, with that alluring little smile of his again, apparently smug in your agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy all means!\u201d The charmeleon smiled, hopping off of his bar stool with his belly rounded and sloshing, letting out a resounding belch. You blushed at just how crude your friend was, giving the ninetales an apologetic look as you hop off your own chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy scouts have pinpointed their location in a little grove northeast of here. I can mark it on your map, if you wish.\u201d Sebastian explained. Sure enough, you held up your map for him, and he marked an area with a little pen he held with his teeth. \u201cThere should be around 6 of the outlaws\u2026 one of them a roserade. Bring that one too me intact for an extra reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be some extra venom in his voice while he spoke of the roserade, which made you a little bit uncomfortable. But Willis thought nothing of it. \u201cAlright, cool! We\u2019ll handle it from here, Sebastian, no worries! C\u2019mon, Oliver! We gotta get that statue before it\u2019s too late!\u201d With that, he trots off, his belly sloshing all the while\u2026 and with a sigh, you follow begrudgingly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the map while he takes point, trotting through the forest together as you navigate based on the many beautiful, natural landmarks scattered around. Eventually, your voice lowers to a whisper. \u201cAlright. We should be getting close now,\u201d you explain, and he stops in his tracks. \u201cLet\u2019s try to be sneaky about this, alright? See what we\u2019re getting into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d He nods, a determined look on his face. As you approached the camp, you both crouched down to avoid making sound\u2026 and when you drew closer still, you started to crawl along the ground to avoid being seen. Eventually, a bandit encampment came into view exactly where the ninetales had marked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the binoculars out of your bag and give the camp a lookover from your perch in the bushes. \u201cTwo nidoran, a gloom, a skiploom, a roselia, and that roserade he mentioned\u2026\u201d You count out the outlaws, almost holding your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh! Easy peasy!\u201d He smiled. Since most of them are grass types, he figures this must be a piece of cake! But you have your reservations. You desperately want to make sure this goes well. You don\u2019t want to end up gurgling in a stomach on your first mission!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast. We need to come up with a plan\u2026\u201d You tap your chin. \u201cHmm\u2026 that roserade looks like their leader. He\u2019s definitely the toughest. Should we ambush him and see if we can take him out first? Or should we take out his lackies first, so we don\u2019t have to worry about getting attacked from the rear while we fight him?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This has to be one of the best loot we\u2019ve ever stolen\u2026 so worth the heist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 real shame about Mary, though\u2026\u201d The skiploom shivered sadly at the memory. \u201cWhen he caught her, I thought he\u2019d just eat her.

Did that ninetales really\u2026 stuff somebody up his derriere? That would certainly explain why his rump was so huge\u2026 and that squirming belly\u2026 but still, you didn\u2019t even know anything like that was possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Willis still had his eyes on the prize, though, disregarding the banter and creeping up closer. He gestured for you to catch up, and you shook your head, composing yourself and starting to crawl forward again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026?\u201d Eventually, one of the nidoran\u2019s ears perk up, having apparently heard something suspicious. \u201cIs anybody there?\u201d You and Willis stay still as the nidoran approaches the tall grass, looking out for any signs of movement\u2026 and with that, Willis gives the signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two bursts of fire emerge from the bushes, long streams of flame slamming right into the nidoran with enough force to send her flying backwards! Those pillars of flames do a quick sweep across the entire camp, then, immediately stunning all the vulnerable grass-types!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gloom moved forward to counter-attack, Willis lept from the bushes with his claw raised, jumping out from the safety of his cover to him her with a fury swipes attack up close! She goes flying backwards\u2026 but to your shock, a nidoran jumps out behind Willis, about to hit him with her own attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, you reach out from the bushes, grab the nidoran by the sides\u2026 and before she can event react, you jab her into your gaping maw! You let out a wince at feeling your throat stretch so suddenly and so harshly, but you had to get her down before she could even struggle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, you matter to trap the nidoran girl in your big, gurgling belly, and by the chance she had the opportunity to wriggle for freedom, it was too late! You shudder at the feeling\u2026 only to yelp in surprise as you felt a sharp pain go through your side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn with a grunt to see the roserade standing there, pouting! \u201cHey! Stop eating my teammates!\u201d She shouted angrily at you. You felt a nauseous feeling in your gut all of a sudden, but you try to ignore you.

He realized that all of the outlaws were either thoroughly the defeated, or currently wriggling in your gut. With that, he turns to you, the most adorable look of excitement dawning on his face. \u201cOliver\u2026 we did it! We totally kicked their butts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverjoyed at having basically succeeded at your very first mission, he rushed forward and wrapped you in just about the tightest huh ever! Though notably, the moment he came close, your tummy let out a long, rumbling gurgle! \u201cHeh\u2026 you wanna have a bandit feast, don\u2019t you~?\u201d He giggled, looking over the defeated outlaws and licking his lips. You can\u2019t help but nod. The stomach wants what it wants, after all. \u201cAlright, then! To the victors go the spoils!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat other nidoran is sprawled out on the battlefield\u2026 only to feel something wet surrounding her paws. She looks down just in time to watch you slip her entire torso into your gullet! \u201cN-no\u2026 knock that off\u2026!\u201d She gasps in shock, trying futilely to wriggle\u2026 but just moments later, she\u2019s disappeared completely past your lips! \u201cMph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coo at her flavor as she slides over your tongue. before turning into a big, squirming bulge in your throat. You smile, letting it rest there for a while\u2026 before finally taking another gulp, squeezing her into your cramped, gross stomach with her friend, dooming them both to a fate of gurgling into another layer of your soft pudge. Your tongue hangs out as you bask in the utter bliss from the flavor of the duo imprisoned within your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the gloom was shivering beneath Willis as he squished his belly down on top of her\u2026 a belly that was now rapidly being filled with the the roselia! The gloomy seemed understandably upset as that bulge travelled down his throat, and that belly she was trapped under bulged and squirmed as her friend settled into his tight gut. He giggled as he leaned forward, showing off his maw. \u201cYour friend was scrumptious~\u201d He smiled. \u201cCare to join her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were dragging your belly along behind you as you crawled devious after the skiploom, who was waddling away as fast as she could. Not fast enough, though\u2026 as soon, your mouth wrapped around the small Pokemon easily in a single movement, your cheeks bulging out as you ran your tongue over her, savoring your flavor. Soon, you sent her down your gullet to join your other two prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the dazed and recovering roserade was met with the sight of two huge, bulging bellies looming over him! \u201cLooks like this outlaw career - urrrppp - didn\u2019t work out too well for your friends here!\u201d Willis laughed, as the both of you rubbed your hands over your bellies as they noisily digest their prisoners, showing them off. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to say they\u2019ll serve a much better career as our pudge~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 jerks\u2026\u201d The roserade spat viciously at you\u2026 but in response, you both just squished her between your tummies! She groaned as she was squished harshly between those two huge bellies, feeling every movement and hearing the distressed protests of the outlaws inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 what do you think, Oliver?\u201d He asked with a lick of his lips as he grinned down at the roserade you were keeping tightly pinned between your huge, round, gurgling guts, treating her to a cacophony of gurgling and digestion. \u201cShould we take her back to get that extra reward? Or\u2026 well, I gotta admit, I\u2019m a lil tempted to send her to join her pals~\u201d</span></div></div>",

The roserade seems to be relieved, while Willis seemed to be a little disappointed, but he understood your reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yer right. Alright, I\u2019ll her put \u2018er in the bag\u2026\u201d With that, he just easily slid er into the bag the two of you had brought along, along with that big, golden butt sculpture, he hefted it onto his back with a huff, finding it to be super heavy now\u2026 but before he could complain about that, he turned to find you looking queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrrggh\u2026\u201d You were turning a little green, clutching your side as you suddenly felt ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hey, are you alright, buddy?\u201d Willis raised a brow, looking down to see if all the Pokemon in your belly were causing you to feel sick. \u201cDid ya have too much to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d You hunched over a bit, gritting your teeth as a feeling of pure nausea washing over your body like a wave!  \u201cI think she poisoned me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, crap\u2026\u201d He sighed, wrapping an arm around your shoulder to help you not just fall over.  \u201cAlright, c\u2019mon. Let\u2019s get you to a doctor or something\u2026\u201d With that, he stumbled towards town, struggling to keep up both you and his heavy bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like it took absolutely forever to make it back to town\u2026 but when you did, you almost immediately noticed a doctor\u2019s office in the distance. Upon bringing you inside, a big white flower florges behind the counter immediately began wringing her hands with concern at the sorry sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dear! You poor thing! You look terrible\u2026!\u201d She pressed her hands against her cheeks in concern, before ushering you towards a back room without you even having to pay her beforehand. \u201cCome in, come in, please! Right this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillis hesitantly let's go of you to let you walk towards a back room, sitting up on a table while the florges follows along closely behind. \u201cHey, doc\u2026\u201d You stutter, still feeling a growing feeling of pure illness.  \u201cI\u2026 got poisoned\u2026 fighting some bandits out there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how terrible! Here, this should heal you right up,\u201d she frowns, holding up a pecha berry. You quickly start to chow down while she holds your hand, and the berry almost instantly makes you feel better! You coo in delight as she continues. \u201cDid you manage to deal with those bandits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it was no big deal,\u201d you wave a hand, dismissively. \u201cApparently, they had stolen a\u2026 uh, religious relic from that ninetales at the churn here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Sebastian?\u201d She asks, and surprised she knew him, you nod. \u201cOh, him! He runs the strangest little temple! The worst part is, my son\u2019s ran off to join that little \u2018order\u2019 of his\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d You tilt your head, suddenly feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblem is, they\u2019re all dedicated to worshipping that ninetale\u2019s\u2026 derriere!\u201d She shudders. \u201cInitiates at that church only become true members once they, uh\u2026 become part of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, a blush rises on your cheeks as you process her words! Was that what they meant, when they mentioned that ninetales sucking Pokemon up his\u2026 well, behind? \u201cYou mean like\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm\u2026\u201d She nods solemnly, finding the idea much more gross than alluring, unlike you. \u201cIf nobody convinces him to leave that church of his, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s only a matter of time until he\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint, laying a hand against your head, trying to figure this all out. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the guards get involved with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe members of his church all become part of his body voluntarily\u2026 it isn\u2019t a crime to eat willing Pokemon\u2026 even with your behind\u2026\u201d She sighs, before looking up at you. \u201cYou\u2019re a guild member, right? Well, can you see if you can convince my son to leave that terrible church, before it\u2019s too late?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Thank you for the pecha berry!\u201d You give her what little Pokes it was worth, before trotting back out to find Willis sitting on that bag, taking a break, while the roserade protests. You smile, patting that big round gut of his, feeling the bandits squirming about within. With a big meal like that, it\u2019ll take a few hours for em to stop fighting the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeelin\u2019 better, Oliver?\u201d He smiles, standing up and wrapping you in a tight hug, letting both of your engorged, grumbling bellies squish and compact together as you nuzzle one another. \u201cAlright! I think I found this church of Sebastian\u2019s on the map. Let\u2019s head over there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you follow along towards the church, you can\u2019t really get your mind off everything you\u2019ve been told. You can\u2019t tell if Willis is just oblivious to it all, or completely indifferent. Were you just overreacting? It\u2019s like you just couldn\u2019t get the image of that ninetale\u2019s tush out of your mind for some reason\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re a little surprised when you finally come across that little church. You half-expected it to look like a giant butt or something, but really, it resembled a regular, quaint small church, if ninetales-themed. There was a name above the entrance, but it must\u2019ve been written in another language or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you neared, you were surprised by the sight of the ninetales trotting right out, as if knowing you were there somehow! \u201cWelcome, my darlings, to my humble little order!\u201d He smiled. This time, you didn\u2019t even mind that he called you \u2018darling\u2019. \u201cI\u2019m sure those outlaws were no match at all for such big, strong explorers~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, getting more than a little blushy and flustered at his flattery. \u201cU-uuuuh\u2026 no sir! Easy peasy! We\u2019ve got them all right here!\u201d You give a sheepish smile as you slap your belly with your paw, rousing all the Pokemon trapped inside and revealing their bulging movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe! Wonderful! Just where they belong~\u201d He chuckles, and you blush harder as he reaches out to rub your engorged belly, enjoying feeling the outlaws wriggling within. \u201cAnd what of the sculpture and the roserade, hmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here!\u201d Willis was relieved to finally be able to turn over and empty out the leather bag, with the big golden sculpture, as well as the tied up and gagged roserade, flopping out on the ground. With a chuckle, the ninetales collects them with his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLovely! You boys have done wonderfully! Have your payment, for services rendered~\u201d He smiles, as he tossed over a big bag of coins. \u201cAnd of course, a bonus for the roserade!\u201d He smiled as he reached out and handed you a Stealth Scarf! You marvelled as you gazed down at it, finding it all blue and black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, thank you!\u201d You nod excitedly as you slide the scarf on, already feeling a new power filling you. With that, it seemed the ninetales was going to retreat back into his church\u2026 but he paused, his huge, round, perfect rump angled at you as he stood faced away from you. \u201cOh, yes. By the by, you darlings wouldn\u2019t happen to want to see around my church, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillis was a little incredulous about this whole church thing from the beginning, so he shook his head. \u201cNah. I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you, darling?\u201d You bite your lip as Sebastian turns to you, his beautiful, piercing eyes gazing right into your\u2019s. Willis didn\u2019t seem to understand, but you couldn\u2019t help but be tempted by the thought, suspicious as this church may be...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re going with this guy\u2026?\u201d Willis tilts his head, his tail flicking behind him, seeming rather surprised that you\u2019d just want to run off with some random ninetales into a creepy church. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, man\u2026\u201d You sheepishly shrug, not even sure how to describe what you\u2019re feeling. \u201cI wanna\u2026 befriend the citizens around here, you know? Isn\u2019t that part of my duty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 okay,\u201d he said. He obviously seemed concerned that it would turn out that this ninetales was some sort of predator, trying to lure you on your own. \u201cJust\u2026 make sure he doesn\u2019t try anything funny, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to worry! I shall make sure no harm befalls your friend here,\u201d Sebastian smiled, his fluffy side sliding along your back as he curls up halfway around you, nuzzling you close. \u201cSo, shall we, darling? I can make things comfy for you in the temple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as you nod, and Willis can only stand there and watch incredulously as the huge-rumped ninetales leads you away in the temple. Figuring that it was up to fate now, the charmeleon could just stumble off, grumbling to himself. Meanwhile, you were surprised by how beautiful and ornate it was in this little temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a beautiful place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sebastian smiled, walking forward and placing the big, golden butt statue back in its rightful place\u2026 before dropping that outlaw on the ground before him.  \u201cI shall show you around, as soon as I am finished with this miscreant. Sound alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart immediately starts pumping in your chest as he looms over her. Was he really going to\u2026? \u201cMm. Good evening, thief. You seem to have found yourself in quite a predicament, haven\u2019t you?\u201d He teased, the roserade looking rather bummed as the ninetales glowing eyes shined down on her. \u201cAll bound up with no one to rescue you. Well, no worries, darling. You are sure to enjoy what comes next, trust me~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe taps his chin, as if contemplating. \u201cOne question still bothers me - why would you go and steal such a strange sculpture? It cost me so much to create\u2026 and it\u2019s not like you could pawn it off anywhere\u2026\u201d He asks, looking back at the strange butt-shaped statue. \u201cThough\u2026 you didn\u2019t steal it for the money, did you? No\u2026 I think it was pure admiration~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush only deepened when he turned around, letting his massive rump loom over her, each of his jiggly cheeks bigger than her entire body! \u201cWell, if my rush was what you were wanting, why didn\u2019t ya just go for the real thing~?\u201d She blushes too at the sight, wide-eyed at the perfect rump\u2026 only for it to plop right down on her! \u201cAh\u2026 there you go. Is it just like you imagined?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his lip, grinding that squishy, soft rump down on her for a while. She wasn\u2019t struggling at all\u2026 it must be absolutely bliss, up inbetween those huge, soft cheeks. Your face was all red as you tried to convince yourself you weren\u2019t jealous of her. To your surprise, when he eventually stood up, she was plastered against his rump\u2026 with her head buried between deep those thick cheeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaah\u2026 there we go! It seems like she\u2019s going to fit back there, with a little effort!\u201d A shiver spread over your entire body as he wriggled that huge, powerful, dangerous rump in your direction.  \u201cYou. Oliver, darling. Would you mind giving me a hand with this? It can be quite a daunting task with someone her size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uhh\u2026\u201d You stutter, wide-eyed. Your heart felt like it was about to pump out of your chest, and yet, somehow, you still felt compelled by his words to step forward. \u201cO\u2026 okay\u2026\u201d You gasp quietly as you place your paws on each of his cheeks, feeling just how SOFT they were. How soft must it be between them\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust grab her by the waist and held to slide her forward. My rump shall do the rest.\u201d Once again, you were stunned at the mere thought of what he was asking you to do\u2026 but still, your body moves almost on its own, compelling you to follow his instructions. His whole body tenses up as you reach forward and push her more into his rump with surprising ease! \u201cAaaah\u2026 that hits the spot\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in awe at the power of that ass! Your jaw hanging open as you managed to slide her easily into the dark canyon between those cheeks with every minor push. \u201cMmm\u2026 just a little more darling!\u201d He panted once she was halfway in. \u201cGet her firmly in there, and my derriere will be able to handle the rest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, once her legs were dangling out, you could just let go\u2026 and watch in awe as gravity slid them right into his ass on its own. You could only watch as that tailhole slid closed, as if nothing had happened, sealing the roserade to her fate. She hadn\u2019t even struggled. \u201cOooh! Mmph! Ah~ Here she goes! Aaaah\u2026 mmm\u2026 all tucked away. See? Easier than you imagined, I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d You felt like you were about to faint as he stood up, relaxing with a dopey expression on his face, looking over his shoulder and batting those long eyelashes at you as he swayed that big, fat rump. \u201cHow did you\u2026 do that\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch practice, my dear. Dozens of Pokemon have likely added to that rump you\u2019re admiring,\u201d he said, and you did a double-take. \u201cPokemon are naturally stretchy, darling. If you experiment, I think you\u2019ll find you\u2019re capable of swallowing Pokemon with more than just your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026\u201d You stutter. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t play coy! I saw the awe on your face. You know exactly why.\u201d He smiled, showing off his rump as he paced around the room, the roserade settling in his belly as he gave his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is only the natural way of things, for Pokemon to become part of other Pokemon. It\u2019s going to happen to all of us one day\u2026 all of our lives leading up to the moment another decides to add us to their hips. Most prey are a casual snack, gulped down and completely forgotten, their name fading into the annals of history, a layer of pudge being their own memory\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will say it plainly; my followers come to me because they want to be part of my derriere. It\u2019s a strange wish, you might think\u2026 but you can\u2019t judge someone for wanting to become part of something much larger than themselves. Physically and figuratively\u2026 hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy followers come to me for a variety of reasons. Some have had loved ones become fat on my rump, and they want to join them. Some are interested because it\u2019s a more rare and novel way to go than merely being swallowed. And I confess, many come to me purely for the\u2026 erotic aspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am a noble predator. I remember each and every one of the followers I\u2019ve turned into pudge on my rump, and leading up to them becoming part of me, I spend upwards of weeks with them everyday, caring for and speaking with them. What more could someone ask for in a predator?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were completely silent, stunned after all that information, and he only giggled. \u201cI understand I\u2019m dropping a lot of information on you, sugar. Don\u2019t worry about it too much, ultimately. This church will be gone soon, after all,\u201d he smiled, leaning in close. \u201cNow, after that spiel\u2026 why don\u2019t we enjoy some tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were sitting at a small table with him, enjoying cups of tea he poured. At least, you were supposed to. All you could really do was sit there thinking about everything you had learned\u2026 and whether you wanted to go talk to that florge\u2019s son, or even continue messing with this cult at all...</span></div></div>",

Leave this little\u2026 church thing.\u201d In response, he just sort of sighs, looking glumly down at the ornate wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to make her understand what Sebastian is trying to do here\u2026\u201d He sadly shakes his head. \u201cI feel for my mother, I really do! But she doesn\u2019t understand that some Pokemon just don\u2019t want to go on and live full, ambitious lives like her. Some Pokemon were just meant to become pudge. Why not get it over with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d You look at him with concern, although deep down, you completely understand his reluctance. \u201cSo\u2026 there\u2019s really not anything else you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already fulfilled my life\u2019s purpose. Now, all I want is to become part of something larger\u2026\u201d He says, the dedication in his voice making it obvious it\u2019d be impossible to change his mind. \u201cShe must have sent you because the Reunion is tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, uncomprehending.\u201cThe what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the big ritual that\u2019ll signal the end of his church. To put it plainly\u2026 Sebastian plans to give every one of his current followers a choice,\u201d he explains. \u201cEither leave, or become part of his rump. Those that stay shall be churned up into fat on his rump, all at the same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the redness returning to your cheeks, imagining the ninetales shoving every single Pokemon in this church up his rump at the same time. Was the even possible? And\u2026 how big would his rump get afterwards? \u201cWhy would he want to end the church\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe says he wants to go out and adventure. Help Pokemon across Zaplana, not just in Juniper Town,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBesides, people around here have been calling this church a cult\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit in silence for a while, before he turns to you. \u201cListen, I won\u2019t leave the church. I want to become part of Sebastian,\u201d he concludes. \u201cBut I really visit my mother tonight, for one last goodbye. Hopefully, that will make her feel better about all this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 guess it\u2019s as good a compromise as any,\u201d you shrug weakly, before trotting off to go your separate ways. Really, as you try and figure out everything you\u2019ve been told, you slowly come to realize you had two options. Option A - probably the smarter choice - was to just leave this church and forget about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B was to attend this \u2018Reunion\u2019 yourself, and help the ninetales with that\u2026 impressive task. You\u2019d take Willis along so he can see what the ninetales is capable of\u2026 with this, after all, seeing is believing. You didn\u2019t know why you\u2019d even go with this option\u2026 other than that seeing such a ritual would surely be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, if ever there\u2019s been one...</span></div></div>",

You desperately wanted to go back to sleep, but the sun was directly in your eyes, and you couldn't. You took a moment to rub your eyes, before you remembered something important. Today was your first day as a member of Juniper Town's guild! You sprang out of bed, quickly gathered your things, and headed to the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Maxwell, a young Zorua who has always dreamed of being a famous explorer. You've been trying to join the guild for nearly a year now, but the guild is very strict on it's age requirement. But you've still been preparing yourself for a life of adventure, practicing your moves, exploring the small dungeons just outside of town, and of course, gobbling up as many small Pokemon as you could. Just last week, after your birthday, you applied to the guild, and last night, they invited you in! How exciting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts were running through your head as you made your way to the dining hall. It was almost time for breakfast, and then you would get to meet your mentor and teammates! The smell of food snapped you out of it however, and you hurried to the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered, you were in awe at how just how many Pokemon were here, you could see at least two dozen from the door, and there were surely more besides! You saw tons of strong looking pokemon, happily chatting to each other, and stuffing themselves on the huge amount of food available. There were even a couple whose bellies were wiggling. There must have been some volunteers, or captured outlaws, you concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished looking around the room, your eyes quickly found their way to the breakfast line. Your rumbling stomach told you it wasn't willing to wait any longer, so you got in line. You grabbed a plate, and piled it high with a variety of different breakfast foods. Pancakes, toast, eggs, omelettes, a little bit of everything found it's way onto your plate. You then placed the plate on your back with practiced ease, and began looking for a place to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to look long however, as you quickly spotted an Eevee flagging you down. You didn't recognize her, but she certainly seemed excited to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you the new kid? I'm Marisu! I think we are going to be on the same team!\" She said without pausing for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I'm Maxwell. I just joined last night.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! We have so much to talk about.\" She launched into a series of seemingly random questions. What your favorite color was, what your favorite food was, etc... While she continued to ask questions, you simply sat down and began to inhale your breakfast, only pausing to breathe every now and again. This continued for a little while before a loud noise caught you attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

And they needed her in her highest spirits possible to start the day off right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny jackall Pokemon descended down the many stairs of the massive ship into the lowest section of the Oygia. It was dark and poorly lit, and something always had to be repaired as the wood was rotten and soggy. In the farthest end of the stern lied the ship\u2019s Lazarette, which doubled as the captain\u2019s quarters. With a heavy inhale of breath, the Riolu pushed the heavy, double doors and entered the sanctum of their guild leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had thought after seeing her so many times, he would get used to her appearance. But every time he opened the door to Captain Calypso's Lazarette, he was utterly blown away by how immense she was. The room was lavishly decorated with pretty little things that sparkled, a worthy collection gathered from their exploits on the high seas. In the middle of the room was an open body of water, and in that body of water was the Milotic called Calypso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic and obese serpent Pokemon smiled down at her favorite cabin boy as he took in the sheer excess of her frame. Years of dealing out due punishment on the scum of the waves had left her more than well fed. Her body was so huge and so powerful, she acted as her ship\u2019s own rudder, moving the gigantic structure that housed her guild with ease and speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Calypso!\u201d The small Riolu gave his captain a proper salute, always a little on edge in her presence. No because she was scary to him, quite the opposite! The little jackal thought she looked stunning, which made him feel rather weird and unsure of himself. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at Juniper Town, thank you for guiding us a safe journey once again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d Calypso opened her mouth to speak, an angelic and soothing feminine voice erupting out as she slithered her body towards the her diminutive employee. She pressed her lardy snout into his chest in an affectionate nuzzle, putting a reluctant smile on the Riolu\u2019s face. \u201cYou are quite welcome, my little one. Now, if you would please, may you set up the preparations for my sunrise speech?\u201d She batted her eyelids at him, her sparkling eyes calming his soul and putting him a state of tranquility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMph, of course Captain Calypso!\u201d The Little Riolu saluted once again, this time with genuine enthusiasm, and ran out of the Lazarette to tell the crew their new orders. Calypso smiled and sank beneath the waves of her ship, swimming out of her quarters and into the harbor of a Juniper Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the sun had come up, and the Pok\u00e9mon of Juniper Town had gathered around the dock. The Pok\u00e9mon Guild was here! They were saved! The crew of the Oygia made way for their captain\u2019s Cabin Boy as the Riolu climbed up the stairs to a makeshift stage. \u201cPeople of Juniper Town!\u201d He yelled out as far as his little lungs would let him. \u201cGive a round of cheer for our captain, Calypso!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waters behind the makeshift stage parted to reveal a massive, stunning Milotic around the size of her own ship. The morning sun\u2019s light bounced off spectacularly from her fat scales, making her gleam with color and shine. The crowd around the dock erupted into applause at the little light show, and Calypso gave out a warm smile as she reached herself for her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy fellow Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d she began with a calm tone. \u201cThank you all so much for being patient with us. We are sorry that we did not come sooner in your time if need. Now, however, we are here, and we are here to help. I promise you all, this town will once again be known for it\u2019s beautiful flowers and crops, and the culprit behind this drought will be brought to justice!\u201d Her little speech ended in a big finish after rising tempo, the Milotic shaking her expansive form to emphasize the punishment that the culprit will receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crows once again bursted Into cheer, this time much more loud. All was good now, as long as the Oygia stayed in their docks. After some fanfare, the crowd dispersed back into Juniper Town, and exploration teams began teaming the streets, looking for ways that they can help. Calypso smiled at the affair play out, happy that she could be of help\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and that her belly would soon be full of delicious troublemakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Calypso\u2019s first order of business?</span></div></div>",

She was already anticipating them helping out the residents of this town, and anticipating them getting her a few snacks. However, she figured she had some time to kill before they did their thing. And she knew a certain someone to kill that time with~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Riolu was left on the ship while the rest of the crew was unloading, him tasked with tending to the ship's stations and making sure they're in good shape. He held a bucket of water in one hand, and a washcloth in the other. Some believed he'd eventually build some muscle and get himself ready for the real battlefield. But, for now, he could only clean. At least, until Calypso poked her head over the side of the side of the ship, a soft smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst~\" she whispered out. The Riolu's sensitive ears caught her voice, and looked over. At that, he lowered his washcloth, tapped his indices together, and approached her, feeling that same unsure feeling fill his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Captain Calypso,\" he said, a nervous edge to his voice. Her beautiful smile didn't ease him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deeply appreciate your work up here, but before you continue with this, I think you deserve a break,\" Calypso said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... break?\" the cabin boy questioned, tilting his head like a confused canine. Sure, he practically just started, but if this captain were offering... \"Th-thank you ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you spend that break down with me?\" The cabin boy's ears stiffened at her suggestion, and he felt his legs quake underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-with you...?\" he parroted. Calypso nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'm going to be alone while the rest of the crew are working off the ship. I think a little company will help make the time fly by.\" Calypso batted her eyes at him, filling the cabin boy's stomach with butterflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, ma'am!\" he answered sharply. At that, he set down his washcloth and ran down the ship, right towards the cabin. In the meantime, Calypso swam over to the back of the ship, sliding in to her cabin and waiting for the boy. Soon, the  Lazarette doors opened up, though Calypso couldn't help but notice a pause between the sound of his footsteps and when he started pushing the doors. He approached, hands clasped tightly around each other, as he approached the edge, the immense Milotic's face near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this, dear~\" she cooed out, causing the Riolu to look away while he rung his fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, captain...\" he said, cautiously looking upon her face. He stood there for a while, the captain simply eyeing him up for a while, contemplating how to play with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massive and fat sea serpent smiled possessively over her cute little Cabin Boy as she slithered her expansive form across the wooden floor of her Lazarette. The old oak creaked ominously under her impossible weight, making the Riolu give out a frightened cry as he backed away slowly from the encroaching captain. Calypso giggled daintily as she observed him stumble back into the heavy doors as she closed the distance between them. \"Don't tell me you're afraid, my little employee.\" She purred as she gently smooshed her light muzzle into his form, making him blush. \"You couldn't possibly think you're in danger with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu Cabin Boy let out a small whine as his captain warmed his body. \"S-sorry, Captain Calypso...\" He offered, cautiously placing his small paws on the muzzle of the Mioltic in a slow hug. \"It's just that...you're so big, and I'm so small...\". Despite his underlying fear, he felt strangely placid in the presence of the great Pokemon. He owed his life to her, or so the crew of the Oygia had explained to him. The story went that he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck and that Calypso managed to save him before drowning in the water when he was so young. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...true. I have to be one of the biggest Pok\u00e9mon in the whole wide world, and you have to be one of the smallest.\" She playfully teased, making him red under his fur. Suddenly, Calypso raised her head over so slightly so that she may pucker her lips and envelop the small Pokemon's body in a loving kiss! The kiss lasted around ten seconds before she released him, leaving him dazed with a happy grin on his face. \"But That doesn't mean I can't play with my favorite Riolu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu's heart fluttered and his stomach swelled with butterflies as he recovered from the kiss. Why did he feel so strange? His legs felt like gelatin and he found himself leaning onto his captain for support, only making her smile widen. \"...um, could you...uh...do that again, please?\" Riolu practically begged as he stared into the Milotic's dazzling eyes. The big snake purred again and obliged his request, smothering him in another kiss that took his breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu was so caught up with the big smooch that he was receiving that he didn't realize that he was being slurped up into her maw! He didn't know what was happening until it was too late, his little paws kicking the air as she slurped them last her lips like noodles. \"Wah!\" He cried out in fear as his world was plunged in darkness. \"Ca-captain Calypso, what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalypso didn't answer, she was too busy enjoying the delicious flavor that her Cabin Boy provided. She rolled her head on pleasure as her tongue carefully swisher over his flailing body, so sweet and nice, soft and wiggly. The Milotic suckled down on his body as she chewed him between her toothless gums as if he was a lollipop or a piece of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my Cabin Boy...\" The Milotic swooned as she tossed the Riolu in her slimy maw to one side of her cheeks to speak. \"Oh, you have to be the tastiest thing I've ever had...ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ca-Calypso...\" The terrified Riolu stammered as he cuddled up to the Milotic's cheek for warmth, making a squirming bulge appear on her fat. \"Are you gonna...eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my poor sweet Riolu, no...\" Calypso breathed as she gently rolled her serpentine tongue over his body, trying to comfort him. \"No, I would never eat you. You're too tasty a sweetie pie to ever leave this world. I'm so sorry I scared you, but it's not so bad being my lollipop, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu shivered as the big tongue slathered goopy saliva all over his form. Although he was still greatly unnerved about what had just happened...it wasn't all too bad, when he thought about it. He had no reason to doubt Calypso's word, she had never lied to him before, so he no longer felt like he was in danger of being her food. The maw of the serpent was warm and kind of soft, and the slimy saliva acted as a sort of blanket...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...it is a little fun in here...\" The Riolu relented, having trouble believing his own words. \"So, um...can I come out, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...no, my Riolu.\" She let out in pleasure as she began to slither her way back towards the water, making her occupant freak out a little. \"You've always been telling me that you wanted to go on a mission of yourself, right? Well, think of this as your first mission. You are coming with me so we can help the people of Juniper Town back to their former glory.\" Ignoring the stifled protests the Riolu gave out, the great Milotic plunged herself underneath the waves, clamping her mouth shut so no water would come in her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu Cabin Boy tired to be pouty about the situation, but he couldn't help but feel excited. He was going to spend the whole day helping people along with Calypso! Maybe he could learn some pointers on how to be big and strong, or get to go on a real mission! Calypso smiled as she felt the little Pokemon inside her maw squirm in delight as he thought of what was going to happen in the day. Such a cute little thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalypso docked herself along the beach of Juniper Town's harbor as she deposited her little Riolu gently in the shallow water to clean off. The little jackall let out a cry of shock as the cold water shook him out of his fantasies, but at the same time, it invigorated him for what was to come in the day later. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Despite the fact that there's a ton of vorish Pokemon interactives, I've always been bummed out by the fact that I couldn't find any about Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, a spinoff series that's always fascinated me even more than the main series. There's been PMD-themed routes in other interactives, but I can't find any that are completely focused on PMD related shenanigans. So, it seems my only choice is to make one myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/greaterthan.png\" alt=\"*GreaterThan*\" title=\"GreaterThan\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>How the World Works:</b> In case you don't know, the world of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is inhabited entirely by Pokemon! That means no anthros, no humans, no animals, no digimon, and no fakemon. While the main focus is on stuffing, weight gain, and vore and such, all sorts of other kinks can also be experienced throughout the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/greaterthan.png\" alt=\"*GreaterThan*\" title=\"GreaterThan\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>How Eating Works:</b> Have you ever seen how massive the average berry is in the Pokemon universe? Needless to say, every food item in this interactive will be weirdly huge, and the average meal will lead Pokemon to having at least big, round, full-looking bellies. However, their metabolisms are designed to compensate for this, so just stuffing yourself normally won't lead to any weight gain. If you REALLY stuff yourself silly, though, you'll experience some pretty rapid weight gain, able to earn pounds and pounds of pudge over the course of a single day! You lose weight just as easily, though, and there are upper limits; it's impossible to become a big, unrecognizable blob of fat or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/greaterthan.png\" alt=\"*GreaterThan*\" title=\"GreaterThan\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <b>How Vore Works:</b> Every Pokemon has naturally stretchy throats and stomachs in order to hold all that food, which has the side effect of allowing them to swallow other Pokemon! This is a skill that will have to be trained. At first, swallowing prey will give you a sore throat and a terrible tummyache, and digestion will take all day! Experienced preds, however, will be able to swallow and gurgle prey with scary ease! With some effort and training, other forms of vore might also be possible, but much more difficult. There is currently no known method of safe vore or reformation; however, preds have a window of time they can spit their prey out before digestion begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\" style=\"padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;\"><div align=\"left\" style=\"padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;\"><a class=\"blue2roll\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/polls/item_id/2184497\" target=\"_top\">Vore Gender Poll</a>\u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/polls/item_id/2184497\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></div>Which kind of vore do you prefer the most?</div><div class=\"\" align=\"center\"><table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\"><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Female Pred, Male Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"88\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>360</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>43.8%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Male Pred, Male Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"56\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>228</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>27.8%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Female Pred, Female Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"38\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>160</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>19.5%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\">Male Pred, Female Prey</div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" width=\"200\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" align=\"left\"><div style=\"padding-left:3px;\"><img src=\"/imgs/dot-red.gif\" height=\"16\" width=\"18\"></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"45\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div style=\"padding:3px;\"><b>73</b><br><small>Votes</small></div></td><td class=\"mainLineBorderBottom\" align=\"center\" width=\"50\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"><div align=\"center\" style=\"padding:3px;padding-left:4px;padding-right:4px;\"><b>8.9%</b></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" class=\"norm\"><div style=\"padding:6px;\"><b>Total Votes:</b></div></td><td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" class=\"norm\"><div style=\"padding:6px;\"><b>821</b></div></td><td width=\"50\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" class=\"norm\"><div style=\"padding:6px;\"><b>100%</b></div></td></tr></table></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I reserve the right to edit or delete chapters in this story as I see fit.</b></td>",
