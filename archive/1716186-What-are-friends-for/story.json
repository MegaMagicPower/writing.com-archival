It has been this way ever since you broke up with your girlfriend a few weeks ago. It\u2019s always the same, you meet a girl, think she is the one, you\u2019re on top of the world and then they go nuts and you end up alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear your phone ringing; you casually answer it to hear your best friend Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s over.\u201d He says, \u201cWait what\u2019s over?\u201d I ask, \u201cMe and Shawna.\u201d He says, \u201cOh no man what happened.\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there is a knock on my front door, \u201cHang on one second man.\u201d I say walking to the door, looking through the peep hole and seeing that it is Will. \u201cCome on let me in and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh softly and open the door giving him a quick hug and inviting him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we broke up a few days ago and this was the first time I\u2019ve felt like doing anything.\u201d He says, \u201cOh man, I was wondering why you\u2019d been so quiet this week.\u201d I say as I sit back in my chair and he sits on the couch. \u201cBeer?\u201d I say offering him one from the cooler I had beside the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be awesome,\u201d he says, I then hand him one and we both lay back in our seats. \u201cSo I guess you\u2019re not doing anything tonight either?\u201d he asks, \u201cNope, you know after I break up with or get dumped by a girl I don\u2019t have a social life for at least a month.\u201d I say barely exaggerating <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then cracks a smile, \u201cYeah your luck is almost as bad as mine.\u201d He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow yeah if we\u2019re going to talk about women I\u2019m going to need a stronger drink.\u201d I say finishing my beer and getting up to the kitchen, moments later returning with a bottle of tequila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, you brought out the good stuff.\u201d He says sitting up as I bring out two shot glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us then begin to drink, going through our entire relationship histories and wondering why each of them went wrong. And what was wrong with women in general. Before long half the bottle was already gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know man I don\u2019t know why pretty much every woman you have ever talked to seemed to think that you\u2019re a cocky idiot. You\u2019re the most awesome guy I know.\u201d I say laughing, \u201cYeah! I am awesome, you hear the Shawna!\u201d he says standing up proudly, \u201cAnd Becky\u2026 and Kate\u2026 and Tina\u2026\u201d he says falling back down on the couch laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then began laughing as well thinking about all the women that have told him pretty much the same thing, \u201cMan I don\u2019t know how you pick them but they all seem to go crazy eventually.\u201d I say taking another shot, \u201cYeah I guess it\u2019s just my luck,\u201d he says taking two shots to catch up with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh that\u2019s good stuff.\u201d He says, \u201cBut yea what I really need is a girl I can just chill with like this, that settles it, man you need to be a girl.\u201d He says laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the alcohol I then burst out laughing regardless of how odd the statement was. \u201cOh yeah that would solve everything, but remember Shawna looked a whole lot better in a bikini.\u201d I say laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then takes a moment to remember how hot she was but quickly snapping out of it because it reminded him that he just lost her, \u201cYeah but that\u2019s why you would be way hotter.\u201d He says<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\" i say laughing at the through, \"Do tell, what do you have in mind for female me?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you would have curly blonde hair, about shoulder length, and it should smell like spring time\u2026\u201d he says with a goofy smile as he takes another drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright now let\u2019s talk about body shape; wide hips, nice round ass, but overall athletic, some toned muscles, flat stomach, soft to the touch but not fat\u2026\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to laugh at the thought of a flat stomach as you look down at yours, which was not so flat like it could be, maybe too much beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay now I know I might regret this but what kind of clothes would I wear?

I mean you would own some dresses, and skirts instead of your suits, but you could still wear jeans, though they would be girl jeans so they would be a little tighter,\u201d he says laughing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it would be whatever you want cause female you would have plenty of money to spend on clothes.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, sounds like female me would be living better then I am,\u201d I say since currently I haven\u2019t bought new clothes in years; then again men don\u2019t need new clothes that often, \u201cOkay so where is all this money to spare coming from?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell female you would have a way better job then you; instead of slaving away as a nameless cubical filler, she could be like your bosses executive assistant or something.\u201d He says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd at the end of the day we will be able to just hang out like this?\u201d I asked to complete his idea and he confirmed. \u201cYeah, and you would even be able to drink like this, cause you know women usually don\u2019t have any tolerance for alcohol\u201d he says laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of heavy drinking, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d You say as you head to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned you see that Will has passed out on the couch, so you head upstairs and pass out in the bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wearing women's clothes was nothing you were looking forward to. While you were always pleased to see tight revealing clothing on women while you were a guy, now that you were a woman yourself, wearing clothing designed you show off your own curves seemed daunting. You headed to a women's department store that you knew had personalized shoppers. You gave the lady there the name Sophie and a fake story about how your home caught fire and now you needed a new wardrobe. She seemed to light up at the project and asked for your sizes. Not knowing what to tell her, you said \"You might as well take my measurements here, some of my old bras didn't fit right anyways.\" The lady pulled out a tape measure and started wrapping it around you in places you had no idea women had to have measured. She asked if you had any preferences and you told her to grab whatever, which you realized may have been a mistake. You went into the dressing room and the saleslady returned with a full basket of lingerie. She told you to try everything on and let her know what you liked when you were done. She outdid herself when you realized that she came back with panties of every cut and color, multiple types of bras to match various sets of the underwear, hosiery, and some interesting pieces that you may have to ask for help on wearing. You settled on a grey pair of panties and the matching bra, \"May as well get this over with,\" as you slide them up your legs. Here you were, a man two days ago, and now you're wearing panties. Once you got over the psychological aspect of how feminine even the name for this underwear was, you had to admit, they were actually pretty comfortable. You took a couple tries getting the bra on, but once you did you turned to the mirror and admired your reflection for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vFOAms5.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/vFOAms5.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is actually not bad at all.\" you thought as you turned to the other underwear. You got the full experience in all cuts of panties, even thongs, which while unusual, were not the dreaded nightmare you thought they'd be. You decided to get 2 weeks worth, every cut just to see the experience, and stuck mostly to white and black colors. You figured some blue wouldn't be too feminine, as unfeminine as bras and panties could be at least, but you even surprised yourself when you picked out both a pink and a purple set as well. You couldn't stop admiring how they looked on this body and it almost seemed a waste to not see it dressed in the underwear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fpkRUK1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/fpkRUK1.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/qRJbT0r.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/qRJbT0r.jpg</a><br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou put the grey set back and called the saleslady back, \"I'll take those ones you pointed to the pile you set aside, \"And I'd like to wear these out if I can.\" She smiled and said it was no problem, and that she was ready for you to try on clothes now. </span></div></div>",

She's tiny! You're lucky you got your build from your dad. So the female you would be a petite thing with just those small curves, ya know?\" he noted stubbornly before trailing off on his thoughts a bit. \"Big tits and asses on tiny girls just look wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" I filled another shot as i tried to picture it. Will wasn't wrong, but it was crazy to consider. He'd always been a pretty tall, decently built guy, but if he'd taken after his mom's genes instead things could have been pretty different. \"I guess I can see that. I'm surprised you'd be interested in that, didn't think the small girls were your type. It was always athletes and bombshells...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never really tried it out before,\" he muttered before taking a shot and hissed slightly at the burn. He sighed looking a bit wistful. \"It would nice to have a girl that needs me, ya know... someone to hold.\" he offered a crooked smile. \"And if it was you I'd know I could count on you if I need the support...\" the alcohol must really be getting to him was starting to get mushy, best bring it back to the silly thought experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you think if you made me into a short girl I'd just be swayed by your hugeness and swoon in your arms.\" I teased with a smirk getting a chuckle out of him. \"Short girls get get by just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even to get to the top shelves?\" he shot back jovially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what step stools are for.\" I fired back immediately before taking my own shot. Will let out a good laugh out of him. That's what i wanted to hear. As stupid as this was it at least seemed to be cheering him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl with some spunk, I can dig that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anything else about this dream me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some nice blond ha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're NOT turning me into a Blond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on you asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's no way female me would go blond. I like my hair color, Brunette all the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph I guess you would look weird if you got a dye job.\" he smirked picturing it. \"But it would need to be long, I wouldn't budge on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I guess long hair is fine.\" I shrugged, Long hair could be a pain to take care of but will wasn't the only one with a thing for long haired girls. \"That all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... the important thing is you'd still be you. Just in a smaller, cuter package.\" he leaned back on the couch and we both fell into a companionable silence as we finished out drinks. More drinks flowed as the topic switched to more of the mundane day to day fair... Before long the bottle was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man...\" he said suddenly as he but the empty glass down. \"I know this was silly but it was nice to get my mind of things for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Dude,\" I clasped him lightly on the back, leaving my hand on his shoulder for a moment. \"I'm sure the right girl is out there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so...\" he sighed and stood a little wobbly. \"I really should get going. where did I put my keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no,\" I should up and stood between him in the door. \"Not like that, you take the couch tonight. Neither of us are in the state to go anywhere.\" I held firm and he slowly stumbled back until he fell back to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" he grumbled. I retrieved one of the spare blankets and pillows but even before I could return he'd passed out sitting up. He had the right idea. tossing the pillow aside I covered Will in the Blanket turned of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...G'night Will.\" there was no reply aside from his soft breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumbled over to my bed room clumsily tossing aside my pants and socks but not even bothering with my shirt. Face-planting awkwardly into the bed, one foot still hanging off the bed. I shifted myself only enough to get under the blanket and pulled the closest pillow toward me before sleep claimed me as well...</span></div></div>",

As much as I wanted to just close eyes and pass back out a pressure on my bladder forced me to get up. I flailed awkwardly to free myself from the tangle of heavy blankets. After a short struggle I managed to get myself over to the edge and stretched. I slide forward and didn't feel anything for a moment before my bare feet hit carpet, the delay causing me to stumble a little and catch myself on the night stand. Boxers caught on my ankles, annoyed i kicked them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid things...\" I muttered sourly, clearing my throat a bit. My throat was dry as a bone, but for some reason my voice sounded off. I shook my head cursing as my vision was blocked by hair. I pushed it aside roughly, and froze. My hair is not long enough to get into my eyes. I looked down to the long locks in my hand. It was the same light brown but there was so much of it... it was well past my shoulders. I tugged slightly and felt the pressure on my scalp. \"No fucking way...\" I whispered the twittering in my stomach somewhere between awe and fear. \"Mirror. I need a mirror.\" I stumble toward the open door way and rushed to the bathroom. Panic seized my chest as everything seemed off around me, tables and doorknobs all higher then they should.  Charging into the bathroom I put my hands onto the counter, and looked at my reflection... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA petite girl dressed in an over-sized t-shirt peeked over the edge of the counter back at me. The neck hole of her shirt sitting crookedly revealing one slender shoulder and small peek at the modest bust just beneath it. Her delicate features were twisted in a an expression somewhere between awe and fear, all framed by a cascade of brown hair that disappeared down her back. I shakily reached out my hand, smaller and daintier then it should be, finger tips touching the mirror just as the girl did. It was my reflection...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\"</span></div></div>",

It was hard to tell though with only half my torso visible over her counter. I hopped up trying to get a better look, all I managed to do was further offset my over-sized tee-shirt. \"Damn it.\" I cursed softly in my unfamiliar voice... I needed a full view and this was the only mirror in the house. There had to be a chair or somethi- \"The step stool.\" I rushed back into the hallway, hangover long forgotten in the rush of it all. Far in the back of the broom closet was an old plastic step stool, about little over 10 inches tall. I'd only ever needed to use it like twice the entire time I'd lived here but i was more then thankful now. Lugging it out of the closet and all the way back to the bathroom I placed it steady against the counter and climbed up. This was much closer to the view I was used to seeing... height wise at least, still a little off but it would do. With a moment to prepare myself I took off the tee shirt and tossed it to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I was definitely a woman. There was was something definitely missing down below,  In it's place was a slit I'd seen on my partners in the past. Apparently I shaved as well as the hair above it was neatly trimmed for a bikini line. Watching the girl in the mirror shakily reach down was almost erotic until I felt my own fingers touching that spot and immediately stopped as if I'd been burned. I pulled my gaze away from that spot and tried to focus on the other changes, filing that existential breakdown aside for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the compact size I had some clear feminine curves, with some properly fitting clothes there would no mistaking I was a grown woman. To be fair my bust and butt likely weren't all that big but for my frame it complimented it nicely... I was still in shape at least, though I'd lost a lot of muscle in the transition. My arms and legs were both smooth and slender, complimenting the petite look. My hair was another story. I knew it was long but it stretched nearly to the top of my pert bottom, I could feel it tickling along my back every time it turned my head. It was also a mess from all my panicked running about... it almost made me want to straighten it out but there were more pressing matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow had this happened? We'd talked something about girls last night but it was all pretty fuzzy with all the alcohol involved. Suddenly a noise broke me out of my thought process...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stood in the doorway, half-lidded eyes slowly widening as he stared. \"Am I still dreaming?\" he muttered, his waking brain trying to make sense of this odd image. I'd almost forgotten he was still here, still in his outfit from the night before, just more disheveled from sleeping in it all night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also still had to look up a little despite the fact I was on a god-damn 10\" step stool... Just how short am I?! I couldn't help but feel all the more self conscious that he was continuing to stare. I guess i couldn't blame him, it's not like he was expecting a naked girl in my bathroom... but with it being MY naked body it was hard to be so objective. I covered my chest with one arm and turned to my side so he couldn't see my pussy, trying to ignore how girly the action made me feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?\" I grumbled crossly, I felt a little hot. I really hoped I wasn't blushing right now. That seemed to wake him up a bit as he took a step back out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry Miss, I didn't- Sorry!\" he closed the door and I was once again alone. I stumbled off the step stool to reclaim my t-shirt. It was way to big but at least I'd be covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I know it's not my apartment but... What are you doing here?\" Will asked through the door, ever the gentleman.  I glanced to the mirror seeing the female me with a concerned frown on her face. What was I suppose to do now?</span></div></div>",

Will\u2019s Ex-girlfriend Stacy and I hooked up after a house party one night. We swore it was a drunken mistake and never spoke about it again. However things were never the same and Will always  suspected something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...I did...I\u2019m sorry after that party at Mark\u2019s new place we got way too drunk and well it just sorta happened...\u201d I said confessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou son of bitch! I knew it! Wait....what.....Ben is that really you?!\u201d Will said realizing I wasn\u2019t lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door grabbing a towel to cover myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...I think I need some new clothes...\u201d I said looking up at him.</span></div></div>",

At least this time I was properly covered, though I found myself reflexively pulling the towel closer. A small silence formed between the two of us, taking in the differences between us now. Will was around my height... well my old height, about 6'1\"- 6'2\".  and I definitely had to crane my neck up higher then I ever had since I was a kid... I pulled my gaze away from his face and started to walk past him trying to gauge where I now stood. From what i could gather at a glance the top of my head was about even with his pecs as my eye level seemed to fall just below that...I could feel his gaze still on me as I passed thankful for towel and shirt that at least my rear was covered. Though it didn't do much for my bear legs. I tried not to over-analyze it all and get my mind focused on the most pressing issue at hand. The whys and Hows could wait for now... Clothing was the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I have anything that fits...\" I mutter aloud seeming to break Will from his own stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to pick up something then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still need an outfit to go OUT in though.\" I shot back unable to restrain the heavy sarcasm in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Sorry. Let's take a look to see what we have to work with then.\" He seemed to take my snark in stride immediately getting back on track. Despite all the strangeness it was nice to know Will was one who could roll with the punches. Even in this strange situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of us searching the apartment we able to scrounge together something to at least keep me decent. Pants were out of the question but a pair of shorts with a draw string waist were an ideal find. It had taken a lot of tightening but they least got to the point they could be relied not to slip off of my hips... which was a good thing as none of my boxers or briefs made the cut.It seemed I was shopping commando today. As for a top I had no end of over-sized shirts to work with it, It was only a matter of time before we found one that didn't reveal too much on the down look. Considering most people probably would be looking down at me I held that criteria in high regard. No shoes would fit my tiny feet but an old pair of flip flops at least kept me from having to go barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna be okay going out in that Ben?\" He asked concerned as he pocketed his keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have many options, if anyone questions it we'll just tell them the airport lost my luggage or something.\" I muttered  as I handed him my apartment keys and wallet. At least I didn't have to worry about trying to drive in my new state. \"But where should we go?\" I wondered aloud as we headed out into the hallway. I heard the sturdy click of Will locking up behind us. I glanced up to see him pondering the questions as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

He wasn't wrong, with all those stores they'd be able to find something. the only real downside is how public it would be. I wasn't exactly thrilled at the idea but I couldn't just sit around in over-sized t-shirt all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we can't go to crazy. Just a few outfits to get by until we can find out what happened to me.\" I said doing my best to sound calm and reasonable. \"Then maybe we can look into getting me back to normal.\" I muttered as I climbed into the passenger seat of his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Ben...\" His voice held a clear note of doubt despite his agreement. I chose to ignore that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride over was fairly uneventful, though gave jut enough time to get used to the odd perspective shift with my new height. The prospect of driving again was something I wasn't looking forward to. But those worries were for another day as Will pulled into the lot for Glenwood Mall... It felt like it took nearly as long to find an open parking spot as it did for us to drive over, it being a busy Saturday in a town with not much else to do. It was worth it to not have to walk half a mile to the door. The crowds grew thick quickly as we got inside. Packs of teenagers, couples, older senior exercise groups,  My vision was blocked by a wall of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" a larger hand carefully too my own as Will began to guide me along to some one of the few clear pockets  of floor space between Kiosks. \"We need to be careful not to get separated.\" </span></div></div>",

It's something you do for a younger sibling or a child... or a girlf- I shook my head trying to clear my thoughts before that particular one could finish. I was letting it all get to me. I was still Brian, compact and feminine body notwithstanding. We'd figure out what was going on and I'd be back to normal in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only my heart would stop beating so damn fast... Will said something but I had been too distracted to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said which store did you want to go to?\" he repeated looking slightly bemused, my face felt hot so I turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, um. let's just go there.\" I picked a store at random while I tried to compose myself. With a grunt of agreement he started off and I followed a step behind as we merged back into the busy Saturday crowd. I moved closer to Will to dodge a large group of distracted teens, most of which were taller then me I was annoyed to note. I felt a slight squeeze on my hand as we popped out on the other side, realizing briefly I'd squeezed his hand first. Another rush of warmth accompanied that realization but I kept silent and tried not to think about it. Fortunately the store gave plenty of means for distraction.</span></div></div>",

Is there anything I can help you with today?\" The chipper voice of an employee chimed in as if reading my mind. She kept a professional smile but I could tell by her eyes she was less then impressed by my 'ensemble'. Before I could collect myself enough to reply Will took the reigns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were hoping to pick out some clothes... The airport lost her luggage, her only other outfit got ruined last night.\" He lied smoothly even offering a frustrated sigh.

At least one of them would know what they were doing. \"Where would you like to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Underwear.\" I said after a moment of hesitation. \"I need <i>everything</i>\" she slowly caught on to my emphasis and she covered her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...

Alice led me to a changing room, where I waited for a little bit, until she started bringing me on clothes to wear. It was weird, to say the least, trying on women\u2019s clothing like that. But, I had to admit, they fit a hell of a lot better than anything I\u2019d been wearing beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I was wearing a pair of panties and a bra that matched (both a beige that matched my skin tone), Alice entered the fitting room with multiple outfits, which I was supposed to try on in front of her. The first was clearly casual wear, a simple if stylish blouse and some well fitting jeans. I actually liked wearing them, and almost did a pose in the mirror. \u201cSo,\u201d I heard from behind me right at that moment. \u201cUh, just so I understand the situation right, you\u2019re not interested in your friend at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question made me jump a little, and I quickly started taking the outfit off to try on the next on, which was a little more revealing, with a skirt instead of pants. \u201cW-well, no, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve known him for so long, we\u2019re more like family.\u201d After all, that was the truth, right? It wasn\u2019t like I had any interest in Will at all, no matter how nice and sweet and caring and handsome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you wouldn\u2019t mind if I asked him out?\u201d The question hit me and my runaway train of thought like an atom bomb. For some reason, I quickly started picturing her and Will in a restaurant, then going back to his place and...it made me upset. Who was this floozy, planning to just take Will from me? I looked in the mirror and liked what I saw. I looked good. Better than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jealousy was overflowing all other senses I had, and I more than anything wanted to look attractive, enough that Will wouldn\u2019t even think twice. Without even trying it on, I just looked at the next outfits, a beach bikini and a gorgeous red dress with a low-cut top and told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d It didn\u2019t answer her question, and I meant it that way. \u201cCan you go ring all this stuff up? I\u2019ll get dressed and meet you at the register to pay for it.\u201d It looked like she took my hint, and left me along. Suddenly, with her gone, I realized what had just gone on. Why was I being so possessive of Will? And why...why was I feeling more at home with this body all of a sudden?</span></div></div>",

However seeing Alice out there like that something inside me snapped as I looked around and saw another outfit...one I had previously ignored....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later I stepped out of the fitting room as I made my way towards Will as the expression on his face changed immediately...His jaw almost hit the floor when he saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wearing a skin tight black mini dress that was low cut enough to show my ample cleavage without looking slutty. The dress barely went to my mid thigh and and cling to me like a second skin showing off my feminine curves. I also was wearing a pair of black matching three inch heeled sandals. I was nervous about walking in them at first but soon found myself rather comfortable in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was also carrying a bag of clothes. All the previous outfits which were too girly, sexy, or feminine before. Everything from dresses, skirts, tops, heels, underwear, bikinis,  etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there...sorry...change of plans I want these items instead.\u201d I said with a cheeky smile as Alice have me one of the sharpest bitch eye looks I\u2019ve ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre...uh...are you sure?\u201d Alice said trying not to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...these are better for me.\u201d I replied with a little smile.

The nervousness and awkwardness I had earlier replaced with confidence as I led Will from one store to the next. There was only one down not at bath and body where a very pushy employee INSISTED hair like mine needed appropriate care. I mostly bought it just to shut her up but in retrospect it did smell a lot nicer then the shampoo back home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe decided to unwind from that by looking through the discount bin at the movie shop for old B movies and cheesy martial arts films. We ribbed each other, though from the outside it probably looked like flirting... But that was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was smiling, laughing freely. The morose drunken mess Shwana had left him in the night before was gone, he was back to his old self. It felt good to see him like that.

This was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's nothing,\" I said offering him a bright smile and getting him to redden and look away. he tried to cover it up by looking to another shelf of movies as if he was still pursuing the selection. I had to admit, it was kinda fun to get that reaction out of him too. We gather up a few of the DVDs, figuring a marathon of cheese would be the perfect way to round out the night. The old man at the counter smiled at us as he rung up the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep an eye on that one,\" his whispered to Will but loud enough I could still hear. \"Any girl you can watch the Clones of Bruce Lee with is a keeper.\" Will laughed it off as we left, before looking to me.

I think there is a Target nearby.\u201d Will said as he took another exit and we went into the Target for some basic things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Target I decided to pick up a couple things, I got a toothbrush, deodorant, shampoo and conditioner, even razors. What was weird was I was grabbing all the best feminine and lady brands without even thinking. I just kinda....knew which ones were best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill decided to pick up some food supplies while he was at it. He said something about cooking for us tonight. Will wasn\u2019t a chef or anything but he was pretty good at BBQ and other basic meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stopped me was when I was in the pharmacy section. I was just passing through when all of a sudden I passed the Adult section....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLubes, lotions, condoms, and even vibrators....Normally this stuff I wouldn\u2019t think about but recently....The way my body was starting to react I couldn\u2019t be sure how I would react in the future. I decided to slip a few things into my cart and hope he didn\u2019t notice. I grabbed some warming lube, a box of ribbed condoms, and even a small personal vibrator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust...just in case...these are only for me...for personal use and emergencies....\u201d I kept telling myself over and over again as I went to meet up and check out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately I was quick enough at the cashier to ring things up and keep Will distracted where he didn\u2019t seem to notice my...personal items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was a bit more awkward as I was feeling awkward buying those things without telling Will. My body was also reacting to the idea of using them...I could feel a warmth between my legs and I tightened up a bit keeping my legs closed as I could feel a tightness in my chest and realized my nipples were stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...everything okay?\u201d Will asked. He asked me seeing I was shifting a bit awkwardly in my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...oh yeah...sorry. Still just getting used to all this.\u201d I said playing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were home I took my new clothes and personal items into the spare room where I was staying. I made sure to stash away the personal stuff in a drawer first as I tried to forget about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked to my new outfits as I realized what I had done earlier...In my jealousy I had picked out this sexy dress and taken all the sexy outfits I had originally rejected from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at a collection of short skirts, short shorts, crop tops, low cut blouses, and sexy underwear. In fact the only even sort of modest outfit I had picked out was a pair of tight yoga pants and tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to feel the warmth and tingling sensation return to my body. I slipped out of my dress as I had to decide on a more comfortable outfit to relax in. I was torn...part of me wanted to just take the yoga pants  and tank top and grab a blanket to cover up. The other part me however....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw this really sexy and cute white crop top. It was super tight and didn\u2019t even need a bra. It left my belly button and tight stomach exposed. I paired with this black mini skirt which barely even went to mid thigh....</span></div></div>",

With a small thrill I slipping it over my head and shimmed it into place. it was tight enough to give support to my chest but it wasn't tight enough that it felt stifling. I ran a hand down my side feeling it transition from top to midriff and it felt good...\"Well, I'm already half way there so..\" trying to convince myself more then anyone that this was inevitable. A moment later I looked at myself in the mirror, hand drifting to my hip, posing. I felt sexy, and powerful... It felt good. This wasn't about trying to catch will's eye, this was what I wanted. If i was going to be a woman I might as well look great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it was... wasn't it? Earlier concerns rose up in my chest but I pushed that doubt aside for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to get my hair back in place, noting the knots i had to comb through and hoping the new shampoos I picked up would help with that. Once I was satisfied I head out into the living room. Scents of cooking meat and vegetables drifted out from the kitchen, causing my stomach to rumble. I took a seat on Will's couch lengthwise, instinctively crossing my ankles to keep from flashing anything in the short skirt. I wiggled my bare toes,  which only just reached the other end of the couch against a throw pillow and sighed. The stress of the day melting away to a comfy familiarity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could get used to this... </span></div></div>",

Maybe it was this smaller body, or the stress of the transformation but I honestly didn\u2019t even think about food until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping up I went over to the kitchen and saw Will hard at work, wearing an apron and everything. I have never seen him work so hard to prepare a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, chef Will is in the house? What\u2019s on the menu for tonight?\u201d I said in a teasing sort of tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill smiled and looked back to me. \u201cWell I\u2019m dong a pan stir fry with some cooked vegetables and rice. I also thought I would pair with this lovely $20 bottle of wine from your local Target.\u201d Will said pretending to be a fancy chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his cheesy presentation but something about it made me smile. I took the bottle of wine and looked at it for moment. I have never really bunch much of a wine drinker before, mostly just cheap beer. Something about the wine though sounded really tasty as I popped the cork and poured us both a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we toast to?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo...uh...an interesting day? I guess...I mean it\u2019s not everyday you wake up as a chick right?\u201d I said in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear that.\u201d Will said as we toasted our glasses and drank our wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wine was much nicer than I remembered as a guy. Something about my new female taste buds allowed me to savor it better with more appreciation than I had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was ready a few minutes later as we sat down and ate. To my surprise the food was actually pretty good. Maybe as a guy I just never appreciated nicer foods but this tasted better than I ever remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Will insisted on cleaning up and doing the dishes alone. He actually rejected my offer to help as I shrugged and went back to couch. I finished my glass of wine and had already poured another. I was definitely feeling it already as a heat and warmth and tingling sensation was spreading around my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Will finished up the dishes we tossed in one of the many cheesy B movies we picked up earlier and sat down on the couch to watch it. The movie was an absolutely ridiculous Kung fu movie. Full of over the top fights and bad dubbing work which made it all the funnier to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie progressed I found myself slowly but surely sliding closer to Will...Inch by inch I was getting closer until I was almost right next to him. He definitely seemed to notice but neither of us said a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until I felt something a hand on my knee...Wills hand has landed their after laughing at a funny moment. I said nothing at first as my chest was getting tighter. I could see my nipples getting stiffer and poking throw my tiny top a bit more as a heat was building between my legs. Will\u2019s hand was slowly creep up my knee however heading towards my thigh and maybe even potentially up my skirt....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lip gently wondering if I should let this continue or stop this right now...</span></div></div>",

We were silent for a moment, only the sounds of bad dubbing and breaking furniture in the room. He started to pull his hand away, eyes gaining a guilty look. I quickly grabbed his hand with both of my own, so much bigger and rougher than mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...\" I say in a voice, softer and more sincere then i even realized as i guided his hand back down. He looked surprised before seeming to accept it. He'd been holding back this whole day, even though my crazy episodes and all of this. He deserved a reward... I shift in the couch leaning against him and after a moment of hesitation moving his hand under my skirt. My body tensed, his warm rough hand began to move without my urging up my inner thigh. I didn't realize i was wet until he reached my panties and could feel it. I let out a gasp, he looked concerned but I merely nodded, and soon I could feel him starting to rub.

Pulling back I but my lip gently and reached back and pulled off my top to free my breasts. The cool air stiffened my nipples as Will\u2019s hands roamed them.

It was a level of comfort and security I hadn't felt in years. I knew I was safe with Will, I'd known that before I was a woman but now it felt all the more certain. If I was going to do it with anything. I'm glad it was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that make us? One night of sex didn't mean a relationship... but it could be the start of one. Did I want that?

If this change can be reversed it would just add more complications. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if it was permanent? It was a scary thought.

I'd open my mouth an-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head trying to free the images from my mind, it certainly wasn't helping my situation down below. I leaned against the door frame, clenching my thighs together. I could feel it. Wanting that feeling in me once mor-\"A shower, that's what I need!\" I turned firmly and headed back to the bathroom, with only a small detour to pick up my toiletries and soaps I'd picked up. Closing the door Focused my mind on placing the soaps and shampoos to be within easy grasping distance. All the while distinctly aware of how wet I was, it was good i hadn't put on underwear yet or they'd already been soaked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned on the shower, a cold jet of water coming out from the shower head... Will's pipes took some time to warm up. But maybe this is what I needed right now. I eased my way into the cold water, with gasping breaths. Trying to freeze the lustful feeling from me... I soaped up and wash cloth and started to clean my body... slowly the water got warmer and I could feel it. Everything felt so sensitive. I squeezed my soapy breasts together roughly, at some point I stopped washing and was just feeling myself... One of my hands slipped down my flat stomach and before I could really think about it I was fingering myself. It was somewhat clumsy at first, having never done it before but I knew as soon as I found it. My breathing picked up I rubbed away, building on top of the lingering lustful heat I had had been dealing with all morning. A soft whimper escaped my lips as climax came closer. Images of the night before returned and this time I relished in them, my knees getting wobbly as moved to two fingers to trying and finish off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Will...\" I gave a shuddered whisper picturing his face, his eyes looking at me with desire. \"Take me... Mmph!\" I bit my lip as I climaxed for the second time. This time by my own hand. I stood gasping under the pouring water. Relieved and a bit shamed at what i had done. At the very least It seemed to have done the trick for now... my mind was clearing for the first time since I woke up. I was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that that I was able to move onto finishing washing my body and my hair. The steamy bathroom filling up with the a present flowery scent. It was kind of a pain to wash all this hair. It would likely be easier to get it cut but that was hardly something worth worrying about. I just closed my eyes and made sure to be thorough. Wash it all away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><span class=\"cppink\">Wash it all away Bree....</span></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked as the water started to turn cold again. I must have zoned out a bit. Shutting it down I gingerly stepped out and started to dry off. One of Will towels covered my small frame well enough, another being used to wrap my long mane into a little turban atop my head. I surprised myself with how naturally I did it, but it made things much easier. Will didn't own a hair dryer and I hadn't though to pick one up so this was the next best thing... I hummed a little tune as I stepped back out feeling clean and ready for anything!</span></div></div>",

I looked at my underwear options as I bit my lower lip gently deciding to be just a little bit naughty...I grabbed a pair lace thong panties and slid them up my legs. The feeling was definitely a bit strange. They hugged me tighter around the ass showing it off nicely. Instead of one of my new shirts I actually grabbed One if Will\u2019s T shirts and put it on. It shocked me how large it was on me now. His XL size came down to my knees and it was like wearing a sheet. I laughed a bit to myself and went out to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started cooking up some scrambled eggs and bacon while brewing up some coffee.

It was like my body wasn\u2019t hungry for that at all...In fact all I was hungry for a simple granola bar and some coffee. Not even cream or sugar either, it filled me up completely like a full meal would have before. It was strange I loved the smell of the food I was cooking and the very thought of Will eating it gave me happiness. The masculine image of a man enjoying his hearty breakfast made my toes curl a bit as I bit my lip gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing about this body I wasn\u2019t enjoying was I was walking around on my tip toes all the time. Losing over a foot in height and shrinking to just a little over 5 feet tall and being so petite had it disadvantages. I would have to stretch and reach for all sorts of cabinets and other things Will kept stored on high shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the sounds of moving in the bedroom as it sound like Will was up. A few minutes later after he used the restroom and ready he came out and saw me standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was dressed just a tight white wife beater tank top and a pair of gym shorts. I couldn\u2019t help myself as I smiled to him and waved. My body seemed to betray me however as my nipples were already stiff and poking through his shirt a little a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...you made breakfast?\u201d Will asked a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...that okay?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh....yeah sure I\u2019m just surprised. How...are you?\u201d Will asked obviously feeling a bit awkward about last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was true inside my mind was still processing everything I was also genuinely happy right now too. I wasn\u2019t sure what I should say at this moment however. </span></div></div>",

It seemed Will was also trying to find where we stood right now. Despite that, I found myself still able to offer a bright smile. \"I enjoyed myself last night, as I'm sure you did.\" I added in a teasing manner, though that only seemed to make him more uncomfortable. He was serious about this so I needed to take it seriously as well. \"How about you take a seat and we'll talk it over okay?\" I said in a gentler tone that seemed to take him off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure...\" He made his way over to the kitchen table as I added the finishing touches to his breakfast and arranged it all on a plate. Bringing it over to the table with a skip in my step, ponytail swishing from side to side as I moved. He took it with a small smile before noticing there was only one plate. \"Where's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh me? I already ate while I was cooking. Coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Thank you.\" I could feel him watching me as I poured him a cup from the pot and brought it over to the table, joining him on the other side and propping my head up with my hands. I let him eat, enjoying the pleased expression on his face as he tasted it. A feeling of accomplishment filling my chest... as he was winding down it seemed the right time to continue our discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, About last night.\" I began and I heard him let out a sigh, I held up a hand before he could start. \"We probably shouldn't have let it go as far as it did. Alcohol WAS involved but even so we probably shouldn't have.\" he nodded solemnly. \"That being said... I'm happy that we did.\" I added with a little smile that seemed to take him off guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" I sat up a bit and laced my fingers together. \"If I was going to have sex in this body, I'm glad it was with you. I never felt forced as I know I was safe with you. What you did felt... Amazing. I'm not really sure there's any way to describe it\" I laughed happily, an airy giggle that felt so natural. He joined me, a deeper rumbling chuckle that warmed my heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were pretty great yourself,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you~\" I brought back the teasing tone and a wink, this time he seemed more accepting of it. The air of awkwardness mostly dispelled. \"And so now that we both know it's a bad idea, i don't see why we shouldn't do it again sometime if we get in that mood.\" I said with a little more confidence then I felt, gauging Will's response to my rather odd statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian, That doesn't make any sense.\" he seemed more confused then anything, though hearing him use my old name like that certainly threw the mood off a bit. Old name? No, Male name. My male name just doesn't sound right in this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both adults Will. We're allowed to make bad decisions if it makes us happy.\" At this odd turn of logic he was quiet for a long moment. I waited and gave him the time to formulate a reply. He rubbed his temple and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we can find a way to turn you back though?\" he was concerned, BUT he wasn't saying no, so I took that victory and smiled cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're going to have some weird stories that we don't tell anyone else about.\" His serious expression broke into a resigned smile, shaking his head. \"We're still friends, I'm just purposing we add some...<i>benefits</i> for the time being.\" I add in a lower, more sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, It not fair when you get all sexy about it...\" he grumbled before finally giving in. \"Sure, if you're comfortable with it who am I to turn down such a generous offer.\" We shared a laugh and I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I didn't have to lie about what I was feeling, and my friendship remained intact. Talk about a good start to a new day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Breakfast Will and I decided to go out today. Do some research into why this happened at all. We also would grab some lunch and run some errands while we were at it. Neither of us were confident in getting this resolved yet but at the very least we could rule out some basic possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to my room I had to decide on what to wear and how to present myself. We were just going out to do basic stuff, honestly sweat pants and a hoodie would have worked...so...then...why did I fee this urge to dress up and be sexy? Girls normally hate heels and complain about them...why did the idea of wearing them excite me? They didn\u2019t even hurt like I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t resist the urge to look good again. I decided to put on a black lace push up bra that gave me some ample cleavage to work. It pushed up my breasts nicely making them look bigger. It paired well with the black lace thong I had on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to put on a pair of skin tight jeans I had bought yesterday. They were nice hip huggers which showed off my butt nicely, and were rather short stopping at my ankles. They had holes and rips in them around the knees and thighs but that was done on purpose for style. I also put on a a low cut dark grey blouse that paired well with my bra to show off my ample cleavage. The blouse was also just short enough to show off my belly button and tight stomach just a tad. Finally I put on my black high heeled sandals that I slowly starting to love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also re did my hair, letting it down all the way as I brushed and dried it giving it that silky smooth and wavy feel. I even started to do my own makeup and for some reason it felt really natural as I applied some lipstick, foundation, and blush to myself. Nothing too fancy or over the top, just enough to enhance my already sexy appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at myself as I also began to realize something. This change...this transformation...whatever it was...It had done certain thing to me I hadn\u2019t even realized yet. I didn\u2019t have to shave or anything this morning looking back to it. My legs and my pussy and total bikini line was still baby smooth. Was this part of the change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed how the change didn\u2019t give me other stuff. One was my nails were still short And plain and my ears weren\u2019t pierced yet. I had started to wonder how nice I would look with nice long painted nails and cute painted toenails, and maybe some cute earrings. I even thought about a sexy bellybutton stud to show off a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...why was I even thinking these things? The thoughts had popped into my head out of no where as I shook them off for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill knocked on my door soon after to check on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Brian...You ready time go?\u201d He asked. Like many girls I had obviously taken too long to get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBree!....call me Bree!.\u201d I said with an almost SnapBack like tone. I wasn\u2019t even sure why I said it. It was like the name Brian almost...offended me now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...I\u2019m...sorry. Bree? You ready?\u201d He asked again a bit taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so much better as I smiled and nodded as we went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where to first?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...we could retrace our steps from the night I changed and look for clues? Maybe someone saw something?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...Not sure where that will lead. I\u2019m also not sure what the source of this whole thing is. Either it\u2019s supernatural or it\u2019s science.\u201d Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo either a witch or gypsy cursed me...or I came into contact with some super gender swapping chemical?\u201d I asked back in a slightly sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...yeah...I mean I know it sounds crazy but you are the one who woke up female remember?\u201d Will noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea what could have caused this but deep down something was telling me. </span></div></div>",

Now I walked with a confident sway, wanting those same eyes to show them how sexy i was. Strange really what a day of perspective could bring. As I sat in the passenger seat I forced my mind back to night before and any strange things I could think of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As dumb as it feels to say this... I think it is something magical?\" I said with a certainty I found hard to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what makes you so sure?\" When I thought about it there were a lot of clues, but to voice them out loud would make me seem like a nutjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is probably going to sound... way worse then it actually is. So please don't freak out.\" In retrospect that preface probably made it sound worse, but he offered a nod so i continued. \"Ever since the change I've found myself... knowing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, little conveniences that If I'd been a girl I should know.\" I clarified. Will looked thoughtful for a moment, while keeping his eyes on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does make a lot of the stranger things make sense... You've been adapting a bit <i>too</i> well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Have, haven't I?\" I took a breath and let it go to steady my nerves. \"It's like having a helpful little assistant voice in the back of my mind to smooth over the transition from man to woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this voice... that's all it tells you?\" he asked softly, \"Did it tell you last night to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" I said firmly before he could start down that line. \"That was my own wine clouded decision thank you.\" I said with an odd bit of pride. \"It's just little things, otherwise I'm in full control.\" I said firmly. There was a pause in the conversation, long enough that I found myself glancing over to Will. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If that's really the case Brian-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to call me Bree!\" I found my voice raising, cutting him off. Honestly, I thought I was clear about this earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" he replied, calm as ever. \"A girl named Brian wouldn't fit right? Just 'smoothing things over'. Right?\" Will continued cutting through my anger and making my stomach drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh god.\" Before I realized it I was shaking. That made so much sense but what else would be smoothed over? How much ME would be left? I could feel the car pull over and a hand rested itself over my own. Instinctively I took it and squeezed tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be okay, we'll figure this out. I'm with you the whole way.\" His voice was calming, the deep rumble and the warm hand giving me something else to focus on so i could steady myself again. I nodded but didn't speak. I wasn't ready for that quite yet. After few minutes the horror subsided and rationality returned to my mind. This was what i was fighting, now that I knew that I could be more vigilant to it's coercion. I was in control... and Will was with me. But I had already lost one battle without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, even though I know It made me change my name I... I can't use it. It feels wrong.\" I admitted somberly. The name of Brian was lost to me, it wasn't 'ME' anymore. In my mind and heart I was Bree, whether I had made that choice or not. It was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Will took a deep breath and giving my hand a gentle squeeze. \"We'll find a way to beat this... Bree.\" I nodded, leaning over and kissing the wonderful man on the lips. This wasn't about passion or lust. This was something greater then that, it was the only way i could think to show how much that meant to me... and he responded in kind. We broke apart a moment later with small smiles and one last squeeze. A new determination burned as Will got back on the road and to our first stop...</span></div></div>",

Was it really so hard for me to call myself....Bri....to call him...Brian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened as I tried not to show it. I wasn\u2019t even able to think of myself as ever being Brian. It was like Brian was another person, like a friend or relative that had gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head I tried not to think about it. The important thing was getting answers. I was afraid this Transformation was still far from over and we needed answers to save me from Brian became nothing more than a distant memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur plan was simple. Will took Brian\u2019s drivers license from his wallet and would go around asking people at the bars we visited yesterday if they remembered us talking. He would pretend like Brian has gone missing and was trying to track him down, as any concerned friend would normally do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at the first bar...a simple sports bar we had a few beers at along with dinner the night before I changed. Will and I went inside as he went to the bartender. Fortunately it was the same guy who served us both the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man what\u2019s up? Whoa! Very nice! Guess you\u2019re not having lady troubles are you?\u201d The bartender said. He was an older man. Probably an ex hippie who still got high all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...Uhh..well. I\u2019m actually here about my friend. You know Brian? The one I was here with a couple nights ago? I haven\u2019t seen him  and was wondering if he had been around?\u201d Will said playing it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian...huh? No sorry....doesn\u2019t ring a bell. I really even remember him here the other night.\u201d The bartender replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried me. I had definitely met him before and while not really friends he should at least remember my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on man, here he left his license at my place you recognize him right?\u201d Will saying pulling out Brian\u2019s ID and showing it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man..:I think that\u2019s a fake, or something is for sure wrong with it.\u201d The bartender said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s a normal...what the hell?\u201d Will said looking at it confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the license from him as I was equally confused. The license was all blurry. The picture was a blur as were all the words and numbers. It was like the entire thing was out of focus you couldn\u2019t make out any details at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...we will come back.\u201d Will replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the bar and went to the other one. The last bar before we went home. Same story. Bartender didn\u2019t even remember Brian and the license was still fuzzy. We sat in the car afterwards and a mixture of fear and tension fell over us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think this means?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think...I think it means Brian is fading from existence...The more I embrace becoming Bree the more he fades away. My body could still be changing...my life and memories too.\u201d I said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why am I the only one who remembers the real you?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause this all started when we were talking about your ideal girlfriend remember?\u201d We are bound to this together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will fight this together it\u2019s okay.\u201d Will said leaning in to give me a supportive hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug wasn\u2019t enough for me right now. I needed comfort and Will\u2019s body could give that to me. I pulled him in deeper and began kissing him passionately. My mind immediately imagining him inside of me again as I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...\u201d I said suddenly pulled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel something...\u201d I said as suddenly. </span></div></div>",

The grumblings sounded almost disappointed in me as they grew quieter. The energy seemed to move from my mind turning into a chill down my spine that caused me to shiver. In a moment it passed and I could hear Will again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree, Talk to me! Are you okay?\" His genuine concerned warmed my heart. Such a sweetheart. I nodded and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fought it off this time.\" I said with a note of pride. \"It was going for my memories but I fought it off and it backed down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a very subtle feeling, so I'm not sure I'll be able to catch it every time,\" I added reluctantly. It had been such a close thing. A second later and I might have even noticed it at all. \"But this means it can be fought, I can keep from changing.\" I noted happily before noting Will was frowning. \" What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Bree. Check your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hands, what do you mean?\" I looked to my hands with a frown. They were dainty as ever. They could really used something to spice them up. Well, the Ruby red was a nice shade maybe it was too bold for this outfi-Wait. \"Did my nails paint themselves?\" I asked allowed... they weren't just painted either. They were longer but clearly well manicured, looking classy and feminine. I swallowed and looked back up to Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you stopped the memory theft and it gave you Nails? So it's either a physical or mental change? I guess this is better than the alternative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only get so girly though... I mean your ideal girl was one with spunk and fire. My personality in a smaller, cuter package\" I quoted as if it were a fact ingrained in my mind. \"Once there's nothing physically left...\" He took my hands in his own, crouched down next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to figure something out before it gets that far.\" Will said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" We share another kiss and parted safely this time, desire bubbled within me but I tried to think past it. I wasn't a slut who just jumps her man in the middle of the street. I had class damn it! As soon as we get back to the apartment though I'm tearing those pants right off of him... The mental promise of sex seemed to tame my libido for the moment. \"So we walked from here If I remember correctly. Didn't we stop for more drinks over at O'Halligan's before going back to your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, it's only a few blocks up off of Main st.\" next goal in mind we started down the street.

Nothing but swindlers and coming artists taking advantage of the desperate and ignorant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well...until recently I might agree but all things considered..\u201d Will said gesturing to me in a rather obvious way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight...I guess all things considered magic wasn\u2019t really something I could dismiss out of hand anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...lets just go in and ask something very general. Don\u2019t tell her anything specific about me.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I can agree to that.\u201d Will said as we went in together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the shop smelled of incense and was decorated with all sorts of wild and mystical things one would expect to find in a typical Gypsy shop. It only took a moment for her to emerge from the back curtain and see us. Madam Noir was an older Gypsy woman. White hair tied up with a scarf and decorated with tons of old looking jewels and rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...how gawdy.\u201d I thought to myself still not buying into this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome my children please come and...and...\u201d Madam Noir said before she paused and looked to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...yes?\u201d I asked a little off put by her staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...child...you have two souls...have you been cursed?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Noir wasted no time in coming over to me. She grabbed my face with her palms and stared into my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne body...in flux...not complete...two souls...fighting for dominance...one life ends while the other begins. My child...someone has cursed you.\u201d She said pulling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about curse?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who but someone placed a curse on her. Cursed play on irony...they takes the words of someone. Such as a vain wish and twists it into something else. Please I must ask that you leave...\u201c Madam Noir said trying to dismiss us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease you must know how we can fight this?\u201d Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly the caster of the curse knows the conditions to break it. Find them and make them confess.\u201d She said showing us the door not wanting any more part of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...uh...that was weird.\u201d I said not sure what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo...do you believe her?\u201d Will asked a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe. All I know is this stuff is making my head spin.\u201d I replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat around for another hour or so just talking. We went over everyone in our pasts who might have a grudge on us. While neither of us were perfect and both had bad break ups, crappy bosses and the like but nothing we thought that would make someone curse us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill took out Brian\u2019s old license as he looked at it again. The picture was still blurry but he noticed something else. The frame and picture didn\u2019t look the same. The outline of the person in the photo seemed more...feminine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI busy distracted looking at my new nails admiring how nice and long and pretty they were. I was thinking of how I could also use a pedicure soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey let\u2019s make one more stop at the last bar we went to okay?\u201d Will said as I looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I said with a smile. At this point I was just happy we were together through all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way to O\u2019Halligans and we arrived we made a rather shocking discovery...</span></div></div>",

The old bartender, the bar's namesake, enforced that atmosphere with a deceptively strong arm for an old man... Stepping in filled me with a nice familiarity. Which helped calm my nerves from the rather intense encounter with the fortune teller. It had a few of the regulars could be spotted among the tables and bar, but was still too early for any big crowds. The bartender was cleaning a glass as he looked up and a smile snuck onto his grizzle face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will me' boy, Surprised to see you back so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, We were drinking pretty hard last time and needed to check on something.\" Will said calmly as we approached the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" he cocked his head slight before locking eyes with me. He smiled broadly. \"Ah, Bree my dear. I didn't see you there!\" He said in his usual boisterous tone. I froze and I could feel Will tense up as well. \"Did you two finally get back together now? I certainly hope so, I always thought that Shwana girl wasn't doin' you any favors.\" he said conversationally and I looked to my License with all my information and a rather poor picture of myself. They never let you retake them, honestly if I'd had another sh- wait... wasn't this Brian's? I looked up to see the Bartender gaining a confused frown. \"What's wrong? It looks like you too have seen a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You don't remember.\" Will started but he was clearly rattled so I gave his hand a squeeze and took the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just been a long couple of days and We were trying to  find someone.\" I started with a ease that surprised even myself... maybe deep down I expected this in some way. We're likely the only people who remember Brian at all. We needed to keep our head in the game if we going to find a way to save him. \"But there was so much alcohol flowing the events of the evening were pretty fuzzy. So did you remember seeing anyone else odd that night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else odd?\" He chuckled heartily, \"Lass behind a bar you see all kind of odd folk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that woman in black?\" From further up the bar an Old man chimed in. He was a veteran and was a near constant feature on his same stool every night I'd visited... Usually I hated when he'd but into other conversations but this time I couldn't help but be thankful. \"Always comes it looking like some Halloween reject, never understand young people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman in black? What about her?\" I glance between the old veteran and the barman expectantly. Old Man O'Halligan looked thoughtful for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, come to think about it she was around that night, she came up to the bar to talk to Will while you were in the Ladies room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She What?!\" I felt a surge of jealousy rise with in me, the importance of this clue overshadowed by the anger. Moving in on Will when he was vulnerable. I was picking up the pieces that Shwana left him in and some goth bitch tried to make a move? I could feel Will place a hand on my shoulder to try and calm me down, taking over the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember talking to anyone else... What was she like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

It helped keep a fun and lively atmosphere at the bar. It took us a minute but we soon found the girl in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately looking at her my blood began to boil...it was like she was everything I wasn\u2019t...I knew I was sexy, but I was sexy in a petite and small frame. This girl was sexy in every way I was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was only like 5\u20192 she was clearly like 5\u20198. I was super skinny with nice perky C-cups, she was curvy with full DDs. My thin and petite frame paled compared to her perfect hourglass shape. She had wider hips, large fuller ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had long brown hair down to my waist, she had raven black hair all the way to her ankles. She kept tied up in a long braided ponytail too. She also had longer nails that were raven black and even wore black lipstick. She was wearing a skin tight black leather corset that pushed up her big tits and a black leather mini skirt that barely went to mid thigh. Her flat stomach was exposed with a silver stud in it along with silver earrings and even a silver stud in her nose and eyebrow. She wore black stiletto heels as well. She had several tattoos as well, it looked like most them bird related. I saw what looked like a raven on her lower back in one photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust staring at her in these photos made me mad. She was obviously super sexy. The kind of girl you don\u2019t take home to mom...The kind of girl who would fuck your brains out on a first date and leave you begging for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh are you guys friends of Raven?\u201d A female voice behind us suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around it was one of the waitresses working here. She was pointing to the girl we were looking at as my hatred now had a name AND face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...sorta. We are looking for her. When does she usually come around?\u201d Will asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...usually Friday or Saturday nights? She has her group of friend usually. However you can\u2019t miss her.\u201d The waitress replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can you tell me about her?\u201d I asked out of the blue...I wasn\u2019t sure why I asked but I was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a wild card for sure. She can drink almost any guy under the table and doesn\u2019t hesitate when it comes to getting what she wants. Guys always want her but she is actually super picky. She usually finds the guy she wants and does everything she can to make her his.\u201d The Waitress replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe left the bar shortly after taking the photo with us. Back in the car Will looked to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think she is the one? The one  Who cursed us?\u201d Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she looks like a witch for sure...probably a bitch of a witch while we are at it.\u201d I said in a super bitchy tone. I was obviously unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what\u2019s your problem?\u201d Will asked a bit taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy problem is you were probably flirting with this bitch while I was in the restroom!\u201d I snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to yourself! We don\u2019t know if she is even involved! Let\u2019s calm down. Let\u2019s come back here tomorrow night and try to find her. We can ask some questions and try to figure this out.\u201d Will said trying to calm me down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took several deep breaths doing what I could to calm myself down. It took a minute but I finally got there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me...all I can focus on is that woman\u2019s body and now can I be sexier than that?\u201d I said panting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body kept telling me to make myself sexier to keep Will from even thinking of going to her. It was like the curse thing didn\u2019t even bother me right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...let\u2019s...let\u2019s just head home.\u201d I said with a smile. I leaned in and kissed Will\u2019s cheek again as I tried to ignore the building heat between my legs. </span></div></div>",

In the passenger seat tried to contain myself, the more I thought about that Raven bitch the more angry I got... that anger turning into a powerful lust to 'reclaim' my man. Give him such a good time he'll forget he ever met her... The logical voice reminded me that he had, in fact, not remembered meeting her in the first place but it was swiftly forgotten... By the time we got back to Will's place I could barely contain myself. I didn't speak and focused on just getting up the stairs, gripping his hand tightly the whole way. As soon as the door was closed and locked I took a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me Will.\" I said in a tone that broke no argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you agreed to being friend's with Benefits and I need those Benefits right now.\" I was already pulling my top off and tossing it aside. \"It's your fault really when you thank about it.\" I said strutting up to him and tracing a finger down his chest. \"If your dream girl didn't have such a high libido we wouldn't be having this moment now would we? \" I said in a breathy voice as my hand reached his pants which has a noticeable bulge to them. I squeezed it through the material. \"So you should take responsibility and take off your pants.\" I ordered with a hungry expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few moments for him to break, and we were on our way to the room, clothe strune around the living room. He was carrying me as we made out. Our tongues danced and battled and I moaned with pleasure. I need this, I need Will... He tossed me to the bed following me a moment later and the kissing continued. I grind against him, his erect member brushing against my lips, only driving the fire hotter. I needed him inside me again. I broke off the kiss and gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Condoms, top drawer.\" he was already reaching as I instructed. The few seconds it took for him get unwrapped and on felt like an eternity. I gripped the sheets above me, writhing unable to think.In the back of my mind there were whispers, coming in my moment of weakness. I tried to regain control, to stop them like I had earlier... Will inserted  inside me and my mind went blank. The fighter in me made one last reach before all could think of was passion. It was even better then the night before, the awkwardness was gone. I knew how to shift my body to let him in even further, I moans shamelessly and hit climax first... Will paused surprised but more so when I grabbed him. \"Let's switch,\" I said between gasps getting him to lay down while I eased on to his still erect penis with a whimper of pleasure and started going again... Even in the afterglow of my own climax I pushed on building up again. I had to make sure he got off too... This wasn't about self-satisfaction. I wasn't a whore like Raven. I needed to make sure my man enjoyed himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI some knew what to do, urging him faster while I squeezed tighter for him to feel it more. I rode him hard, dragging my nails over his bare chest. This time I held my own urges and chest watching him until he reached his limit before I allowed myself to give in fully. We came together... the second wasn't quite as strong as the first but the bliss and satisfaction I got from seeing his own pleasure made it all the sweeter. I laid atop his chest, both exhausted. He wrapped his arms around me and I snuggled into his chest, listening to his heartbeat steadily. There was no where in the world I'd rather be right now... I vaguely remembered fighting something earlier... but for the life of me I wasn't sure what it was. It wasn't till we moved to clean up that I realized...</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t until I got a good look at myself I began to notice something different about myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral strands of my brunette hair were lighter. They were a bright blonde compared to the rest. It wasn\u2019t very noticeable yet but it seemed they were blonde all the way to the root. I also noticed something odd. My ears were pierced. Three times in each ear, two lower and one upper. I also noticed my bellybutton was pierced as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was stranger was there was also a box on the counter I never recognized before. It was a really nice wooden box. I opened it and smiled seeing a whole bunch of jewelry. Somehow I just knew it was mine. I couldn\u2019t help myself as I put in two small silver hoops in my bottom ear piercings as well as small silver studs in the other ones. I also picked a fancy shiny silver stud for my belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at myself in the mirror I was happy, the jewelry made me look fancy, like a princess or queen. That\u2019s exactly how I wanted to be treated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed something else a bit odd. My boobs felt a little different. They seemed rounder. Normally my natural breasts had a normal tear drop shape to them and only the slightest sag, the kind that comes natural. However they seemed rounder than before, their natural sag vanishing. Reaching up I felt them and noticed they seemed a littler heavier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went out to surprise Will as he was getting up as he looked into the cabinet where I kept the condoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey did you know the condoms are all gone?\u201d He said showing they had all mysteriously vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do we need condoms I had an IUD placed last year?\u201d I suddenly said almost instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...why did I say that? Wait...why did I remember that? All of a sudden I could remember myself sitting at a doctors office having the birth control device implanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head I began to see the curse was spreading even more. It was altering reality itself and my past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sat down and tried to calm myself. We knew this was happening we had to remember that. Freaking out at this point solved nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what should we do?\u201d Will asked curious of our next move. </span></div></div>",

Brian would be gone and I would take over... But that didn't seem fair, Brian hadn't done anything wrong. On top of that he was Will's closest friend, and currently the only one who could fully remember him as my own memories get eaten away and altered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, we can go back out tomorrow, now that we have a lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" I said softly, the niggling voice pointing out a truth I wasn't sure I wanted to think about.

I needed comfort tonight. Went through the living room gathering up out discarded clothes, I could hardly leave our apartment turning into a mess like it was before I moved in. It was that ladies touch after all. It was all stowed away in the laundry bin by the time he came back out and I when up on my tips toes to share a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe... So what do want to do for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just order out?\" I say with a sigh. \"I really just want to have some cuddle time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" He gave me a half hug before heading off to the couch and flopping onto it sighing into the pillows. I shouldn't have to be going through all this stress on vacation. But I could hardly go back to work at the... Where did i work again? I groaned louder in annoyance as I was giving myself a headache. I could hear Will's footsteps approaching. \"Ah, gonna make room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I said childishly. \"If you want a seat you'll have to move me.\" I found a hint of playfulness entering my voice. Just Will being near by really helped smooth over so many things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" he sounded bemused and I could feel him moving closer, he could lift me up with no problems. I'll give him a little Kiss on the nose an- My body tensed as he started viciously tickling me. I gave a shrill squeak and started to struggle but I couldn't escape his touch, I remember Brian was also ticklish but it wasn't like two bros would have a tickle fight. It seems we still shared some things in common. Through the laughter I managed to grab one of the throw pillows and try to beat him off with it but that caused him to double down his attacks. I was only able to hold out for a few minutes before I forced to give in. Breathing hard, sides hurting from laughing too much. He assumed his spot on the couch and took a slap on the shoulder for his trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're smiling.\" he noted triumphantly. Which was true, even as annoyed i was I was smiling. His smug little smirk making him cuter didn't help. With a huff laid back on the couch my head in his lap looking up to him. \"Feeling better?\" has asked, idly running a few fingers through my hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just... a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silences for a few minutes as we just enjoyed the quiet, the soothing feeling of his fingers through my hair. A moment I both knew had never happened before and yet I could remember happening intimately. This duality that I just couldn't escape from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\" I asked softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If it comes down to it.\" I started before biting my lip unsure if i should continue... but I had to know. \"Which would you rather have...

It was as selfish feeling but I couldn't help who i was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it comes down to it.\" Will started and my breath hitched. \"If there isn't some way yo keep save both of you.\" it was clear he was tone but he said...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s just..You are just so perfect...I honestly couldn\u2019t imagine a better girlfriend if I tried...I know that\u2019s selfish of me...that\u2019s why I\u2019m determined to fix this curse and get you back to normal. My selfish desires shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of your life.\u201d Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly I was a bit surprised at his answer. It was honest and true and maybe that\u2019s why I respected it. I be totally if this whole situation was reversed I doubt I would react much differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at his answer and kissed his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s okay I understand...I mean...look at me right?\u201d I said in a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe decided to order a pizza and watch a movie tonight. Resisting the urge to go out and do anything. I only had one slice of pizza as my reduced appetite wouldn\u2019t let me have more. I also said no to wine. I wanted to be in full control of<br>\r\nMyself tonight with no help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe watched the movie all cuddled up for the first half. I felt so safe and warm in his arms it really made me smile. I drifted off into the comfort and happiness of the situation for awhile, however...I would feel the warmth returning between my thighs as I was already getting horny again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Will asked as He noticed me squirming and rubbing my legs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands were roaming to his crotch already as I looked up to him with a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan I suck you off while you watch the movie?\u201d I asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill looked back to a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean...yeah if you want to.\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached over and unzipped his pants and I pulled out his long and erect member as I couldn\u2019t help myself. I began to lick it teasing the tip as I placed my mouth over it and began to suck slowly at first. Picking up speed as I went. Along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moans and groans coming from Will meant I was doing a good job which encouraged me to continue. I was happy with my progress but also blissfully unaware of the consequences of my actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I sucked the more my hair was starting was starting to change. It was getting blonder by the second...the brown locks getting lighter and lighter until my whole hair was a nice dirty blonde...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill hadn\u2019t noticed yet because his eyes were closed as he Moaned lost in pleasure. When he did finally open them he was close to climax as he tried to tell me something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBree....bbb...Bree!\u201d He tried to say but apparently I was too good at my job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the heat of the moment I took this as a compliment. I began pumping faster not realizing the changes as my hair was getting blonder and blonder. Not just that either. It was getting longer, silkier, smoother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more i sucked the more they changed, going from brown, to dirty blonde, to honey blonde, to bright blonde, to golden blonde, and above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill wanted to say something but his climax was too near as he felt himself about to explode. I was lost too sucking wildly until I get him twitch as he began to erupt inside my mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took his load in stride. Not caring at all as I swallowed like a good girl. However this final act seemed to seal the deal as my locks took their one last change turning a bright, pure platinum blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBree...your hair...\u201d Will said panting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached up and felt the new locks, they get softer, almost silk like to the touch. Jumping up I went to the bathroom and gasped seeing them. My brown hair was now a pure shiny silver color, even longer than before as the tips touched my ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I tried to say something.\u201d Will said rushing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...okay....\u201d I said trying not to ruin the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had done it again...lost myself in the moment and slipped one step closer away from returning to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the rest of the night just cuddling. I forced myself not to do anything sexual. All I needed right now was comfort as we drifted off to sleep some time later in the night. A simple and beautiful embrace, sweet and blissful. </span></div></div>",

I was still very much in the arms of my man, though this time I was dressed. In one of his t-shirts but it was something. There was someone else at attention and couldn't help my smile mischievously. We had a long day a head of us so I'd need to get as much out of my system in the morning that I could. I rolled over and looked to his sleeping face as I reached down and snuck his morning wood from his boxers griping in gently and rubbing slowly so not to wake him up right away. He offered a grew sleepy grunts and cute expressions before I started to speed up. Groggily he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha, Bree?\" I responded by kissing him on the lips and offering him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Handsome.\" I said playfully as I continued to message his member at just the right speed to keep him going without pushing him too far. \"Just sit back and enjoy.\" I whispered in his ear before biting it and the sliding down. He rolled over as I crouched over the erect shaft and licked my lips. I went down like I had the night before, a bit more playful then hungry. I could feel the draw to fully put it in but I'd rather he be full conscious for that. This was just a bit of morning service for the man I loved. I finished him with a smile, swallowing the how load as if it were the most natural thing to do. He was left breath hard and very much now awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, what did I do to deserve that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being too damn cute when your asleep.\" I teased as I hopped out of bed and toss my long hair, naturally getting it to fall in a way it wouldn't get in the way. \"I expect you you make it up to me later though.\" I said with a hungry smirk as I pranced off to the bathroom to take a nice morning shower. Despite having had my hair nearly double in length I washed it efficiently and with care, I enjoyed the hot water pouring over and found myself humming a tune, my mind didn't recognize right away despite the fact I was singing it flawlessly. It was one of the big dance tracks of last summer and One of my favorites. Back before Will had started seeing Shawana when we were still doing the friends with benefits thing... it made me realize how much I really needed Will in my life again. These last few days have just been so great. It would be nice to go out again to day and have a proper Date maybe make it official finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Brian!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze for a second and shook the cobwebs out. It had almost gotten me there... It was getting harder to keep him in focus. Soon it might be up to Will alone to keep this going. I didn't hate Brian. He was Will's best friend and that made him important to me too... maybe that's how I could do this. If I took these confusing dual memories and looked at them differently... If I gave Brian a place outside of me I might be able to keep him alive in a way. I spent the rest of my shower thinking about, trying to sort things  could still remember that definitely weren't me into this other category... I heard the shower curtain move and Will stood, in all his glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Please do~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got a bit distracted but we eventually finished our showers and I felt even better... I'd just need to be good on our trip today investigating that Raven chick and we could have some more fun tonight. I could hardly wait. Clear thoughts only returned with long drying process of my hair. The lower up of the dry and combs bring my mind back to what i was trying before...</span></div></div>",

These things were small. Not something one would pick up unless you were really looking for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed my teeth seemed whiter, the small stains that never seem to go away were almost non existent. It was like I had them bleached recently. They also seemed straighter, more in line than slightly crooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also noticed my skin seemed even smoother than before, small skin imperfections like moles, scares, or acne, I couldn\u2019t find them anywhere now. Lastly I noticed something down at my toes. They were a slutty different color than the rest of my body. They were a very nice bronze color, like one would get at a professional tanning place or with really hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my boobs again too noticing their natural shape was almost gone now. They looked like two perfect Medium sized orbs hanging perfectly from my chest. Giving them a small squeeze I swear I could feel them almost humming, like they were waiting to grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is happening to me?\u201d I asked myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour becoming the perfect girlfriend...\u201d A male voice suddenly said echoing in the back of my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was familiar I swear I knew it...that\u2019s when it hit me...it was Brian!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour becoming perfect, in both body and mind. Not just his version of perfect...but yours as well. The kind of perfect girl you always imagined, combining with Will\u2019s vision.\u201d Brian\u2019s voice echoed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...no...I\u2019m not gone yet! I\u2019m still me!\u201d I said shaking the voice away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to bed and tried to focus on all the best memories of Will and Brian. I remembered all their stupid late nights. Making total fools of each other. Being total idiots and loving every second of it. These memories seemed to help as I felt myself regaining some feeling of control again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was able to use this trick to get by for the majority of the morning. Even though it seemed like at every turn my mind wanted to focus on other things...sexy things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down I began to realize something...I wanted will inside me...not just that...I needed him to cum inside me...If he came inside me my body would finally finish changing, I knew it. It was the last thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis struggle was killing me...I wanted my body...my true body..for tonight. To show off to that Raven bitch. However I knew I shouldn\u2019t...I needed to hold on to every ounce of Brian I had left...</span></div></div>",

It was hanging by a thread that was left of my willpower. My libido was so high it was hard to fight of this urge. But I had do. I gripped the top of the touch tightly and closed my eyes, taking a deep breath in and out in some poor excuse for meditation. It wasn't working, I could almost hear the female voice laughing at me. Fuck you bitch I'm trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree... you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No.\" I admitted looking up to the handsome man I loved.

I don't know how much longer I can hold out.\" I said in a pined voice. \"If we don't find anything today I... I won't be able to go back.\" Somehow I knew this was the truth. Will tightened his grip around his keys. The best I could do is warn him of the stakes... Brian was his friend after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Then we'll just have to do everything we can...\" He said seriously before walking up and giving me a kiss, the blissful feeling tugged my my thread of willpower and I pulled myself cloth to him deepening the kiss. I managed to break away, knees weak and getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... have no Idea who bad I want you right now.\" I whispered and managed to take a shake step back and he seemed to catch on to how thin a tightrope he was walking. \"We should go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"</span></div></div>",

There was the urge screaming at me that I SHOULD be drawing their eyes, being sexiest damn thing they'd seen... but this wasn't about me. This was for Will and Brian.

Finish the curse. If you complete the transformation and can overcome it then the contract is void and I can tell you everything including on how to break it.\u201d Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what it means...complete the curse and change and then live your life..be the person the curse wants you to be for a full week. 7 days...at the end of that week if there is anything left of the real you come to me. You must openly and willingly admit you want to be turned back after everything. You do that and you\u2019ve proven you are stronger than the curse. I\u2019ll give up my contact and give you the counter curse details.\u201d Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeven days? I can barely hold out now?

I was strong...both Brian and Bree were strong. We would find a way to make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...there is just one more thing.\u201d Raven said as she turned around to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy contact is rather smart...they put a clause in the contract in case you tried this...in the event you try to go your week and break it I\u2019m obligated to attempt to seduce Will.\u201d Raven said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said suddenly furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m obligated to seduce him...No magic allowed of course just good old fashioned sex appeal. If I succeed and sleep with Will not only are you stuck forever in that body you will also lose Will...\u201d Raven said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stay away from him! Besides we will just stay inside!\u201d I said snapping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stay inside. You have to go out and live the normal life of Bree. You also can\u2019t say anything about this contract to Will...If he discovers anything about this little contest the contract is void and you lose.\u201d Raven said with a wicked laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe it...Not only did I have to embrace this damned curse and live another week as a Bree I had now fight off a Rival who was determined to ruin everything for us both. Not to mention the ultimate mystery. Who hired her to begin with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Raven leave as I was stuck there alone. I couldn\u2019t mention any details of this contest to him. I had to just let things be for now and hope my bond with Will could be strong enough for him to resist the temptress that was calling for him.</span></div></div>",

Admittedly the hard part of the curse would be over soon. After tonight. But what would it be like to live like this? A lot of the details of reality are fuzzy at the moment... What did I do for work? Was I still in the office or had I found a new path through college? Not to mention some college girl was going to be making moves on Will and I couldn't even warn him. I had to fight over him, prove I was the better woman, earn my happy ending... and then give it all up? Could I give him up? I could feel a hand on my shoulder, offering sympathy but looking back there was no one there... It was big, and kind of felt like Will's but it was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree?\" Will's voice draw my attention back to the path. He stood holding Raven's picture. \"I've been looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just needed to take a rest.\" I lied as I hopped back to my flip flops. \"Any luck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually, I had a run in with Raven.\" he said and I could feel my blood boil. \"She said she didn't know how to do curses, apparently she gets the witch accusation a lot because of how she dresses.\" the lying slut. \"But she does post a lot in communities that claim to know magic and said she'd keep an ear open if she heard anything.\" he seemed relieved at least for a moment before gaining a concerned look. \"Babe, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fine.\" I said sharply as I walked over to him and took his hand with both of mine, choosing the one that had Raven's picture in it and squeezing tightly to crumple it. \"At least we found another lead, right? I don't know about you but I'm hungry. Why don't we let me get into some proper clothes and than we can got out somewhere nice.\" I said tracing a finger along his chest and gaining a hungry smile. \"and perhaps an appetizer for you at home before we go.\" There was no reason to fight this urge anymore, it was still the first step to beating the curse. Will was clearly struggling with his own temptation, no doubt piecing together that our sexual escapades had been speeding the process along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you still be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be more than okay, I'm not beaten yet.\" I said with confidently... My thin thread of willpower was bolstered out of sheer want to spite Raven and whoever hired her.  I would let them know that Bree Henson was not to be fucked with.</span></div></div>",

Feeling him inside me naturally was so much better. Will started on top and rode me until I wanted more and switch and got on top riding him. I could feel his cock twitching inside me. I knew he was close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna...\u201d Will said panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...do it...cum inside me.\u201d I called out. I wanted to feel it fill me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill couldn\u2019t hold himself back. He began to erupt inside me as his warm cum shot up inside me. The feeling was amazing...It raised my own orgasm to new heights as I cried out in pleasure my whole body shaking as I fell down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat there panting. Covered in sweat and sex as Will looked to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure this is okay?\u201d Will called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...I had my IUD implanted last year remember? Besides I needed this.\u201d I said kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill suddenly looked at me as his eyes roamed my body before he suddenly pointed at my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBree! Look! You are changing again!\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay...This is just my final step.\u201d I said knowing this would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill was pointing out the bronze skin tone on my toes. It was rapidly spreading up my body. The funny thing was as my skin took on a perfect bronze tone and lost all its imperfections, new memories began to emerge within me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember going to a tanning salon. One that uses special UV lights to give you that perfect natural tone. I also remembered  having laser hair removal treatments. That\u2019s why I never have to shave. My skin was now the perfect bronze goddess tone I had been expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hips also widened a bit as my butt swelled just a bit. It helped give me a sexier more hourglass shape. New memories of me squeezing into skin tight yoga shorts to show off my ass starting popping into my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally my breasts completed their shape change. Turning into perfectly rounded orbs as they began to swell and grew about a cup size turning into a perfect 36 D cup. While obviously not the biggest ever, on my petite body they still looked huge and hung off me perfectly with no sag. New memories of me getting a boob job about 6 months ago began to surface. Apparently these tits were paid for with some kind of crowd funding project?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lips also became just a bit more plump and luscious looking as my facial features were refined into sexy perfection. Memories of me working of myself and getting my look down just right popped into my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes settled into place as my body was finally completed. New memories flooding into me bit by bit. I kept remembering things, cameras, microphones, computers, selfies...underwear and bikinis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...lots of underwear and bikinis....these things kept popping into my mind...why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up suddenly as Will laid back watching me. I walked over to the drawers by the closet and opened them as was surprised to see several drawers full of all sorts of different kinds of lingerie and bikinis...dozens of different styles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of me posing in these things on camera....Will...taking these photos and shooting me on camera...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories began to get clearer...I\u2019m a model...well sorta...I\u2019m an internet model and blogger. I specifically model new and exciting kinds of lingerie and bikinis. I post pictures of myself on social media. I do live chats and even stream now. My revenues come from donations from my fans and I even send out signed sexy photos for money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy tag is \u201cBree the bikini girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBree...why...I\u2019m remembering things?\u201d Will said as it seemed he was starting to remember things as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese new memories were threatening to overwhelm me...I could feel Brian slipping away I was forgetting who I was! I could barely remember ever being him as Bree seemed like all there was....</span></div></div>",

I focused on them, pushing at the grasping hands that were trying to take them from me as I had the night before . \"Don't forget!\" I wasn't sure if I was shouting to Will or myself. As my head started to pound. Bree Henson asserted full control of reality but I held the handful of aberrant memories that didn't fit to my chest refusing to let them go. \"Don't... Forget...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree!\" Vertigo hit and I could feel myself falling before it when black. The girl static and whispers seemed to be away and for the first time in days my mind what silent save for my own thoughts. I laid in silence, floating through a void. I could feel my changed body in intimate detail. I felt complete, whole. My history all in order... my futile work in an office before falling into the blog-sphere as social media was really taking off as a way to make a living. I took the risk and managed to carve of out  niche of Hungry men and other small girls who didn't feel confident in themselves... I offered advice and showed off my goods in equal measure. I was getting paid to be myself instead up some cog in the machine. I still had to keep on top of trends, I was an influencer so I'd get a lot of offers but I had a loyal enough following that I rarely had to debase myself in anything I didn't stand for... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule number one though was that I was a one man girl, I was dating Will and I did not cheat. No nudes and no services. My regular audience understood this fact and respected it. Those that didn't would soon realize I was not gonna to rise to their offers no matter how great. I may be a party girl, I may be considered lewd, and much of my life was out there in the public eye... But I was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\"... Bree.\"</i></font> reality started to assert itself once more. A man was looming over me with a solemn smile. it wasn't will and the face was a bit blurry. I just couldn't quite place it. His mouth moved but no more sound came out but it looked like he was saying... thank you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree!\" I blinked Will was looming over me, face clearly concerned. I smiled and giggled waving it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Hun, I guess I had a bit of vertigo.\" I slowly sat up, my head aching but it was easing. He supported me and helped me back up to my feat. I gave him a peck on the check. \"Didn't mean to worry you like that. Maybe I shouldn't have skipped breakfast like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Will assured me watching me like a hawk as I got steady on my feet feeling even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should probably get something to eat, I heard of this nice Greek place that opened up I've been dying to go to.\" I said conversationally as I went to get ready for our lunch date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good...\" Will said a bit torn. \"Hey Bree... You, remember Brian. Right?\" He asked softly, concerned. I turned back to him and blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, that friend of yours that went missing right? I mean we spent all morning looking for clues didn't we?\" I smiled at him. \"and People call me the airhead.\" I teased. The concerned melted off of him and he gave a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry. Silly question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Thought back to the day and my confrontation with the Goth slut Raven... I had a week to fend her off before I'd win our little contest. I couldn't remember exactly what was said but she knew something about Will's friend and she'd only tell me if I could beat her. I wasn't going to lose Will to her, that was a given, but if I could put her in her place and teach her not to mess with me later on. All the better.</span></div></div>",

The day to day updates kept my social media page running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure everything is okay?\u201d Will asked on our way to lunch. It was obvious he was still adjusting to everything and it was strange to him how quickly I was adapting. I knew I couldn\u2019t tell him about Raven\u2019s plan to sabotage everything so I had to just play it cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. It\u2019s just...I finally feel...well...free. To really be myself.\u201d I said replying to him with a smile as I kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest thing to me was I was beginning to remember details of a life I never lived. I remember growing up in the same neighborhood and going to the same school, but all the details were now shifted around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other things that still took time for me to adjust with was this new body. It was far more sexual than ever. From the way I walked, sat, moved, and positioned myself. Everything was designed to maximize my sex appeal. It was like if I wasn\u2019t the sexiest woman in the room I wasn\u2019t happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrived at the Greek restaurant and had a wonderful quiet lunch together. It was simple and pure. It also didn\u2019t hurt that I kept getting stares from just about everyone there which ranged from \u201cwow!\u201d To \u201chow the hell did he get her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch we took a small walk around downtown. I needed a few more selfies for today and some local spots around town seemed to work nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe even bumped into a couple fans. Two young college girls who said they loved my pics and wanted to know my secrets for having the perfect body. I joked with them and took a couple photos together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later we met a couple more fans, a couple guys who wanted to take selfies with me. They were kinda creepy so I made it fast. It was something I didn\u2019t love doing but it was part of the gig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird getting used to all this new attention. I wasn\u2019t really ready for it but it was something I think I could used to. </span></div></div>",

Her face went bright red, when she realised that I was looking at her. I was puzzled, before I realised why she asked. She was checking to see if I liked her. I looked at Alice, really looking at her. Redhead, tiny and very cute. I felt my body reacting to Alice. As she tentatively asked for my card, I decided to test the waters. After all, I;m not really a straight woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, darling. This card is just right. I love your necklace by the way. It's almost as hot as you are!\" She giggled at that, blushing heavily, I could practically feel Will's desire at seeing me with this hottie.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ride back to the apartment was far too quick as the bag of risky clothes taunted me from my arms. up a couple of flights and through the door we were safe in my apartment once more and it was now the moment of truth. I looked to the bag in my arms with a defeated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at it this way, once you have a proper outfit we can't head out and start looking into whats happened.\" Will offered, doing his best to sound encouraging... but it was ruined by the bemused smile creeping onto his face. He was enjoying this... the jerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, there's got to be a proper outfit in here somewhere.\" I muttered in annoyance as I headed to my bedroom and shut the door. With a deep breath to steady myself I dumped the bag onto my bed and started sorting it out. Underwear first. The thong and g-string were immediately tossed to the side, I may be a woman for the moment but I had standards... there was a small voice that noted it would look with my pert little bottom but that voice was swiftly locked away. So the panties it was... It was both relieving and disturbing how comfortable they felt when I pulled them up. As skimpy as they were going to that from nothing at all felt nice. The Bra was next, with took a little bit of finagling to get on, but stubborn determination showed through. The cups held and lifted my modest bosom making it much more impressive on my petite frame. It was almost magic in a way, seeing that Michelle was likely even smaller in bust then I was considering this one felt just a little tight. I lost a few minutes to marveling at my enhanced curves before I could collect myself and continue... All the blouses were tight, low cut affairs so I put them on hold to see what would go with the available bottoms... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skirt or tighter smaller skirt. Oh the options... thanks Will.\" I grumbled tossing the mini skirt onto the shame pile with thongs. Sliding the skirt up my hips was a strange feeling, when it was settled it was ind of like wearing loose shorts but at the same time felt like i wasn't wearing anything. with the skimpy panties being the only thing covering me. It was a rush of embarrassment and just a little thrill as I moved around the room feeling the fabric brush against my hips and thigh, just long enough so not to flash. One bend and everyone behind me would get a good look... at least I'm short enough that it's not immediately in most people's eye level. there weren't many other positives I could think off. I'd just have to be extra careful... A nice black blouse rounded the outfit, presenting my newly enhanced cleavage while clinging to my curves. It would have to do. With a deep breath I stepped back out, staying barefoot for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta da.\" I said with a lack luster sigh. Will's bemused look fell away to something more shocked. Whatever teasing he had in mind seemingly lost as he stared openly much like he had when first entering the bathroom. Now not having the vulnerability of being naked it actually... felt kinda good.</span></div></div>",

It served him right for finding these options, and nothing I\u2019d normally be okay wearing. Well, sure, they had to be girl clothes what with the new body, but teasing slut clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt my question, Will briefly looked like he was going to stand up, and my heart started beating heavily in my chest. The idea that he might just...start doing things to me...it felt so exciting. But instead, Will looked away from me. \u201cI mean, obviously, dude. You\u2019re the exact dream girl I told you about last night. Plus, you look even sexier in those clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts, about what he might do if I kept pushing him further, were taking big effects. It felt like liquid lava was pumping through my veins, I felt like I was overheating, but not in a bad way. Absolutely overcome with lust, I bit my lip and did a twirl, knowing the lift would be enough for him to see my panties. \u201cWas that a question? Either I look sexier now than I did naked, or I don\u2019t. Which is it, Will? Or should I get naked again, so you can compare some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words were just pouring out of me, and when Will didn\u2019t say anything, I wanted to take it further. I stepped closer to him, easily within his reach. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Will? Dream girl got you all hot and bothered? Want to fuck my brains out? I bet you do.\u201d Some part of me was still thinking this was crazy. After all, I had been a guy just a day ago, and a straight one at that. But in that moment, the lust overtaking my body didn\u2019t care about any of that. I wanted to see what Will would do to me.</span></div></div>",

He was going to take me an-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIce Cold snapped my brain into the present<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn undignified squeak escaped my lips as a large cup of ice cold water poured over me, his firm hand keeping me from skipped out of the way. Forcing me to experience the whole cup. With gasping breath I glared up to him,shirt and skirt soaking wet and freezing. \"What the hell was that for?!\" my already high pitched voice twinged even higher in my indignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You back man?\" Will asked seriously. \"You were starting to scare me.\" his sober tone seemed to bring my mind back. what had I been trying to do. Had I really been trying get my best friend to jump me? What was wrong with me. I held my head and shook it, taking a deep shuddering breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, sorry. I don't know what came over me...\" I mutter, sounding a little afraid. The large hand on my shoulder now a warm, steadying feeling to keep me from breaking out in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we'll figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But um, you should probably change your clothes.\" he muttered turning his gaze away. I blinked looking down and seeing my bra showing clearing through the low cut shirt. I groaned and huffed before turning back around to the room I just left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I can find anything less skanky then this outfit..:\" I muttered mostly to myself, ignoring his low whistle... It took a few more minutes to towel off and change into another lowcut shirt and skirt. They were all so short it was hard to tell f this one was longer or even shorter then the previous. When I reentered the room this time we were both prepared. Though I could still feel the tinge of burning in my chest but I was able to repress it this time.</span></div></div>",

Where is he?\u201d He says pushing his way past him and up stairs to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then bursts through the door; suddenly the two of you find yourselves staring at your own bodies. Joey then walks through the door, \u201cWhat the Hell is going on here?!\u201d he asks, \u201cHe stole my body!\u201d she exclaims, \u201cHey wait, you think I wanted this!\u201d you exclaim, as the two of you start yelling back and forth, \u201cHEY!!\u201d Joey Exclaims, getting both of your attention, \u201cAaron, you\u2019re telling me that last night you passed out at your place and woke up here in Tina\u2019s body, and Tina when you got home you passed out and woke up in Aaron\u2019s body at his place?\u201d The two of you say yes, \u201cAnd yall didn\u2019t go to a Chinese antique shop, or shooting star, or genies or anything like that right?\u201d he says laughing, \u201cDude this isn\u2019t the time.\u201d You say, \u201cYeah this isn\u2019t funny!\u201d Tina Says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell too bad, because if it was something like that we would have some idea how to fix this, but if this was just a random supernatural phenomenon what can we do?\u201d He says still laughing to himself, \u201cWhat are you saying so we just have to wait and see what happens!?\u201d Tina says, while you walk over to the mirror staring in horror. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take another look, Tina\u2019s body felt so different from yours, you use to be 5\u201910\u201d and all muscle, but now you were four inches shorter. It felt so weird having long hair, back in college you had grown yours out a little but not like this. And you had always had a lean build, but with Tina\u2019s curves it felt like you were wearing an extra two or three layers of skin tight sweat pants. And you still couldn\u2019t get use to the two perky D-cups weighing your chest down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you always thought Tina had a great body, but this was a little too close for comfort. You think to yourself as you twist and turn in front of the mirror. Then you remembered why you had come up here, as you see yourself in your tight pink nightie. You still couldn\u2019t believe you were actually wearing something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and quickly take it off, but what you find underneath it was even more demeaning.

You searched through her entire closet and dresser and you couldn\u2019t find anything conservative. Nothing but short skirts, tight pants, and low cut tops, nothing but clothes to show off her figure. And when you went through her dresser you were horrified, she must have the entire Victoria secret catalog, or at least the most provocative, you were glad that she went with the nightie. You don\u2019t know what you would of done if you had woken up in any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you start to get worried, you had to get out of the thong but you couldn\u2019t just go commando, Joey would never let you live it down, who seems find this whole situation hilarious. Then when you had nearly given up, u manage discover a pair of regular panties, and to the right of them pajama pants. You didn\u2019t want to wear the panties but it was the lesser evil, so you quickly remove the thong, without looking down, it just felt weird since you didn\u2019t have anything down there anymore. As you pull the panties up you still felt degraded but it covered more than before, you then put on the pajama pants. It was a relief to finally be able to cover up you lower body, even if it still hugged your curves perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you attempt to remove the bra, normally you could remove a girl\u2019s bra without even thinking about it, but now that it was on you, it was a little more difficult. But eventually you got it off, as you stand there topless you couldn\u2019t help but look down, they might have been heavy, but they were perfect, naturally round and perky. But then when you remembered that they were on you, it was weird, if you had been looking at Tina from your own body, you would be drooling, but now it was embarrassing. You then find one of Joey\u2019s T-shirts to put on. You thought about looking for a pair of Joey\u2019s pants but one look in the mirror and you knew it was no point. Joey was tall and lean like you, well at least how you use to be; his baggiest pants probably wouldn\u2019t even make it over your hips,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look at yourself in the mirror again, the shirt was a little big so it went down to your mid thigh, covering way more than the nightie. And the pajama pants were comfy and a little baggy; you still couldn\u2019t believe that you actually found something that wasn\u2019t skin tight in her closet. It was impossible to hid Tina\u2019s amazing figure, and her breasts still looked amazing even with the T-shirt. But it was a major improvement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear Joey calling you from down stairs, \u201cHey come on its getting cold!\u201d he says, you take one last look in the mirror and figure this will do for now. You then leave the room and walk down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get down stairs\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you and Joey spent the afternoon watching movies, she was planning a very expensive trip, with your credit card. She had always had expensive tastes, and they had nearly cleaned Joey out. And even when she would work, the majority of her paycheck would go to clothes, jewelry, fancy restaurants, and other things she couldn\u2019t really afford. Luckily Joey managed to cut up her credit card a few weeks ago; unfortunately he was still paying off the bill. But now with unlimited access to your bank account, she was making up for lost time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since she didn\u2019t know how long the good times would last she decided to go all out with a luxury cruise. Two weeks of clear skies and sunshine, first class all the way. She had already bought everything she would need for the trip and requested next day delivery. She had finally decided all the details of her trip, where she was going, how long it would be for, what cabin she wanted, and then it came down to number of tickets. She had never been able to throw this kind of money around before and she didn\u2019t know if she ever would again. So she asked herself, did she want to go by herself of did she want to let one of her girlfriends in on the secret and bring them with her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: If you choose invite a friend.

She didn\u2019t have her phone, But she knew her number by heart, but she would still be hearing a guys voice, so maybe you could text her. Or she could try Facebook.

It felt amazing but just like looking at your new body there was something humiliating about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments you manage to quickly turn off the water, freeing yourself from the immobilizing sensation. You then take a moment to catch your breath, your heart was still racing and even though you could move stand there, dripping wet as your body recovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of the shower, slightly relieved to see that the mirror was fogged, protecting you from your reflection. You then grab a towel and begin drying off; you then wrap the towel around you at first you go to wrap it around your waist, you then look down to see your perfectly perky breasts on your chest and hang your head in shame remembering that you now had more to cover up. As you lift the towel to hide your breasts, but now the bottom of the towel barely covers your other butt. As you open the bathroom door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The expression on Tina's face changes quickly from sleepy to absolute shock.  You slam your hand to your mouth; Tina's reflection does likewise.  At that moment you realize two things: One, you haven't taken a breath in since seeing Tina in the mirror; and two, you ARE Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...wait a second, here, you say aloud.  You couldn't help noticing that you just heard Tina say the exact same thing you did.  Your feel your heart racing.  Instinctively, you put your left hand on your chest, but it doesn't make it.  Something blocked it.  Your hand stopped on Tina's left breast.  Your right hand had already found it's way to Tina's right breast.  You look down and see them, Tina's impressive breasts encase in a blue baby doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes return to the mirror where you scan Tina slowly from head to toe.  Her hair has a stylish, expensive cut with highlights; not bad for just waking up.  Her fingernails are manicured, which peeks your interest.  You glance past her impressive cleavage and catch a glimps at her toes.  Just as you suspected, her toes have the same expensive manicure treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" you said aloud as it became abundantly clear that Tina was a dreaded \"High Maintenance\" chick; those women you mocked and avoided and now, suddenly, you ARE one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze on the reflection moved past her tanned, toned legs and stop.  A small, triangular shaped price of satin is all that separates you and your new, current reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, than move your rich hand from your breast to blue, satin panties.  Your touch send lightning bolts up your spine; you shiver as goose-bumps race up and down your hairless arms and legs.  You light investigate the fabric.  It smoother than you would have expected.  Your fingers find their way to Tina's completely bare vagina.  You heart races, but you can't tell if it just horror or excitement.  You've always thought Tina was a knock-out and would have seen her clad in this little nothing any day; but this was hardly what you had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone stirs in the bed from which you awoke into this insane nightmare; your best friend.  You move quickly to the side of the bed nearest to your slumbering friend.  Your quick movements brought your new assets to the from of your mind as yor bounced in some areas and jiggled in others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, wake up,\" you whispered.  No response.<br>\r\nYou poke him with one of Tina's manicured nails.  \"DUDE,\" you said again in a half-whisper-half-shout.  He slowly open his eyes and smiles.  Whoa!  Did he just..?  Holy shit, your best has been awake for less then three seconds and he's already checking you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" he says in his groggy, precoffe morning voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'what' me, man.  What the HELL is this,\" you snap making a gesture to Tina's lingerie clad body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina, what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you don't know,\" I accuse the guy who once disassemble a professor's Mini Cooper in the faculty parking lot and reassembled it in her classroom; I should know, I helped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't.  But, Tina, if you want to talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT TINA!  It's me, Aaron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just sat there looking at you.  Did he think you were crazy?  You start thinking of was that you could prove it to him.

In fact, you encouraged Joey to talk to her because you thought she was so amazingly beautiful.  And now you find yourself in the body of that very girl, half naked sitting on your best friends bed.  The irony was palpable as you were partially responsible for Joey ending up this drop-dead gorgeous wreck of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new revelation you found yourself suddenly sympathetic to Joey.  He had saved your ass so many times.  You looked down at yourself again, taking in those amazing breast and gorgeous legs; and even from this perspective you couldn't see her best features.

He was committed at work and you couldn't help but notice how he began spending more and more time at the office.  It's funny that much of your fortune was due in large part to Joey's hard work and commitment, althought much of his dedication was just an excuse to avoid spending time with Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this part of your plan, to take me on your cruise instead of Tina,\" you asked without accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Joey replied.  \"I booked this trip a while ago.  I came across the spell on a recent trip I took with Tina.\"  Joey explained how they went to a bed-and-breakfast on Cape Cod two weeks ago.  While antique shopping Joey was investigating an old, oak roll-top desk.  Before deciding to buy it, he went through the draws to estimate potential storage space. It was in one of those draws where Joey came across several aged pieces of parchment; the parchment contained fading script in old-English.  Joey said that Tina  overruled the purchase of the desk; Joey never returned the parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in his room Joey read the fading script on the aged parchment.  To Joey, the writing appeared to be some kind of spell, specifically a hex to swap souls between two living creatures.  Joey said he knew immediately on whom he would test the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first I was just going to swap you with Tina long enough for you to sign divorce papers favoring me,\" Joey explained.   \"But then I thought since I had already booked this cruise and you could sign the divorce papers later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotcha, man,\" you say with renewed sympathy.  \"Oaky, so, how long is this cruise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put Tina's flawless face into her manicured hands and rub her, now your deep green eyes; as you rub your eyes you notice how incredibly long Tina's lashes are.  \"Fine,\" you say as you rub your temples.  You snap your head up, look him in the eye and point a manicured index finger at him, \"but don't even think about touching me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say...Tina,\" Joey said with a smirk.  \"Do you want to at least get dressed?  You're distracting me a little sitting there in that little nightie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself and nod, \"YOU'RE distracted?\"  You stand and walk to a dresser covered in feminine things.  You look through the drawers rifling through Tina's effects unable to even identify one article of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina keeps some work-out gear in the bottom draw,\" Joey says.  \"You may want to start there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the bottom draw and immediately identify yoga pants, a sports bra and some sort of tight fitting tee-shirt with a hoody; all three items still have price tags.  You glance at the price on one of the tags and gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, who pays that much for stretchy pants,\" you say with a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.  That's the cheap stuff.  Wait until you see how much she spends at the spa,\" Joey complained.  \"Tina can drop $1,000 in a matter of hours there...which reminds me, she booked a bunch of stuff for tomorrow to get ready for the cruise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time and how long,\" you ask after completely removing the blue nightie.  \"Shit, I need underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top draw,\" Joey said.  \"And she made her spa appointment for 11 tomorrow morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the top draw and find several pairs of panties, all of which are thongs.  You don't complain and grab a pair without discretion. You pull them up your smooth legs and adjust them into place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sports bra went on like a tee-shirt, but took forever to adjust and felt so tight.  You pull the yoga pants up your smooth legs and ample bottom.  You rub your hands over the fabric.  The black yoga pants had a shine to them as did the bra; a set perhaps.  You look at yourself in the mirror.  Like your reflection from earlier this morning, a gorgeous woman stares back at you, only this time she is wearing tight fitting yoga pants and top.  \"Wait,\" you think in a panic, \"do I have...camel toe!?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'll go get started on breakfast,\" Joey said finally breaking away from his gaze.  He turned and walked out of the bedroom leaving you alone for the first time in Tina's body.  Your hands massage your new butt, moving gracefully to your tight stomach, moving in circles over your ample breast.  You glance at the mirror as your hands retrace their previous paths in varying order.  You look deeply into Tina's angelic face.  \"If you were ever forced to be a chick,\" you thought to yourself, \"this is the one to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a blender and smell of coffee breaks your trance.  You turn towards the door and head for the kitchen.  Apparently, Tina was hungry...YOU were hungry.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sounds from the kitchen break you from the trance of staring at the knockout in yoga attire in the mirror.  You turn and head through the door and down the stairs; your recently acquired breasts bounce slightly in the athletic bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, this is going to get old,\" you say grabbing your breasts as you decent the final few steps.  You enter the kitchen and find Joey making an omelet.  A mystery drink sits blended and frothy in the mixer; it's green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're almost ready, Babe..,\" Joey caught himself in mid sentence.  \"Er, I mean, dude, can you grab a glass and a plate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let his \"Babe\" comment go as you rationalize that this is Joey's routine.  You grab a plate from the counter and a glass from the pained cupboard.  He turns from the cook-top with a tiny omelet and places it on your plate.  You say nothing as you watch him put an enormous omelet on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, for real,\" you ask looking at his plate and back at your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, that's how much she eats in the morning.  If you're still hungry I'll make some more.\"  Joey poured a portion of the frothy green liquid from the blender into your glass.  You stare at it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you'll love it,\" Joey said reading your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at the table and begin consuming your messily omelet and mystery drink.  Joey was right.  The drink, whatever it was, was amazing and the omelet was gourmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never cooked in college,\" you said.  \"When did you learn to cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being married to Tina forced me to learn how to do lots of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your omelet before Joey had a chance to take a bit.  He stared and watched you inhale the breakfast and pound the shake.  \"What,\" you ask feeling Joey's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.  It's just that I've never seen Tina eat like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a man,\" you say completing his sentence.  \"Never mind that.  Can I use your computer?  I wanted to try and move some money to keep Tina from taking my life's savings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey pointed to his laptop on the coffee table.  You leave your empty plate and glass on the table and walk to the couch next to the coffee table.  You locate the browser and begin navigating to your accounts. To your horror, Tina has already cleaned you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brokerage account, your money market, your IRA, all showing a balance of zero.  Your heart starts pounding and you can't breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She took it,\" you gasped.  \"She took everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\"  Joey walked over to the computer.  \"How could she take everything!? She's only been you for a couple of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively navigate to the history folder.  Your scroll down the list.  Clearly someone was searching financial institutions.  Then you read a familiar name that made your blood run cold.  Among the names and financial institutions was your accountant and financial planner, Ed Springer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, call Ed's cell.  Ask him if he's seen me today.  I mean me, not me.  I mean, ask if he's seen Aaron this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey picked up his smart phone from the counter and dialed the numbers as you said them.  He finished dialing and tried handing you the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not me.  He won't recognize my voice as Tina.  He'll recognize you.  You've used him before,\" you shouted in a whisper.  Joey put the phone to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hello.  Ed?  Yeah, hi.  It's Aaron's friend, Joey.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good....Yeah, hey listen, I'm trying to find Aaron.  Yeah.  Have you..?\"  Joey was quite as Ed spoke for several seconds.  \"Really?  This morning...?  Wow, everything?  No, I don't know if you upset him.  Another broker?  I don't know.  Yeah, if I see him I'll ask him to call you.  Thanks, Ed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey ended the call and stared at you; you swear he looked like he was about to cry.  \"I'm SO sorry, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, did you search these institutions and for Ed's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it wasn't your fault,\" you said in a surprisingly calm voice for someone who just lost everything.  You continued to scroll the browser history and discovered a search on a body swapping spell.  You select the search and the browser takes you to a sight with pictures of witches and pentagrams.  The sight is called \"Witches of Cape Cod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, did you search this,\" you ask Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said after a quick glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search within the site under a heading \"Curses and Spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, the spell you found in the desk at the antique shop on the Cape, where is it,\" you asked Joey keeping your eyes locked on the screen. Joey said nothing as he sprinted up the stairs into the bedroom.  He was gone for only a minute before he ran back to you as you sat on the couch.  You didn't need to wait for his return to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, she found the spell,\" Joey said out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must have assumed you were going to use it, or she decided to use it on her own,\" you deduced.  \"You may have not been the one that switched Tina and me after all.  SHE may have switched us!\"</span></div></div>",

You knew the first step was to attempt to locate Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, call my cell and home lines,\" you ordered.  You stood and walked to the kitchen where a set of keys lay on the counter.  The Audi keys where attached to a ring that secured several additional keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not picking up, dude,\" Joey said glancing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep trying,\" you said still examining the various keys.  \"Joey, are these your keys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're to Tina's S4. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer;; right now you only wanted to know to what door and lock every key on that ring belonged.  \"I'll start with the car,\" you thought aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey ended his attempts to call your phones. \"Everything keeps going to voice mail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voicemail!  Give me your phone,\" you said reaching your hand out to Joey.  Joey placed the phone into your manicured fingers.  After several attempts made difficult by your long nails, you successfully dialed your cell phone.  You waited until it went to voicemail, then you entered your pass code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two new messages...\" the auto-toned announcer said.  \"To get messages press...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the drill.

I was just following up on your letter regarding subletting your apartment.  I checked your lease and it appears you can indeed sublease your apartment.  I'll need your renter to fill out a form which I have at my office. Give me a call or stop by my office.  Thanks.  Sorry to see you go, Aaron.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End of message.  You have no more messages.  To replay your messages...\" you ended the call and handed the phone back to Joey.  Christine Jackley was your landlord, and you didn't recall sending her a letter regarding subletting your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, Tina's running,\" you said.  \"I think she may be skipping town.  We need to get to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll drive you,\" Joey said reaching for his keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your feet realizing you needed shoes.  Again you grab your breast as you find yourself traversing the stairs.  In the bedroom closet you find racks of Tina's shoes, few of which show any practicality at all.  The majority of the shoes and boots have heels and appear glitzy.  You found a pair of reasonable trainers.  You check the top drawer of Tina's dresser and find a pair of athletic socks.  You again decend the stairs, but this time, as you were carrying socks and shoes, you had no free hand to brace your bouncing breast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it to the garage carrying Tina's socks and trainers.  Joey had already backed his Range Rover onto the driveway.  You start walking to the Range Rover, but stop halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take Tina's Audi,\" you say firmly.  \"I can rummage through it while you drive.  By the way, where does Tina keep her purse?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I saw it hanging in the front hall closet,\" Joey answered as be began to pull the Range Rover back into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back inside and find the hall closet.  \"Bingo,\" you whisper as you grab the purse.  Not knowing anything about purses, you suspect it's expensive.  You read the brand \"Kate Spade\" on the side.  You return to the garage where Joey has already swapped cars and backed the Audi S4 onto the driveway.  He opened the door for you as you balance your socks, trainers and purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man,\" you say as you collapse into the front passenger seat.  \"All right, let's get to my place, fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey maneuvers the Audi through the neighborhood quickly.  You have both socks and shoes on by the time Joey reaches the highway.  You reach for the seat belt after you put on your shoes and a cold reality sets in as the seat belt pressed between your breasts.  \"Man this is uncomfortable,\" you think to yourself as you look down at your predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's see what this bitch has been up to,\" you mumble as you begin to search through her...</span></div></div>",

And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cold reality hits you, even worse than the seatbelt spreading your new breasts.  You slowly remove sevral plastic wrapped, bullet shaped tampons.  \"Oh, God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Joey kept his eyes on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, please tell me Tina isn't about to go on the rag...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit,\" he said glancing several times between your manicured hand holding three of the cotton bullets, the road, your face, back to your hand and then reacquiring the road.  \"Sorry, man.  I sure hope she, or you...have some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the tampons back.  \"Well, that's it.  Not clues, no cell phone.\"  You put the purse on the floor between your feet leaving the wallet on your lap.  You begin to rifle through the glove box only to find the usual collection of current and outdated registrations, and a repository of statements itemizing a long history of dutiful maintenance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to the console containing a pair of women's sunglasses and a hair scrunchie.  You take the scrunchie, pull your hair back and secure the scrunchie making a ponytail.  You then adorn the sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you said as you open her wallet.  \"She definitely covered her tracks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Tina's wallet there is a driver's license displaying a photo of a beautiful woman and an impressive collection of charge cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish she had been this committed to being a loving wife to me,\" Joey said as he pulled the Audi into the parking lot of your apartment.  Joey pulled into your usual parking spot.  Your car was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were out of the car before Joey killed the engine.  You began rubbing your breast.  \"Owe.  This is gonna get old really fast,\" you said to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slung Tina's purse over your shoulder and began walking towards your apartment, Joey had no trouble catching up to your as your gate was now half of what it was yesterday.  Your breasts bounced slightly as you walked and your wider hips made you walk like...well, like a chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Joey approached the door to your apartment, you're startled by a man kneeling at the open door changing the lock.  He pays not attention to you as you step over his kneeling legs and step into your apartment.  It's completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!?\" you call out, still uncomfortable with the femanmine sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!?\" Joey called out in a manly voice which seemed to mock your recently loss of masculinity. After a thorough walk through of the apartment, it's apparently empty. </span></div></div>",

You take them into your small hands and examine them.  In addition to the Audi key, three additional keys hang from the ring.<br>\r\n\"This one is the house key,\" he said pointed to the large, nickel colored key.  You separate the remaining two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This key reads '285,'\" you said holding up the smallest of the three keys.  Joey leans toward the key, lifts up his sunglasses and squints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's her gym key,\" he concludes.  \"She's a member at 'Your Style Fitness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joey reach the car.  Joey unlocked the car with the remote.  Before opening the door, glace back at the trunk.  \"Joey, pop the trunk, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trunk opens with an elongated beep.  You lift the boot and look inside; Joey is standing next to you.  The trunk holds only a gym bag.  You bend into the trunk, your breast hit the bottom edge of the trunk.  Fortunately you didn't notice Joey staring at your new ass as you lean into the trunk.  You pull the bag toward you and unzip it.  You find a roll pad, yoga shoes that look like harden slippers, towel, change of clothes and onepiece swimsuit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say with a siegh, \"want to hit the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really geared up for that,\" he said glancing at himself and then at you.  \"But, I'll hold in lobby while you check out the locker.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"  You slam the trunk closed and move to the right front seat.  \"We'll, there's at least one benefit being a chick: I can get into the women's locker room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later you and Joey are standing in the lobby of Your Style Fitness.  Tina's gym bag hangs over your right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tina,\" the receptionist cheerfully said upon seeing you.  \"You're a few minutes late, but I'm sure you can find space to roll out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...terrific,\" you reply unconvincingly. \"You take several steps toward the main fitness center.  \"Right, it's still in room...six?\" you blindly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Atrium Room,\" she said with a confused face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue walking and turn your head toward Joey.  You felt like a kids going to the first day of school.  You wander past several rooms until you come across a doorway labeled 'Atrium.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneak into a room crowded with women deeply engaged in their yoga session.  You find a small peice of real estate and roll out your mat.  You sit on the mat and attempt to mimic the movements of the other members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extend your legs and spread them appart.  You bend you torso and attempt to grab your right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you think as you effortlessly grasp your right foot.\"  In your previous body you found stretching difficult, but now it's easy.  As you stretch you notice your breast spread between your thigh; although, unlike the seatbelt, this is very comfortable.  In fact, it feels amazing.  You lift your head and gaze at the class.  The female instructor calmly gave some sort of instruction.  The class seemed to understand the instructor as they changed positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike your neighbors, you cross your legs, lift your arms above your head, touch the manicured fingers of your left hand with your right.  You then bend your torso from one side, hold, followed by the other side.  You breath deeply as you make the slow, methodical movements.  You glance down at your legs, your gaze travels to the area between your legs.  The yoga pants, stretched to their limits, encases Tina's, now your vagina.  The pants outline your prominent camel toe.  You find yourself getting warm between your legs and your heart rate was steadily increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is nice,\" you think.  \"What's wrong with me?  Why am I finding this so enjoyable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale and the instructor updates her instructions.  The class switches to the new position.  You mirror the movement again.  This continues for the next few minutes.  Each time you flex and bend you're stunned at your new found flexibility and grace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you're dripping in sweat.  You remove the hooded tee leaving you in just the sports bra.  You're comforted when you see other women wearing similar outfits. You look down often and admire your new, perky breasts, taught stomach and flawless skin.  You had to admit, Tina was striking-YOU were striking, and you were turning yourself on to the point that you were shaking.  Or, was it the workout?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the clock high on the wall.  It was 1:55 PM.  The time has flown since you started this.  You hoped Joey was occupying his time.  As you continue to move, flex and hold various positions your mind starts to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I in such a hurry to switch back?  This isn't that bad, is it?  I mean, I'm a chick, I know, But, Jesus!  I'm smoking hot and Joey seems to be taking it well.  Finding Tina will be difficult.  Even if I do find Tina, what if she doesn't want to switch back?  I need to find that spell.\"  You open one eye when you hear the instructor's voice.  The class adjusts to a new position; you quickly follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you think, \"this position is the best one yet.  Okay, so, maybe I could take a break from this search and just hang with Joey.  It would be just like college, exept I'm a smoking hot chick, and his WIFE no less.  But what is so great about my life as Aaron?  I mean, I was 36 years old and I'm pretty sure I peaked.  I have no wife, no kids, no girlfriend, my parents are both dead and my brother and I haven't spoken since Dad's funeral.  Tina is what?  Twenty-five, 26?  She's a college drop-out, but I can change that.  It's like a second chance.  A life mulligan, except I'm doing my do-over as a woman.  But, I hate to admit it, but it's kinda cool.\"  You look down at your new body.  \"These tits are amazing, I feel better right now than I have in years when I was a guy.  God, look how gorgeous my legs are.  And this stomach, it's better than anything I could come close to achieving as a guy.  With Tina's face and body and my mind, I could be unstoppable. I'm not looking towards having a period, but I'm tough.  How hard could it be...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron!\"  You open your eyes and look up to see Joey standing above you.  There are only a handful of students left in the classroom socializing as they slowly make their way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Joey.  I didn't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you check the locker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet?  I've been in the lobby for over and hour.  What have you been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, stretching,\" I replied with an innocent smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were enjoying yourself,\" Joey said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't know how to explain it,\" you said getting to your feet.  You roll up the pad and insert it into your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locker 285,\" Joey said handing you the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take it for his grip and exit the Atrium. You follow the signs to the women's locker room.  You pay no attention to the women in their various states of clothed and nakedness and come to locker 285.  You insert the key effortlessly.  There is no question the key has found its mate.  You twist and the locker door is freeed from the latch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the locker you find various toiletries, a towel, a pair of running shoes, lifting gloves and an onepiece running suit.  You are half tempted to try on the running suit just to see Tina's curvaceous body in the skin tight running suit.  It can wait.  You grab it and stuff it into your gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the locker room and see Joey standing impatiently near the entrance.  \"Well, what was in it,\" has asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Tina's toiletries,\" you replied.  You had no intention of telling Joey you snagged a skin tight running suit to check out your new body adorning the racy outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both begin walking to the lobby.  \"So, what was it like in there?  See any naked chicks,\" Joey asked with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, Joey, I didn't even look.\"  Joey looked at you with disappointment.  \"Dude,\" you said with with a bright smile, \"I can see a naked chick anytime I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey laughed and instinctively opened the lobby door for you. \"Why thanks, buddy,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what,\" he asked as he unlocked the Audi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, where to?\" Joey turned the ignition key and the Audi came to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze is steady through the windshield as you think.  Tina's, now your stomach growled.  You placed your small hand on your now, tight stomach.  \"I think I'm hungry, dude.  Let's grab a bite to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  What are you thinking,\" Joey said pulling out of the parking lot.  \"Feel like McGilley's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGilley's was a sports bar that made amazing, messy sandwiches.  It was also a frequent hang out of yours and Joey's.  \"Hell yeah,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey lucked out.  He pulled the S4 into a parking spot right in front of McGilley's.  You get out and wait for Joey as he feeds the meter.  He jogs to the door and opens it for you with one hand, whilst making and entry gesture with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walk instinctively to the booth that has the best view of the various games on the big screens.  Moments later your server approaches your table.  She's a brunette, with huge, blue eyes.  She appears young, younger than even you at Tina's youthful 25.  She rambles through the specials, but neither of you listen as you are both bewitched by her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we'll need a few minutes,\"'Joey said to her.  She smiled.  Turned.  And went to the next table.  She was almost out of ear shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow,\" you whisper to Joey.  \"She's really hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  If I wasn't married...\"  Joey trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're NOT married.  Not really, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at you and smiled.  \"Yeah, that's true.  Maybe before we leave I'll get her number.  You won't mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I may be stuck like this,\" you say gesturing at your gorgeousness, \"but, it's still me.  I say go for it.  Heck, maybe she's up for a threesome.\"  You glance over at Joey.  Your last comment, while a  just, made Joey think about the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze into Joey's face adorning a stupid grin, then glance down at the keys.  You reach your manicured hand across the table and pull the key toward you.  You carefully study the final key.  \"What do you think it goes to,\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Maybe a hardware store could tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour server, Wendy, came back to your table.  After taking your orders, you attempt to make eye contact and notice Wendy is looking down your hooded tee right into your sports bra.  She then looks at you, and, realizing she had just been busted checking you out, looked down at her note pad and scribbled.  \"Okay, I'll bring it right out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, you glance over your shoulder at Wendy's posterior.  \"Nice,\" you whisper.  You turn your head to Joey who is watching exactly what your were watching.  \"Holy shit, dude.  I think she's a lesbian.  I totally caught her checking out my tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Really!?\" Joey was skeptical.  \"I doubt it.  Although you do have nice tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a competition.  A little wager.  One hundred bucks says she comes home with me over you,\" you say offering your petite, manicured hand to Joey.</span></div></div>",

After he releases his vise-like grip you stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna hit the head.  Order me the special, will ya?\"  You walk to the restroom and instinctively enter the same men's room you've stumbled into countless of times before now; and usually much less sober.  You stop yourself before completely entering, turn on your cross-trainers and redirect yourself into the ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the awkward discomfort of using your new plumbing, you find yourself strolling back to the table.  You pass by a small register and computer screen where your server, Wendy, was itemizing a bill.  She glances up at you and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...boyfriend gave me your order,\" Wendy says with a cute smile.  You seize the opportunity to turn the odds of the bet in your favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're not a couple,\" you said returning her smile.  \"I'm actually not into that.\"  Wendy seemed to catch your implication and you walked back to your table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and look across the table at your best friend, then glance down at the table where Tina's key lay next to his glass of water.  You reach your manicured hand across the table, grasp the keys and bring them closer to you for examination. Joey continues to read the subtitles on the muted flat screen television tuned to ESPN Sports Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find out what this key goes to,\" you think aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I was thinking we could call Rick about it.\"  Rick Elliott was a fellow fraternity brother at the same university attended by both you an Joey; Rick now manages the local store of a national home improvement chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll swing by after lunch,\" Joey continued without taking his eyes from the screen as he studied the latest reports regarding college drafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon found yourself in a lively debate with Joey over draft selections when Wendy came to your table with your food.  After efficiently distributing your respective orders she left you to resume your debate with Joey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tore into your sandwich like you always do; however, after finishing less than half, you realize you were unable to eat another bite.  Tina's stomach was filled too quickly. You continued your discussion as you enviously watched Joey devour his food to the last bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Joey said looking as if he had had a major epiphany, \"I just realized...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're like the ideal chick.  I mean you can talk sports like a guy, eat food like a guy, but you have the body of a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A total hottie,\" you said completing his sentence.  \"Well, that may be, but let's fix this so I'm no longer this hottie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was standing next to you before you finished your sentence.  She smiled and placed the bill on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take that whenever you're ready,\" she said looking down as if embarrassed.  You watched her as she pulled a small card from her apron and handed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I don't know what you guys are doing tonight, but some friends and I are going to this club,\" she said pointing at the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the card which reads \"The Tower Club.\"  The address listed below indicated it was located in Belmont.  Wendy continued her sales pitch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saturdays are pretty cool.  There's no cover charge for girls if you wear a costume.\"  You look up at Wendy and meet her wet blue eyes which were already locked into yours.  As she speaks you catch her again glancing down at Tina's unnaturally perky, albeit impressive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay.  Thanks.\"  You watch Wendy smile optimistically, turn and walk away with an excited bounce to her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, dude,\" you say after you're sure Wendy is out of listening range.  \"Pay up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't qualify,\" Joey says as he pays the bill leaving enough cash for a generous tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about,\" you ask as you both stand and walk to the exit.  \"The bet was which one of us she would go out with.  She just asked me out,\" you insist holding up the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Joey said with a smile as you exited onto the street and walked to the car.  You climb into the Audi and engage the seatbelt.</span></div></div>",

As you and Joey walk toward the store's entrance, you are enraged as every single man walking out of the store unabashedly ogles you.  You enter the store and reach the customer service counter where Joey asked the representative if he could speak with Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Elliott you are requested at the customer service counter...Rick Elliott,\" the woman called over the public announcement.  In less than a minute your old buddy Rick was standing next to you and Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, Tina.  What brings you guys in today?\"  Rick tried to keep eye contact with Joey, but it was no use.  You knew how he felt about Tina because both you and he had many discussions about Tina's looks, among other things; the most recent discussion being the night of Joey and Tina's wedding.  You both agreed that despite Tina's beauty, you both felt Joey was making a mistake because she was such a bitch.  Now you watched Rick try as hard as he could to not eye f#%k Joey's wife right in front of him.  He was unsuccessful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, let's take a look,\" you hear Rick say as your concentration refocuses on the task at hand.  Rick holds the key in his hand and flips through a catalogue the size of a phone book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" Rick said pointing to an illustration of the exact key.  Several numbers further identifying the key were listed below the picture.  Rick looked closely at the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here is the batch number.\" Rick walked to a computer terminal and typed in several identifiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like this key is sold with the matching locking mechanism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sold to whom,\" Joey asked reading my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I don't know.  Anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick,\" Joey said with his all-bullshit-aside look, \"this is really important.  I need a name.  The name of the business, the company, whomever bought that lock and key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but it will take some time, and I probably will only be able to narrow it down to a list of businesses in the area; nothing too specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Rick.  That would be really great.  How long will it take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How soon do you need it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going on a vacation and will be back next Sunday,\" you chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a list ready for you by the time you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man,\" Joey said giving Rick a manly combination of a one handed shake and a loud slap on his the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick turned to you.  You panicked wondering what the appropriate farewell would be; you settled for a hug.  As he hugged you back, you couldn't help noticing how much your breasts were smashing into his torso.  Rick released you and you stepped back to Joey's side.  Both of you turned and walked to the Audi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to now,\" Joey asked as he exited the parking lot and drove toward the parkway</span></div></div>",

I'd like to take a shower.\"  You didn't see Joey smile at the thought of you taking a hot shower in Tina's delectable body.  You just wanted to clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey pulled into the driveway and killed the motor.  You grabbed Tina's purse and walked inside, ascended the stairs and entered the bedroom with the adjoining bathroom.  You turned the water on the hottest setting and begin to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you're completely naked you walk to the fogging mirror and stare at your reflection.  It was beyond impressive.  You could only imagine how easy life must be for someone with such breathtaking looks.  Then again, you have just experienced what it was like for less than a day and you're exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the mirror has fogged beyond use.  You stepped into the shower and it feels as though you are showering for the first time.  As the water cascades down your recently acquired voluptuous curves, your body tingles with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly run your delicate hands over every inch of Tina's body as your breath becomes labored and accelerated.  Your hands gently massage Tina's breasts which serves only to increase your sexual appetite. Your hands find their way down between Tina's legs.  Your manicured nails probe for Tina's clitoris.  After finding it, almost an hour passes before you find the will power to let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly wash your hair and body and stumble out of the shower.  Your grasp a towel and gently dry yourself off.  You look down at Tina's body, embarrassed for what you had just done for the better part of an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good shower,\" Joey asked with a grin as he laid on the bed waiting for you to exit the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you replied nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because you were in there for over an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to your friend and drop the towel exposing Tina's body in all of its glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do expect, man!?\"  You don't know why, but you start crying.  \"I didn't ask for this.  I didn't ask to have tits!  I just want to go back to being me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out man,\" Joey says with regret, \"I didn't mean anything by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bend down and recover the towel from the floor and regain your dignity.  \"I'm sorry, Joey,\" you said still crying a little, \"it's just...it's just...well, I just pleasured myself in your wife's body and I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey starts laughing. \"It's okay, man. It's only natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Joey said still chuckling.  \"I figured you would at some point.  Hell, you should try the massager.  Tina loves that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I will sometime,\" you replied now fully recovered from your sobbing.  You were grateful Joey was so cool about what you had just done.  Undoubtably you were going to do it again; maybe you would use the massager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do about this?\"  Joey was holding the card Wendy gave you listing the location of the club called TheTower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know.  I'm kind of tired,\" you lied.  Truthfully, you hadn't felt more invigorated in a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Could be cool.  And besides, Wendy's hoping you'll show.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could hear Joey as he rummaged through the hall closet and returned with a large cardboard box.  He rested the box on the bench at the foot of bed and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were out of town for Halloween last year, but I think she still has her costume from two years ago.  You remember?  You were at the same party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need Joey to continue his attempt at jogging your memory.  You remember all too well.  Tina was wearing a black, skin tight, shiny catsuit with sexy little cat ears and a long, furry tail.  Her eyes were also done up so they looked amazingly sexy with thick lashes and blacked out eyes.  You remember how difficult it was that night to hide your excitement and reactionary enthusiasm.  You also remember Tina totaling flirting that night, like she knew she was the wet dream of every guy at that party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Joey.  I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here it is, \" Joey was elbows deep into the box when he pulled out the catsuit, ears and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey,\" you said still standing in nothing but the damp towel, \"I don't really think that will work.  Besides, that night two years ago Tina had fancy make-up and all that crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey laughed. \"Ha, I see you DO remember that night.  Well, I remember lots of things from that night too.  Like, I remember Tina totally flirting with all of the guys at that party.  I remember going home with her that night thinking she was going to give me a little thrill after we got home since I'd been turned on for hours and she just undressed, jumped in the shower, washed all of that fancy make-up off and went to bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now realized what Tina was doing that night at the Halloween party two years ago.  She didn't go to have fun or celebrate All Hallows' Eve, but rather she went to that party to hurt your best friend.  The more you thought about it, the more your blood boiled.  And now, here was your best friend trying to get a little closure after Tina tortured him by asking you to put on the damn thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the make-up?  I don't know how to do any of that shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had one of her friends, who's a make-up artist, do it for her.  I remember it took her like two hours,\" Joey said, \"and then she just washed it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart was aching for your friend.  As much as it pained you to wear the slutty costume only hours following your rude awakening into womanhood, you wanted Joey to stop hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know the friends name,\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was in Tina's phone, which isn't here, but it may have been synced with her computer.\"  Joey walked out of the bedroom and returned with a laptop.  After scrolling through Tina's contacts, Joey piped up.  \"Here it is.  Heather Wichar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey dialed the number on his smart phone and waited for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?  Heather? Hi, it's Joey, Tina's husband.  Yes. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tuned into Joey's conversation as you crept closer to the shiny catsuit, which appeared to have claimed more than one victim the only night it was deployed.  You gently picked it up. It had no shape and appeared to be just a heap of shiny material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great.  We'll see you then.  Thanks, Heather.\"  Joey hung up the phone and spoke with enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just finished up with a photo shoot and said she could stop by on her way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were committed now.  You dropped the catsuit and walked over to Tina's dresser where you locate a second pair of yoga pants and some sort of teeshirt that appeared to have a bra built into it.  To pulled up the snug yoga pants and threaded the teeshirt over your head and manipulated Tina's generous breasts into the built-in cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing, you laid down on the king size bed and relaxed while analyzing your situation. There were no leads to follow until Rick Elliott gave you a list of businesses which may have purchased the batch number that included Tina's key.  This meant that you were unequivocally joining Joey on the cruise, which, admittedly, sounded like fun; even if it meant you would be wearing a bikini.  Then there was the club tonight and this Heather chick would be here in an hour. As for Sunday, Joey said something about the spa; your flight to Miami was Monday morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran through the remaining weekend schedule, you didn't realize you had already fallen asleep.</span></div></div>",

The small chapel sat quietly between a nondescript pond shop and a low-end casino on the north side of Las Vegas Blvd.  The chapel, decorated in an antiquated Elvis motif, severed as a sanctuary for fugitive couples absconding from over-the-top traditional weddings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the chapel, Tina stood at the alter staring into the eyes of the woman whom had been her best friend for almost two decades.  Tina had met Chloe in the second grade and they were inseparable ever since.  Tina wanted dearly to ask Chloe to be her maid of honor at the wedding,  but her mother insisted she ask her step-sister, Mary Kate, whom she knew very little; what Tina did know about Mary Kate she didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina remembered how heartbroken Chloe was at the wedding.  Chloe, whom was not blessed the the striking looks that Tina had been, cried uncontrollably convinced she would never meet someone because all guys cared about were looks.  Chloe howled that she was also loosing her best friend and that inevitable loneliness was to follow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina's heart ached that night.  Unfortunately for Joey, he misinterpreted Tina's apparent disinterest in him that first night of their honeymoon for a woman so cruel as to deny him the pleasure of consummating their marriage, rather than a woman who was too tortured by her friend's suffering to be able to perform in the bedroom.  Joey and Tina's marriage never recovered from that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, Tina stood at the alter in the body of a tall, strong, independently wealthy businessman about to marry the friend she had loved since she was six.  While Tina felt guilt over stealing the body and fortune of her husband's best friend and business partner, the spell she had discovered, which Joey mysteriously had brought back from Cape Cod, created an opportunity that was just too perfect.  Now, Tina could ensure Chloe would marry a man worthy of her kindness and she could escape the guilt from admittedly treating Joey so poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina had only been in the body of a man for one day, but had already adjusted to the advantages.  Aside from the larger, more intimidating size, Tina appreciated the respect her new body demanded from strangers.  In her new form, people accommodated her not because of lustful desires to win the appreciation of an attractive woman, or to have another reason to stare down her shirt to see her impressively round and perky breasts, but because she was a man of size, direction and means to which others seemed to know and respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the advantages of the immediate respect from strangers, Tina looked forward to being the ideal husband; at least her ideal.  Tina would take Chloe shopping, to the theater, clean up after herself and compliment Chloe every chance she had.  It was almost too perfect</span></div></div>",

You find the cable box revealing you had been asleep for more than two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  She's downstairs.  She's here to do your make-up,\" Joey said as he gently grasped your small arm to assist your attempt to stand.  You rub your eyes as you descend  the stairs to the entry hall where an edgy looking woman watches your every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sleepy,\" Heather says with a smile.  After the last step you find yourself looking into the deep brown eyes of a woman you would have guessed was an artist, in one form or another.  Heather's face is adored with dynamic make-up emphasizing her large lips and bright eyes.  Her jet black hair is buzzed short on one side and just below her ear on the other.  She wears a large stainless stud through her right nostril and a collection of loops and studs lined the top of her left ear down to the lobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a black teeshirt adorned with a graphic from a heavy metal rock band.  Her skirt looked as if it were straight from Catholic school, except for the shapely legs protruding from under the pleats clad in ripped fishnet stockings.  Her feet and calves were encased in large, black patent boots with large buckles stacked along the entire shaft ending at the five inch thick sole.  Heather was, undoubtably, radical; and yet so stylish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather opens her arms and embraces you.  You can't help smiling as her breasts press firmly against your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" she says as she embraces you, \"I haven't seen you in, like, forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather released you and you quickly reacquire her caring brown eyes.  \"What do you guys have going on?\"  Heather turned and reached down to her case, which appeared to be a small trunk with handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're just hitting the club tonight,\" Joey said standing on the bottom step.  \"We thought we'd play it cheap and get Tina in for free by dressing her up in a costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\"  Heather looked at her men's G-Shock wrist watch weighing down her rail-thin arm.  \"How much time do we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd probably like to leave here around 9:00 at the latest,\" Joey said glancing at his Rolex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we can do that.  What are we going for?  What costume are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was kind of short notice,\" Joey said feeling compelled to justify the selection of costume, \"so we thought we'd just go with the costume she wore two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what costume was that?  I can't...I'm sorry, I don't remember.\"  Clearly Heather's creation two years ago last Halloween was not quite the life altering event it had been for Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went as a cat,\" Joey said trying to hide his emotions.  \"So, I don't know how much time you need...for...Will that?  Will that work?\"  You hadn't seen Joey this nervous in a long time.  Jesus, Joey, pull it together, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather didn't seem to pick up on Joey's deeply routed issues with Tina's costume selection from a Halloween two years ago.  Instead she just walked into the kitchen, placed her case on the counter and opened it.  You and Joey followed her into the kitchen and watced her as she organized her brushes and tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you'll need to change,\" Heather said quickly glancing at your attire of yoga pants and baby doll teeshirt.  She noticed you standing there with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You mean, I have to put on the costume?\"  You were dreading pulling on the skin tight catsuit, but you knew it was inevitable as you were damn sure you were going to prove to Joey that you had won your earlier bet on which of you would hook up with your server from lunch; and of course, it was hopefully going to give Joey a little therapy with an issue for which he clearly needed therapy.  But if slinking around in the clingy outfit was enough to make you Joey's Dr. Phil, than it was the least you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to,\" Heather said without diverting her attention from her assembly of her various containers of make-up,  \"but, I don't want the make-up to smear when you change.  You could put on a robe or something, anything you don't have to pull over your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say as you turn to walk up to the bedroom and search for a robe.  A minute later you find Tina's robe hanging on a hook on the back of her closet door.  After you completely undress, you wrap yourself in the pink satin rob and tie the sash tightly around your waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later you are sitting at the kitchen table, Heather sits across from from you tickling your face with various brushes.  You can't help but smile as the brushes tickle your sensitive face.  You find the entire experience most agreeable.  Heather keeps conversation to a minimum to keep you from having to speak.  For almost an hour you sat like a statue as Heather attempted to recreate her masterpiece from two years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, something like this,\" Heather asked Joey who stood up from the couch where he was catching the latest news headlines.  You had no mirror and could only imagine what you looked like.  You found it telling that Heather asked Joey for his approval, as if he was clearly the beneficiary of her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Joey said hesitantly.  \"But, last time you went heavier on the eyes and the lashes were a lot...thicker.  Heavier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather went back to her efforts to recreate the look.  Several minutes passed and Heather again called to Joey for approval.  His response this time was much more enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" Joey said with approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I started to remember a few things I did previously.  What were you going to do about your hair,\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you answered honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a few minutes before 9:00,\" Heather said as she again consulted her oversized watch.  \"Do you want me to help you?  I think I remember helping you work your hair into the cat ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great,\" Joey said with growing enthusiasm.  \"I'll go get them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And her straightener,\" Heather hollered as Joey sprinted up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, he's excited,\" Heather whispered as she continued to touch up her masterpiece.  \"I'm surprised he wanted you to wear your cat costume again after that party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean,\" you asked through your teeth attempting not to move any part of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember?  Last time you asked me to make you look really sexy because you had bought this super slutty cat costume and you were going to totally piss him off by flirting with other guys and shut Joey down after getting him all turned on.  You don't remember that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Sounds mean, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what you were going for: sexy and mean.  I guess it didn't work though because he seems all too eager for you to do it again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Heather's whisper became even more quiet, \"how are things between you two.  You guys still talking about splitting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anytime soon,\" you said coming to the defense of your best buddy.  \"I think I was just being an absolute bitch.  I'm just going to try to be a lot nicer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather didn't know what to say.  \"Good,\" was all she could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey returned with the headband adorned with two small, fury cat ears in one hand and the hair straightener in the other. Heather plugged the straightener into the socket under the counter and began styling your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a little tricky,\" Heather said as she stood behind you to work on your hair, \"your hair was longer last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help smiling as Heather continuously pulled your head by the hair against her chest.  You found yourself fairly aroused after receiving the make-over and now a hair styling; yet the arousal felt more relaxing than stimulating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Heather said finally, \"I think that should do it.  Joey, do you want to come take a look at your sexy wife and let me know if this works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Joey said quietly, \"Yup, that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it,\" Heather asked as she checked her watch a third time.  \"9:20.  A little late, but I think it turned out okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much for coming over, Heather,\" Joey said as you stood.  \"Aaron, why don't you go finish getting ready.  I'll settle up with Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron?\"  Heather had a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's just a nickname I call her,\" Joey said unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked Heather with a hug, careful not to smear your make-up.  As you climbed the stairs you overheard Joey insist paying Heather her standard rate.  You closed the door and walked quickly to the full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped at your reflection after seeing yourself for the first time after Heather had worked her magic. You had never seen a more alluring face.  Your eyelashes were thick and black, your eyes were flawlessly smoked and lined creating the appearance of the ideal sex kitten.  The cat ears sat flirtatiously atop your head intertwined carefully with your meticulously styled hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at your gorgeous face you drop the satin robe and take in the delectable body.  The combination of Tina's body and sexy kitten make-up pushes you dangerously close toward sensory overload.  You somehow find the willpower to break away from the mirror and find the shiny catsuit laying on the bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watch yourself in the mirror and enjoy the show of Joey's impossibly gorgeous wife squeezing into a skin tight catsuit.  You pulled the suit up over your generous backside where the long, furry tail protrudes from the catsuit.  Your small hands find their way through the ends of the sleeves followed by your shoulders.  You reached behind your and discovered you cannot reach the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey,\" you hollered through the closed bedroom door.  Joey walked into the bedroom and stopped dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, I can't reach the zipper.  You're going to have to get it for me,\" you said to him.<br>\r\nJoey didn't move.  He just stood there and admired the alluring image of his wife exhibited in the delicious catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey!\"  You shouted to bring him back from wherever he had just been, mentally.  \"I need you to zip this up.  You okay, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Joey replied before he took several steps to reach the zipper and began pulling it up your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait,\" you pleaded as you adjusted Tina's breasts in the catsuit.  You held them in place and gave Joey the okay.  \"Alright, zip it slowly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey slowly pulled the zipper up your back.  The catsuit squeezed Tina's breast into place with increasing pressure until the zipper reached its end.  You made a little adjustment and your new breast settled comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adjusting your breasts you bring your gaze back to the mirror.  You're stunned at the reflection which was so provocative, you almost couldn't stand looking at it.  Joey, like you, is speechless as you both stare at the feline fatale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get going,\" Joey said breaking the silence.  \"You should probably get some shoes.\"  Joey walked into the closet while you continued to stare at the enchantress looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try these,\" Joey came out of the closet with a pair of shiny, synthetic, patent boots with a high heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy, I can't wear heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  These are the boots she wore with the costume last time, but it you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, dude,\" you cut Joey off an took the boots from him.  You sat down on the bench, having to move the tail and unzip the shiny boots.  You inserted your small foot into the the bottom of the boot.  After your foot was settled you muscled the zipper up the length of the shaft; you performed the same task with the other boot.  Once both boots were zipped you attempted to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wobbled uncontrollably at first.  You regained your composure and gingerly walked to the mirror.  Again you take in the reflection of Tina in the haunting costume.  You conclude that Tina looks even more sexually enticing wearing the catsuit and heels than when she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You good?\"  Joey's excitement was beyond his ability to conceal it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you replied.  \"You turned carefully on your heels and walked gingerly towards the stairs.  Joey walked next to you.  You clung to his arm as you carefully descend the stairs in the heels and into the garage.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joey abandoned you momentarily and grabbed the keys to his Range Rover.  He unlocked it and opened the passenger door.  You tip toe to the door and make your way to the passenger seat.  Again you adjust your tail before reaching for the seatbelt.  Joey opens the driver side door and  settles into the driver seat.  He pressed the ignition and the Rover roared to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed out of the driveway and maneuvered toward the parkway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, man,\" you laughed breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" Joey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at Tina's body clad in the proactive, shiny black catsuit.  You pull down the visor, open the mirror and examine the flawless makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I agreed to this.  Jesus, no wonder you were so pissed off that Tina didn't give you a little after seeing her prance around like this all night.\"  You recall your discussion with Heather.  \"And by the way, Heather said Tina told her she planned on torturing you that night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't surprise me,\" he said without taking his eyes off the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving for half an hour, Joey slowly rolls past the club where a long line has formed wrapping around the corner to the other side.  To your relief, you identify other women in line wearing various costumes which, like yours, appear to me more lingerie than costume.  Joey spots a valet near the entrance and vectors towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey came to a stop and spoke briefly to the valet.  After explaining his expectations to the valet and undoubtably slipping him a generous tip, Joey double-timed to your door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show time,\" you say to yourself as you take a deep breath.  You quickly scan the scene and you're immediately horrified; it seems every eye is on you.  You gently slip off the leather seat and put your weight onto the heels of the boots.  You grasp Joey's arm and pull as much of your body weight off your heels as you can while walking slowly towards the entrance.  Joey had no intention of standing in line; that was for college aged nobodies who had yet to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the people in line that appeared to not notice a thing in the world except the seductive catwoman slinking directly into the club with no intention of queuing.    You didn't notice if Joey slipped the gatekeeper any money before letting you in, although you strongly suspected he had done so, generously; so much for dressing in a costume to save money on the cover charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crossing the threshold you are overwhelmed by the heavy thumping that rattles you in your heels as the music reverberates throughout the club.  Like all clubs, the lighting is almost nonexistent save for several low energy fluorescent bulbs placed in various positions near the floor.  Several chairs and love seats surround various tables; tall tables and high chairs lined the perimeter if the club.  The center of the club consists of a densely populated dance floor where various degrees of talent were displayed in a rhythmic tide of movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's this girlfriend of yours,\" Joey shouts above the music into your ear.  You and Joey circle the dance floor in search of a table.  You continue to cling to Joey's arm  not only for balance, but because you feel incredibly vulnerable as you scan the club only to find what seems like every man staring lustfully at you.  You took little offense after reasoning you would had gazed upon Tina with the same lustful eyes had you seen her dressed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to sit down,\" Joey gestures to a single lounge chair in a crowded arrangement of chairs and a couch surrounding a coffee table covered with mirrored tiles.  Four men and a young woman wearing an angle costume sit with their eyes glued on Tina's voluptuous body extenuated by the catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sit down, I'll take the arm,\" you reasoned since Tina's body was significantly smaller than Joey's it was easier for him to take the chair.  Joey collapsed into the chair while you sidesaddle the chairs arm.  The strangers across from you had been unable to release their fixation of you.  One of the young men, who was smaller than the others, with hair cut closely in buzz cut, wearing torn jeans and boots that were unnecessarily large shouted something to you over the pulsating music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" you shouted back not clearly hearing what he had shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I like your costume,\" he shouted more clearly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks,\" you replied self-consciously. The man, like his friends, appeared to be enjoying the new vision you provided them, perhaps a little too much.  The angel just sat quietly and looked a little annoyed.  The short man stood and walked closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if I have my picture with you,\" he asked looking at Joey this time to seek his approval as well.  You looked at Joey and he he smiled as if you both knew exactly why he wanted a picture with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you replied loudly while rolling your eyes.  The man gave his smart phone to his buddy and then took a kneeling position next to you as you sat on the edge of the armchair.  You looked at the smart phone and waited for a flash signaling an end to the awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he shouted as he walked back over to his friends.  After recovering his phone he appeared to navigate to his photo album and examined the picture of him kneeling next to the embodiment of his wet dream.  He smiled and looked back at you giving a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you,\" he mouthed with his thumb in the air.  Then he and his friends stood and moved away to a different area of the club too embarrassed to continue to sit next the woman he so openly admitted to lusting over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you said in Joey's ear with a smile,\" I wonder what he'll be using that photo for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey smiled and made a fist, moving it bake and forth in the air simulating the motions of a man jerking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's move over to the couch,\" Joey said taking the recently vacated love seat.  You made the switch and you were relieved to no longer be on display, feeling somewhat hidden within the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA server dressed as a cheerleader walked to the couch and stood over you and Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I take your order,\" she asked loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes,  you thought.  That's what I need, a little alcohol to help me feel less self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack n' Diet Coke, \" you replied.  Joey ordered a beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server returned shortly with your drinks.  You took several quick gulps in hopes it would relax you.  It seemed to be working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy,  man,\" Joey admonished, \"you're not a 200 pound man anymore.\"  You smiled and continued to aggressively sip the liquid courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's this girlfriend of yours?\"  Joey looked around the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\"  you replied enjoying how quickly you felt a buzz in Tina's body.  You were completely unaware that you were swaying back and forth to the pulsating music as you sat curled up in the love seat.  The server returned and collected your empty glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get another one of these,\" you asked just below a shout.  The server nodded and  smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you heard someone shout just over the rhythmic beat.  You turn your head and locate the source of the shout.  You immediately lock eyes with Wendy who is dressed in a light blue genie costume; she's standing at a high table with three or four other women.  She waves at you and abandons the table to walk toward you and Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" she yelled as she stood in front of you and Joey. \"I can't believe you came.  You look amazing!\"  Wendy's costume displays her beautiful, tan complexion and her taught stomach.  Her transparent, puffy genie pants give you a slightly obscured view of her shapely legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you shouted back, \"so do you.\"  You move over closer to Joey allowing Wendy room to sit next to you.  She takes advantage of the space and sits next to you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You make such a sexy cat.\"  Wendy's fingertips stroked your left arm.  She gently touches your tail and examines your cat ears.  \"These are adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said with a smile.  As Wendy continues to grope and compliment you, a tingling sensations overcomes you and a growing fire seems to radiate between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader server returns with a fresh Jack and Diet Coke.  You thank her and immediately attack the drink, each sip becoming easier to swallow than the last.  You have always been a pretty good judge of how much alcohol you can handle, but even you have to admit that at this point, you're blitzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your story,\" Wendy asked pointing at you and then Joey.  \"Are you guys married or..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorta,\" you slurred putting your hand on Joey's leg.  \"You see, I'm his best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey watched in amazement as the alcohol acted as a truth serum which you were far from accustomed to as a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Wendy decided to humor the sexy yet inebriated feline.  Joey sat back and smiled as if enjoying an inevitable train wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm not a woman,\" you confessed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"  Wendy looked Tina's body clad in the impossibly sexy catsuit, \"because you sure look like a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  No...Tina...Tina is a woman.  A very beautiful woman, too.  And, she's a BITCH!\"  You turn to Joey to apologize for calling his wife such a horrible thing.  For some reason, Joey was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is,\" you say directly to Joey's face.  You are confused why he continues to laugh at you.  You turn your attention back to Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this morning, I woke up an now...and now...now I'm a catwoman,\" you said.  You're confused because Joey and Wendy are laughing hysterically and you don't understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you guys...get it?!  I didn't want to be catwoman,\" you continue in vain to explain your situation to...what...?what was her name? The Genie woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I had to, I had to be the catwoman because my best friend here,\" you shout as you pound your delicate hand onto his leg.  Joey is suffocating from laughter and Wendy's eyes begin tearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My best buddy wanted the catwoman, but she wouldn't let him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stopped laughing long enough to move in closer to you.  Her face is just inches from yours and you see tears in her eyes.  She's crying?  The genie woman is crying because the catwoman was so mean to Joey.  You watch as the beautiful genie woman leans in to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips lock and your hands find their way to the genie's back.  You continue to vigorously kiss the genie and your manicured hands sneak into the elastic waste band of the genie's pants.  The genie's hands thoroughly explore your every inch of the catsuit and soon find their way down to your crotch as the music pounds your eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift your weight and climb on top of the genie and resume exploring her lips and neck with your lips.  You're lost in euphoria and can't recall ever feeling this full of life before.  You realize you love this genie, whoever she is.  Wait, where are you again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the music impulses seem to be absorbed by your body, you straddle the alluring genie and you begin to grind yourself on her.  Your erratic movements bring you to nirvana with each grinding motion.  The genie reciprocates your thrusts and you proceed to kiss every part of her shoulders, neck and face.  You loose track of time and are completely unaware as clubers stop and stare lustfully at the adorable genie and seductive cat making out and gyrating on the love seat next to Joey.  Joey begs the gods to let the moment last forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning (or was it afternoon) you opened your eyes.  The sun shined brightly through Joey and Tina's window.  You slowly sat upright and groaned as your head pounded.  You sat on the edge of the bed and noticed the weight on your chest.  This was the second morning you awoke as a woman.  This time, however, you know who you were and where you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the events from yesterday.  The trail to find your body and money, your apartment (no longer yours), the gym, yoga, lunch at the pub, Heather and the make-up, the catsuit, the club...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" you mumbled as you recall through the fog that is your memory of how smashed you were at the club and that you can't remember what you did there.  You look down at yourself noticing you are no longer wearing the catsuit.  You slowly stand and drag yourself to the bathroom as you examine the oversized teeshirt and gym shorts draped over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble to the toilet and immediately sit before falling over from your spinning head.  You sat quietly in the dark for several minutes before gathering enough strength to travers the large tiles to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the sink and look into the mirror.  You notice your face has been washed clean of any evidence of Heather's workmanship.  You continue to stare at your reflection and are amazed that even hung over and with no make-up, Tina's face is still extremely attractive.  You reach for a tooth brush and vigorously scrub every area of your mouth.  As you complete the second scrubbing you hear the high-pitched whine of the blender signaling Joey's dutiful breakfast preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God bless you, Joey,\" you pray aloud and slowly make your way to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tina's breasts bounced with every step of your decent.  Tina's nose guided you toward the kitchen where Joey was furiously preparing breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" you said to your best friend announcing your arrival.  You wasted no time putting Tina's shapely bottom on the nearest of the four stools at the kitchen counter.  A plate and utensils lay arranged carefully in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward allowing you to see past Tina's ample breasts and notice the great care Joey had taken with the table settings. Two forks rested from smallest to largest to the left of the large, square plate.  Likewise, a knife sat to the right of the plate next to a spoon; both were placed on a meticulously folded, white, linen napkin.  Perfectly centered in the square plate rested a deep bowl, which, like the plate, was shaped like a square. The bowl contained a collection of berries topped with a small amount of either cream or yogurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at Joey whom would not be distracted from whatever he was composing.  You tuned your head making a quick sweep of the kitchen and immediately noticed there was no table setting for Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you already ate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Joey replied as he placed the familiar green, frothy smoothie next to your plate.  \"It's 11:00,\" he glanced at his Rolex, \"I've been up since 8:00.  I drove Wendy home a couple of hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy,\" you said quizzically after stabbing an enticing strawberry with the smaller of the two forks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said surprised that you couldn't remember.  \"Your girlfriend from the club.\"  There was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The genie..?\" Joey said forcing your fogged memory to make a connection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" you finally recalled with a mouth full of berries.  \"How is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey placed a champaign glass next to your smoothie filled with what looked liked orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasped it with Tina's delicate hands and brought it to her plump lips.  You took a small sip. Mimosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She came home with us,\" you asked as the champaign seemed to immediately defuse your headache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She came home with YOU,\" he said. \"That reminds me,\" Joey retrieved his wallet from the back pocket of his jeans and found a one hundred dollar bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right, man,\" he said as he placed the note next to your mimosa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can't really remember last night,\" you admitted as you finished the last berry.  Joey saw you had finished the berries and replaced the empty bowl <br>\r\non your plate with a gourmet omelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou armed yourself with the remaining fork and attacked the carefully crafted folds of egg and vegetable.  Undoubtably, Joey had skills.  You thought for a moments as you shoveled the masterpiece into Tina's mouth and concluded you could get used to this...At least Joey making you breakfast, not the tits and plump ass; although even that wasn't too terrible, you reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey finished cleaning the kitchen and stood leaning against the counter watching you eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you're still you,\" he smiled watching you devour breakfast in a manner more closely resembling his old buddy, Aaron, than his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm hungry,\" you defended yourself with your mouth full from the last bite of omelet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After last night, I can see why,\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said pausing long enough to chase down your last bite of omelet with a gulp of mimosa, \"what happened last night?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember,\" Joey said with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember going to the club,\" you fought through the fog, \"and finding Wendy...\"  You trailed off as your memory faded.  \"...I don't remember much after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Joey said walking from the kitchen to the coffee table to retrieve his tablet, \"let me show you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turned on your stool and watched Joey as he walked to the coffee table.  As you twist on the stool you noticed your bottom half continued as it continued to face the counter.  You glanced down at the stool seat and saw first hand Tina's, now your perfectly round posterior.  Even in the oversized athletic shorts, there was no concealing the perfection of Tina's butt.  That reminded you of a puzzling question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey,\" you asked as you stood and walked over to the sofa, \"how did I end up in your gym clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked up from his tablet and smiled.  \"It's nothing I haven't seen before,\" he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at his comment as you sat down next to him on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said as he queued the photos.  The tablet displayed in vivid color images of Joey's wife, dressed in the shiny, black liquid catsuit, enhanced by the perfect make-up, cat ears and tail.  Even more haunting was what Tina was doing in the photos.  The images clearly showed Tina straddling a gorgeous woman dressed in a flirtatious genie costume.  You felt yourself becoming aroused as you took in the array of photos capturing Tina lustfully kissing and licking the genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you said after a deep swallow through Tina's tightening throat.  You unknowingly kept holding  your breath as you took in image after image of Tina looking impossibly titillating as she sensuously explored the genie with her tongue and lips.  As if Joey's log of photos wasn't enough, he closed the album and switched to a video app. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait until you see this,\" Joey said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe app queued immediately to a video obviously shot from Joey's smart phone inside the club.  The audio of the recording consisted of nothing but the rhythmic bass you recalled all too well pounding your eardrums. The video; however, recorded things you did not remember from the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you held your breath as you watched Tina gyrating and grinding on top of the genie, meanwhile the genie's hands groped Tina's ass and  breasts.  This scene played out for several minutes before cutting to another video. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly it was video still capturing Wendy and Tina's desperate affection for one another, although the video appeared to have been shot from inside Joey's Range Rover.<br>\r\nThe dim lighting inside the car was still enough to clearly capture Tina and Wendy as they continued their virtual love making in the back seat of the Rover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little shaky because I was shooting this while I was driving,\" Joey said.  \"In fact, watch this.  This is totally hysterical.  Watch, watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tina and Wendy ravaged each other in the back seat, the familiar red and blue strobes illuminated the Rover's interior from the rear windshield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video jiggled as Joey obviously placed his smart phone on the seat.  The recording held on the ceiling of the Rover; Joey was heard cursing in the audio recording as he rolled down his window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir,\" an unfamiliar, masculine voice could be heard off camera as the video continued to hold on the car's ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening officer,\" Joey's familiar voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is everything tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think things are going pretty well for me this evening,\" Joey said.  The camera caught the beam from a flashlight as the officer swept the interior of the Rover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the officer said with an obvious change in demeanor.  \"I guess things are going pretty well for you.  Do you know why I pulled you over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sir.\"  There was a long pause.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer laughed.  \"Well, uh...I, uh kind of forgot myself why I pulled you over.  Oh, yeah, you turned without signaling.  I'll need your license, registration and proof of insurance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera recorded sounds of Joey opening various compartments to comply. Several minutes later, the officer returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sir, have you been drinking this evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" Joey admitted.  My wife and I just left the club a few minutes ago and we're on our way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wife?  And that would be the..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cat,\" Joey said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the genie would be,\" the officer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife's new friend.  Sir, I can take any tests you need, of course.  I assure you I only had one drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Joey said narrating the video, \"right here he asks me to get out of my car and there's like five cop cars behind me.\"  As if on cue, the officer makes his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'm going to need you to step out of the vehicle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no protest from Joey as the camera recorded the interior light turn on signifying Joey stepping out of the Rover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the few minutes Joey was taking a field sobriety test, the camera recorded several different male voices as they gazed from the driver side window into the Rover's back seat  were a hauntingly seductive cat and beautiful genie where engrossed in their addiction of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" an officer exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" sighed another male officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the camera recorded the interior light again illuminating the interior as Joey got back into his Rover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That went well,\" Joey was recorded saying as he picked up his smart phone and stopped the recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video resumed.  This time it appeared to have been recorded from Joey and Tina's bedroom.  Unlike the video shot from inside the Range Rover, this video was steady and carefully angled as it recorded the genie and cat continuing their love making on the very bed which you have twice awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you.  You DO remember this.  You remember how amazing it was.  But why was it so amazing?  Then, almost as if reading your mind, the video answered your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video captured the provocative kitten reaching into something; a drawer perhaps.  Wherever she had reached, she returned with what looked like a massager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesus,\" you recalled aloud, \"I do remember this.  Wendy takes the massager from me and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by your command, the genie eagerly took possession of the wand and brought it to life with the power switch.  She moved the wand down between Tina's legs and held it firmly onto Tina's vagina over the catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with a dry mouth as the video clearly exhibited the genie bringing the sex kitten to a nirvana of orgasm after orgasm.  Your memory vividly returned as you recalled feeling Tina's body spasm in a frenzy with every explosive orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video finally relented.  The tablet automatically returned to the home screen of the video app itemizing Joey's various videos and movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in silence for almost a minute before suddenly realizing you hadn't taken a breath.  Tina's body corrected the oversight as you involuntarily gulped a deep breath of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  Wild right?\" Joey clicked off his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice but to admit it was, by far, the best homemade skin flick you had ever seen.  The alarming thing was that the video brought all of your once faded memories to a vivid recollection; and you remember it as nothing less than euphoric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Joey said glancing at his watch, \"Tina has an appointment for the spa in less than an hour.  Do want me to cancel it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" you replied. \"What did  she schedule to have done there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know, lots of things I guess.  She made the appointment in anticipation of the cruise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you said rubbing Tina's temples.  \"As long as I can maybe just lie down while they do... whatever they do.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll go get changed,\" you said as you stood from the couch and dragged Tina's tired body up the stairs to the bedroom where you searched for appropriate clothing for the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively rifled through Tina's underwear drawer.  Again you were amazed at the vast selection of delicate lace and satin panties.  You searched several minutes in hopes of finding at least one pair of panties that was not a thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEureka!  Your delicate fingers managed to find a pair of boy short panties.  The were lacy and looked extremely frilly, but at least they weren't a thong.  A quick search of an adjacent drawer produced a matching bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled with the bra as this was your first attempt to wear one.  The previous day you wore an athletic bra and a baby doll tee-shirt; neither of which required you to engage a clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of tries, you had successfully secured the bra and gently worked Tina's ample breasts comfortably into the cups.  Slipping the panties up Tina's legs and over her delectable butt, you paused and glanced at the full length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance soon tuned into an unbroken stare.  \"Jesus,\" you thought aloud as you gazed upon the reflection of Tina's shapely body clad in the delicate lingerie.  You conclude Tina looks even better than the lingerie catalogue models you so frequently lusted after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally tearing yourself from Tina's reflection, you venture into the vast fashion wilderness that is her walk-in closet.  You searched for the most simple thing you could find and located a black tee.  Seeing only dresses and skirts, you decided that eventually you would have to accept your current situation and wear something more feminine.  Your search ended after you located a knee length skirt cotton skirt.  The skirt's khaki color and numerous pockets reminded you of your cargo shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling the skirt up over the boy-short panties, you located a pair of leather sandals that looked to have a more reasonable heel.  The straps were tricky and you were not totally convinced you had secured them properly.  And why do the laces wrap around the ankles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally convinced you had laced the sandals as close to prefect as you could, you stood and walked to the mirror.  The sandals, while tricky, were much easier to walk in than the high-heeled boots from last night.  A quick check in the mirror and you were convinced your outfit looked like something Tina would wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter descending the stairs you stand in front of Joey who is still sitting on the couch watching his TV.  You follow his gaze to the large flat screen television hung high above the fireplace.  Somehow, Joey had managed to put the video he shot last night onto the large TV.  Joey shifts his gaze onto you and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look awesome,\" he said sincerely.  \"You decided to try one of Tina's skirts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you replied looking down past Tina's delectable breasts at her cargo skirt.  \"I figured I better get used to it and this skirt looked pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey continued to stare at you, but for some reason, it didn't bother you.  \"So, you want to drive me to this spa place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Sure.  Absolutely,\" Joey said rising from the couch.  He walked to the kitchen to retrieve his keys.  \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later you sat comfortably in the passenger seat of the Range Rover as Joey navigated to the spa.  Once again, you found the seatbelt cutting between Tina's breasts most annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Joey pulled into the circular driveway of what appeared to be an extremely expensive spa.  The building was a modern yet rustic structure comprised tastefully of cedar, stone and glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said aloud as you released Tina's breast from the constraints of the seatbelt and opened the passenger door.  \"Wish me luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it.  You'll probably enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" you replied sarcastically.  \"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though I'd hit the driving range.  My sticks are in the back.  So, I'll pick you up around...3:00,\" Joey said checking his Rolex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you sighed as you stepped out of the Range Rover and closed the passenger door.  Once again you felt like a child on his first day of school; or on her first day of school, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the stainless steel vertical bar on the tall, glass doors and pushed with more effort than you were accustomed to as a 200 pound man.  The reluctant door gave way and you entered the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobby, like the exterior, was a tasteful combination of rustic cedar beams and flat rock.  A large stone wall connected the the floor to the breathtakingly high ceiling.  Lighting illuminated the walls from the floor creating a studio effect.  Large leather couches and chairs surrounded several small tables in a meticulous arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn oversized glass desk sat angled to the right of the entrance. An expensive computer with no connecting wires stood lonely on the uncluttered surface of the desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn attractive brunette sat in the desk chair.  You estimated that she was well past forty, but her age hardly impeded her attractiveness.  She wore a black turtleneck that, although simple, looked expensive.  Her shapely hips and toned legs were encased in a below-the-knee, black leather skirt; like her turtle neck, it too, looked expensive.  You concluded you liked the look and would try mimicking it from Tina's vast wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's eyes were tastefully emphasized by various layers of make-up giving her a sophisticated look of sexual maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concluded the woman was the epitome of a M.I.L.F., and you would certainly have been up to the task, had you not been stuck in your current body.  You managed to find solace that, God forbid you and Joey could not find a way to switch you back to your body, Tina, like this receptionist, would likely be attractive for many, many years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.  Are you here for an appointment,\" the woman asked with little affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you replied with trepidation. Jesus, this is hard for me, you thought.  Couldn't this chick be a little nicer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My I have your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron...err, uh, I mean Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at you with judging eyes as she searched for the appointment on the computer's scheduler.  For a moment you felt that you could read her mind.  You felt her judgment wherein she concluded you were just a stupid tart expecting others to fall over themselves to make you happy just because you won the looks-lottery, but so dumb that you could hardly remember your own name.  No doubt the driver of the Range Rover that had dropped you off did not hook up with you for your brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus.  Are women really that judgmental?  Then again, maybe Tina's body is just making you feel insecure. Jesus, are all women this insecure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed almost disappointed when she found your appointment in her scheduler.  Her disapproving eyes looked up at you from the computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it looks like you are having...Wow,\" she said looking at the long list of services Tina had scheduled.  She read the list occasionally looking up at you for confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a hair trim, color and style with Adrian,\" she read aloud, \"facial with Tao, manicure and pedicure with Tao and Nicki, waxing with Tao and Nicki...Wow, you have a full day, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently,\" you sighed thinking you should have told Joey you wanted to blow off this spa nonsense and hang out at a sports bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist handed you a key.  \"Great, more keys,\" you mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just down the hall to your left,\" she said pointing past the rock wall.  You slowly moved down the hall and stopped at a door labeled \"lockers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered through the doorway and found yourself in a room similar in design as the reception area, although smaller.  Cedar lockers lined an entire wall adorned with large brass numbers.  You matched the locker number with your key and disengaged the lock.  Inside was a prepared set of towels, slippers and an oversized white, cotton robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming you're to undress and wear only the robe, you kept on the lacy bra and boy-shorts.  After securing your clothes in the same locker, you returned to the main reception area wearing the robe and slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you have a seat and I'll see who's ready for you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found your way to a large, leather sofa.  You spent several minutes enjoying the beautiful architecture of the wood beams and rock.  The huge windows framed a small pond surrounded by small, flowering trees.  The combination of the scenery, the comfortable couch and relaxing music came dangerously close to putting you to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the clicking of heels seconds before the receptionist stood in front of you holding a glass of champaign carefully wrapped in a paper napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're waiting,\" she said handing you the glass.  As you take the glass from her you notice her nails are thick and painted in a high-gloss black that seems to reflect every light in the spa.  You decided, for some reason, you liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said secretly admiring her nails.  You didn't understand how you found everything about this woman so becoming and wished so much to incorporate her look into your version of Tina, yet felt compelled to stay silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat completely relaxed for several minutes sipping the champaign.  You had always been a beer guy, but now in Tina's body, you found champaign more satisfying than your usual imported lager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina,\" the receptionist called you in a more pleasant demeanor, \"they're ready for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou traced the receptionist her finger pointing to someone standing at the entrance of a second hallway just to the right of the rock wall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the first time you were naked in front of someone other than Joey.  Your catsuit you wore out in public last night didn't count.  It was tight and left little to the imagination, but it certainly couldn't be counted as naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood alone in the cedar paneled room tastefully adorned with stark-white drapes and linens.  You apprehensively approached the massage table standing high in the center of the room.  You passed a full length mirror and froze.  Staring back at you was one of the most beautiful women you had ever seen, and she was naked.  The problem was, she was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke your admiring gaze and finished your short journey to the table. It was high for Tina's 5'6.\"  Using the stepping stool, you rested Tina's perfect posterior on the taught cotton sheet covering the pad on the massage table.  You used a second folded sheet at the far end of the table to cover your nakedness as you laid down on your back.  You rested peacefully listening to the quiet music, eyes closed.  The opposite door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Tina,\" a woman's voice cooed.  Opening just one of Tina's bright blue eyes, you see a slender Asian woman.  She wore a tight, black dress and black apron, both adorned with the spa's logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" you replied closing both eyes again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you said feeling more relaxed than you can ever remember in your previous body.  Her hands took either end of the sheet as she rolled it up over your new shapely legs and continued rolling well above your new vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively you bolted upright and gasped.  The Asian woman retracted and stared at you wondering what she had done wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay,\" she asked without a hint of any accent.  Realizing this must be routine in the world of females, you relaxed and laid back down on the padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine,\" you lied.  \"I just wasn't expecting...nothing.\"  You closed your eyes again.  You heard the woman opening containers and place various instruments on a tray next to her.  Then, she seemed to paint you.  It was warm, and comforting, until she put what seemed like paper on the paint and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST,\" you screamed as the woman ripped the skin from your leg.  You initiated the launch sequence to attack the woman and beat her senseless, then you saw her smile.  Realizing quickly this is just routine for many woman, and, you didn't want to seem like a total pussy; even you had one.  You apologized and laid back down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charade continued for what seem likes hours.  You half expected a North Korean interrogator to ask you questions. \"Alright, Alright!  I'll talk!  Just stop pulling off my skin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what did she say?  Whilst you were fully off on your North Korean tangent, you didn't hear what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Sure,\" you said, hoping she had offered you something to drink.  Alcohol preferably.  Only it was too late before you realized what she had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full bikini area, Ma'am?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hour later the woman was relieved by a second woman wearing the same uniform.  Unlike the Asian woman, her relief was larger, heavier and much older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had already switched positions and now found yourself as the Asian had left you, lying naked on Tina's silicone globes allowing her to efficiently remove any hair that had grown within the region of Tina's pussy to the small of her back.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" she said with a heavy German accent in a deep contralto.  She didn't wait for a reply.  \"I'm Olga. We'll start with your back then, ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's small hands made a few adjustments to the linens under your hairless body.  Olga folded a sheet and covered your perfectly shaped ass still glowing red from the wax treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga's iron hands worked deeply into Tina's tissue.  She worked quietly as she massaged your entire body from Tina's elegant shoulders to her adorable feet. The unbearable pain from an hour prior was only a distant memory.  You concluded unequivocally if there was a heaven, you had found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wunderbar,\" you quietly mumbled with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar too soon, Olga handed you a white, satin robe.  The smooth fabric slid easily over your hairless body.  You glanced down at Tina's delectable curves admiring the beauty of the smooth, hairless legs and vagina.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed Olga through a third doorway leading to another room; this one was largerer, adorned with oversized chairs resting on foot-high bases .  All of the chairs were empty, but for one.  Resting in the only occupied chair was a woman, likely older than Tina's 25, wearing the same robe.  Her face was covered in green mud.  Two cosmetologist simultaneously labored, beautifying the mystery woman; one highlighting the woman's hair, the other exercised the ritual of the pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga assisted you to the high, oversized seat.  \"I'll tell them you're ready.\"  She whisked away leaving you alone with the mystery woman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat in the silence of the background music; an acoustical number by a female artist.  Whatever is was, it was too girly, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least my tastes haven't changed; in music anyway,\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cosmetologists beautifying the mystery woman left the room, leaving the two of you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always enjoy my spa treatments, don't you,\" the woman said through her mud mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you replied dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sat up and looked at you through the mud mask.  You returned her gaze.  Her brown eyes didn't look at you, so much as through you.  The woman smiled.  You recognized this type of smile as not so much friendly, but more of a \"I know something you don't\" kind of smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been to the spa before then,\" the woman asked.  Suddenly your heart began pounding under Tina's generous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many times,\" you lied.  Was it a lie?  Whilst Aaron had never been to the spa, Tina had been countless times.  You hoped the lie placated your inquisitor.  The woman laughed.  Somehow she knew it was a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you lie to me...Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolted upright almost ready to jump to your feet to attack the mysterious woman or flee the spa in nothing but the pair of slippers and satin robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know who I am?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled again, but more warmly than the last.  \"Because, Aaron,\" the woman said laying back into her oversized chair, \"I am the one who switched the two of you.\"  The woman closed her eyes, as if she was back to doing nothing but enjoying her day at the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, YOU did this to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so egocentric, Aaron.  I did it to BOTH of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why,\" you pleaded.  \"And, who in the hell are you?!  And, why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, Aaron.  You wouldn't think this was just a chance meeting?  There are too many courses of events in play for anything to simply be left to chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina arranged this...?\"  You didn't know what to call it. Was this a meeting?  A set-up?  A shake-down?  A hostile take-over?  You had always considered yourself a very talented negotiator, talents which allowed you to accumulated substantial wealth, but you had always negotiated from a position of strength.  Now, you were at the mercy of Tina and this woman you didn't know, disguised in a mud mask.  Was that why she wanted to meet at the spa?  So she could disguise herself with a mud mask?  Even you had to admit it was a brilliant set-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leaned in closer to you, resting herself heavily on the arm of the chair.  She said nothing for a moment.  You finally had to break the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm someone you should never cross,\" she said with a serious stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this?\"  You glanced down at your curvaceous body wrapped in the satin robe.  \"Why? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple spell, young man.  But I would never cast such a spell lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For years people like me have been given different names by people like yourself.  'Witch' is an overly simplistic term.  I like to think of myself as someone giving balance to the universe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the hell is making me a chick giving balance to the universe,\" you interrupted. If she was annoyed by the interruption, she didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your case, it was about net gains.  You see, Tina cared deeply for a friend who was suffering, consequently causing Tina to suffer in kind.  By switching you with her, she and her dear friend were made whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She married her dearest friend, but as you,\" she said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked away taking a deep breath causing Tina's large breasts to rise and fall demonstratively.  \"Great,\" you said aloud, \"even if I get back to my body I'm married to a woman I don't even know.  That's just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and looked at the woman still leaning towards you from her chair.  \"How is it 'balance' if just Tina and her new wife are happy.  What about me and Joey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled and leaned back into the oversized chair and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Joey could be happier than you ever dreamed, Aaron.  IF you give it a chance,\" she said, her eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it chance!?!  I can't give THIS a chance!  I'm a guy for Christ's sake!\"  You looked down at your very unmanly body and back at the woman who seemed more intent on relaxing than answering your questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Tina first came to me she and her husband...Joey, you say his name is?  Anyway, they came into my store on the Cape...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're from Cape Cod?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sweetie.  Most of us are. Harwich to be exact.  Now, don't interrupt me again.  She and her husband came into my shop.  I remember seeing the most strikingly beautiful woman I'd ever seen. But she was sad.  I could see it.  When her husband was investigating a roll-top desk on the second floor, I asked her why such a gorgeous woman could be so sad.  She seemed to have everything a woman could ask for.  After she explained the situation, I new exactly what spell I could use to not only bring peace to the woman, but happiness to three additional people as well.  I just needed her and her husband, Joey, to read the same spell, so I conjured it on parchment inside the desk.  He found it almost immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spa associate entered the room and the mystery woman rose to her feet.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you pleaded as they both walked towards another door, \"what about Joey and me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and turned.  \"You two will be very happy, I'm sure,\" she said smiling.  \"You already helped him through a most troubling matter last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The catsuit?  How can you possibly know about that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" she said folding her arms, \"you and Joey go on that cruise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about that,\" you interrupted her a third time.  Again, she was forgiving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I see everything.  You don't think we just met here by chance do you?  You and Joey go on that cruise.  After you get home and you still want to go back to the old you, I'll see what I can do.  Fair enough?  Just give my vision of fate a chance.\" The woman turned and continued through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  How will I find you!?!\"  You shouted.  She ignored you and vanished into an adjoining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you thought aloud, \"Joey will never believe this.\"</span></div></div>",

Now you're comfortably retired at the ripe old age of 26 after selling said company. Hurting for money you are not. Your best friend Matt was your partner. You've been best friends since kindergarten. Ironically you have the same birthday. People have always joked calling you twins which doesn't seem far from the truth sometimes. You can finish each other sentences and never hide anything from each other. You know that he and his wife Amber have been having problems for awhile now, which is one of the reasons that motivated him to want to sell the company, that and the money. He thought it would give them more time to work through whatever the problem was. Unfortunately it had the opposite effect. Amber is a busty red head and has always been a bitch on wheels, but lately she has grown even more hostile and won't give a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another evening of relaxation for you when you door bell rings. You go to it and find Matt there nearly in tears. \"Dude, what's wrong?\" you ask while ushering him inside. Matt is shaking and barely makes it to the couch. You quickly pour him a glass of his favorite Scotch and sit down beside him. After a few sips he says, \"Amber and I just had another huge fight. She finally told me what the problem is\". He stops right there choking back tears. \"I'm here for you man, you can tell me\", you say throwing your hand on his shoulder. Matt slugs back the last of the Scotch in his glass and say, \"She's been seeing someone else\". \"Holy shit, she's been screwing some other guy. Matt, I'm so sorry\", you respond. Matt shakes his head and says, \"No, it's not another guy. She's leaving me for another woman. She says she likes girls and always has\". You sit there stunned and do the only thing you can think to do. You pour him another glass and then take a swig from the bottle for yourself. It's hard to believe that Amber is a dike. There is nothing butch about that girl. With her body she could be porn star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you finish off one bottle of Scotch and open another as he continues to sing the blues. \"She says she doesn't want anything not even a divorce, but she's leaving me. What does that even fucking mean, dude? I'm just glad I never had any kids with that lezbo bitch. You know she was always jealous of our friendship, man. Buddy, you know me better than anybody even my lezbo bitch wife. I love you man\", he says crying and then giving you a hug. You give him a quick hug back and say, \"I think you've had enough to drink. Let me help you to the guest room\". You get him into bed and take off his shoes. You then stumble to your own bed and pass out. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is one morning without you too much to ask?!\u201d he says rolling his back to you <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't feel like wasting time trying to explain things right now so you say, \"Matt, do you know where Aaron is at?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s strange asking where you're at, but if that was the strangest thing to happen today you would be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls back over and answers, \"Who cares, He woke me up an hour ago, told me to go to hell and just took off. But wait, why do you want to know where he is\"? He then rolls over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick him to the floor again and shout, \"Because I'm Aaron. Amber stole my body. So come on we need to find out where her and her lesbian witch girlfriend went\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what?\u201d He says staring at you in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes of telling him things only you would know he starts to believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo come on we have to go get my body back!\u201d you exclaim knowing that this explanation has wasted valuable time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hang on a second, I kind of like it this way.\u201d He says smiling. \u201cHa ha very funny, now let\u2019s go!\u201d you insist, \u201cCome on can u blame me, this way I can hang out with my best friend and still enjoy my wife\u2019s body.\u201d He says eyeing you up and down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, that isn't funny. Do you have any idea where they would go?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks for a moment and then says\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You fit in the tiny seats of the airplane a lot easier than your male body did. The two of you then pick up your luggage and plan your next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which hotel do you think they'll be at?\" you ask, \u201cWell since she spoiled and not use to having lots of money it is probably one of the most expensive ones,\u201d he says laughing since it was your money and not his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some discussion you narrow it down to three. So you pick one and catch a cab. You leave getting a room to Matt as you head over to get a drink at the hotel bar, after the day you've had you need it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt joins you just after you start on your second drink. \"I got us the Honeymoon suite\", he says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep dreaming Man, it\u2019s not going to happen\", you reply knowing exactly what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it was all they had and if Amber shows up at this hotel chances are they'll get one of the honeymoon suites to\", he answers. You can't argue with Matt's logic, he\u2019s smart, that's why he was your business partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt orders a drink as you finish off your second. \"You better go easy on those. Amber never could handle her alcohol\", Matt states laughing thinking about what a cheap drunk she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not Amber\", you say back already slurring your words. \"Ah well technically\u2026\" he says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the mirror behind the bar and realize he's right. And with that you raise your hand to signal the bartender, \u201cOne more of these and a shot, I don\u2019t care what kind.\u201d You say with a drunken smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour you get the urge to use the bathroom and get up to go, when you try you almost fall over. Matt catches you before you hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to warn you\", he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt helps you out of the bar and onto the elevator up to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Matt, giggle, and say, \"I'm so fucking drunk. This is great I usually have to drink five times as much to feel this good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do feel good; all warm and fuzzy. Your whole body is tingling. Your nipples are as hard as diamonds. Matt helps you into the room and to the only bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Buddy, I don't know what I would do without you. I mean this whole thing has got me stressed out\", you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this always helped Amber relax.\" Matt says getting behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts rubbing your shoulders and neck. And it really did help; I mean you can say what you want about their marriage but he really did know how to take care of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then unzips your dress, letting it fall to your waist revealing your ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then naturally arch your back in shock as though a chill just ran down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait What the Hell!\u201d you exclaim but then he starts rubbing your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, that feels so good\", you moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, just relax,\u201d Matt says as his hands start to wander to your breasts and your already erect nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels really good, you start feeling a wetness form between your legs. You're really getting turned on; you couldn\u2019t help it, apparently this was the effect alcohol and a message had on Amber\u2019s body<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You spread your legs for a better view and the lips of your vagina part. It all looks so alien and wrong. \u201cThis cannot really be happening\u201d, you mumble. You jump off the toilet and walk to the mirror. The person looking back at you is not a stranger, but it\u2019s also not you. Its Amber your best friend\u2019s hot but bitchy wife. You look down at your boobs again. Matt got these for her when they were still dating. Amber though picked the size and though you never thought so before you now think she went to large. You cup them with your hands. Honestly it\u2019s something you\u2019ve wanted to do since she got them. \u201cNot bad baby. You like that, do you want me suck on those bad boys\u201d, you say to yourself in the mirror? You give both of your nipples a pinch. You\u2019re shocked by how sensitive they are.

Just consider that this may have been fate that his wife left him and you're here with him. As for being gay, some are cut out for it and others aren't. I can tell you're not gay. You enjoyed being with him last night. I can tell by the way your body felt when you were talking about it. That should tell you something right there. Don't let this oportunity slip past without giving it a try. If it doesn't work just remember what they say. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't say a word as Don finishes your massage. You just lay there and think about what he said. You haven't had one realationship that has worked your whole life. You've pretty much given up on it the last couple of years. The only one that has always been there for you is Matt. \"Could this have been fate\", you wonder?</span></div></div>",

All you can here are Amber's words playing in your head, saying that she wanted to make things right. <i>She wants to switch back! No more making Matt his lunch, no more sleeping together, no more bras!</i> You quickly lower your mini skirt so you can squat down and pee. <i>This is the last time I'll have to sit to pee!</i> Despite your jubilation, you have to admit that being Matt's wife isn't horrible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back over the past three months you have spent as his wife. After you returned home from Vegas, you and he tried to resume a normal life. You, reluctantly, took up the role of a loyal housewife, shopping, doing the dishes and laundry, and making his meals. In return, Matt had provided you with a safe and secure home and protected you from unwanted attention while in public. He really was a good husband. He did push for sex after a few weeks, which you tried to resist.But when he started groping your boobs and your knees got weak, your resolve melted. It had been a viscous cycle. He would screw you, in every way imaginable, you would enjoy it, and then scream at him when it was over. But within a few days you'd be back at it. Thank goodness you were using condoms at least. But the sex was phenomenal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What in the world?? Why am I thinking about this? I am about tho change back!</i> You quickly wipe your vagina and pull your skirt back up. After washing your hands, you rush back into the living room with Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to talk about?\" you say. \"Well, I know how hard this must be for you. Being a woman and being a man's wife is an adjustment. Especially a woman as sexy as you,\" Amber says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe at being called sexy, and take a sip of your drink to calm your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, I felt bad. I am not gonna say I haven't enjoyed your body. It is great, sex is great. But you deserve to enjoy sex too. So, I'm here to make things right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, you take another sip of your drink but begin to feel a slight buzz around your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I spiked your drink with XX-1!\" she declares with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you what??\" \"I spiked your drink, with an extra potent drug. It drastically increases the female sex drive! You and Matt will be banging like bunnies in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally you scream in horror. \"WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT??? WE ALREADY HAVE SEX!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Amber explodes with laughter. \"You two actually do it? That is hilarious! I can just imagine him banging you, your big wobbly tits bouncing all over the place. Wow, so this drug should make it much more fun! Well, I have to go now, my girlfriend is waiting for me. See ya around, sweet-tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs out the door as you sit on the ground, stunned. You could chase her, but what would be the point? She is faster than you, stronger than you, plus it is impossible to run with your big boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the ground, moping for an hour. Suddenly, you hear the doorbell ring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Matt's cock is still pressed against your bubble butt and his arm is draped over your body and resting on your tit. You carefully remove his hand from your large breast and roll out of bed. You stumble into the bathroom and start up the shower. You take a moment to look at yourself in the mirror and observe your body. At 5'2 and a petite 110 pounds, you looked small. Your 36DD breasts seemed ever larger on such a small body and your butt was perfectly rounded. Your reddish brown hair hung past your shoulders. You had wanted to cut it, but Matt said it would make people suspicious and draw unwanted attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your observation and stepped into the shower. The water ran down your body, flowing over your curves. You soaped over your boobs and washed your long, luscious hair. You could hear Matt stirring and knew he would be in the shower soon, so you quickly cut off the shower and grabbed your towel. You wrapped the towel over your impressive bust after drying off. You walked over to your counter and plugged in your blow dryer and started work on your mass of hair. Sadly, this feminine hygiene routine had become natural for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt walked into the room. \"Morning babe.

While it does feel weird to be wearing a bikini and visiting a beach on a romantic vacation with your <i>husband</i><i></i>, you cannot help but be happy and peaceful. Matt's words echo in your mind, <i>I'm so glad you are my wife, you were meant to be a girl, you are better this way, you are such a sexy and beautiful woman.</i> You may not like it, but part of you wonders if it is true. You'd always been happy as a man, but you'd never really done anything. Was being a woman and the devoted wife of a strong and loving and hot man really what your destiny was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you pondered these thoughts, you and Matt arrived on the beach. He had one hand on your butt protectively and had been casually groping you the entire time. Sadly, you were used to it. \"So, do you wanna tan for a while or go swimming?\" Matt asked. \"I guess we can lay out for a bit,\" You responded. You and Matt got a towel and umbrella and laid down. Matt got out the suntan and begin rubbing it on your shapely legs, moving up to your curvaceous butt. His fingers kneaded the soft flesh of your booty and you let out an involuntary sigh of contentment. Matt continued to grope you lovingly, while you relaxed, His hand occasionally drifted to your pussy and you definitely felt aroused, but you tried to ignore it. Within minutes, you fell into a peaceful sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, Matt was asleep as well. He looked so handsome and hot sleeping on the cool sand. The waves peacefully crashed onto the beach. <i>Here I am...enjoying a romantic day with my husband. Who would've thought...</i> Matt slowly stirred and looked over at you with a happy grin. \"Hey baby. How was your nap?\" \"It was pretty good, thanks...Do you wanna take a walk?\" Matt agreed and the two of you set off down the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked, Matt held your hand. For the entire world you looked like a happy romantic couple. Maybe that's because you were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you came upon some sort of rock structure, you stopped to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/236x/80/cb/d5/80cbd5c084b6f6ea513bd9052a8d9011--sexy-bikini-bikini-babes.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/236x/80/cb/d5/80cbd...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, there is something we have to talk about.\" You started. He looked at you expectantly. \"We've been together for months now, as husband and wife. We've known each other forever. But still...It's different. I'm not sure I'll ever get used to being a girl, or your wife. I'm a man and I wish I still was one...But yet, I can't deny how I feel about you...about my husband. I am madly attracted to you, and I never thought I'd say that to a man. I think I'm losing my sense of who I was. I've given a lot of thought to this recently...\"</span></div></div>",

Could he have somehow hypnotized you to believing you had switched bodies? It certainly makes more sense than a magical body swap. Then again you, Aaron, well Amber in your body took off with her girlfriend, or did he. If you\u2019re really Amber and Matt did hypnotize you into believing you were Aaron trapped in Amber\u2019s body this whole thing could be a set up. Why did he pick the Honeymoon suite? You again stare at yourself in the mirror and test your memory. You don\u2019t have any memories of being Amber. You\u2019ve always been Aaron, at least you\u2019re pretty sure you are. You shake your head trying to get these thoughts out of your head. \u201cI\u2019m Aaron\u201d, you repeat over and over in your mind.<br>\r\n  You walk back out to find Matt still asleep on his back on top of the sheets. His cock which you rode last night is erect sticking up towards the ceiling. You feel a strange stirring between your legs. Your heart beats faster and your nipples go hard. You enjoyed having that inside you last night. That\u2019s not a very manly thought. Could that mean that you really are Amber? Without really thinking about it you walk over and stroke his cock. It quivers in your hand. You then touch yourself. \u201cI could test this. If I enjoy it sober maybe that means I really am Amber\u201d, you think to yourself.

You crawl onto the bed, your legs spreading wider and wider as you prepare to take your prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matt begins to snore, breaking your trance. You then look up at him, noticing the stupid look on his face. Then a memory of the morning after Matt\u2019s bachelor party comes to mind. Unfortunately you remembered it clearly, he was in nearly the same condition and all the other groomsman had already cleared out, only pausing to wake you up to get him ready. The placed was trashed and when you thought things couldn\u2019t get worse you distinctly remember an angry bridezilla phone call telling you to do your job and get him to the altar. And with that memory you knew that there was a distinct difference between you and Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, this confirmation came to you while you were half naked, soaking wet, and straddling Matt. Luckily you hadn\u2019t tested your theory yet. You quickly jump off the bed, which managed to wake Matt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls over to see you standing there half naked, \u201cMorning baby, mind helping me with this?\u201d he says gesturing to his morning wood.

Joey was in the shower so you have time to get dressed, unfortunately Amber\u2019s clothes did not make it easy.

What if, not having been born to this body, and experiencing puberty, and learning to control things, you are responding in a natural way? Well, for a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost doesn't matter now. In the time that you were staring at Matt's cock, your breathing became more shallow. You realized that you enjoyed the feel of him inside of you last night. Hell! If you were stuck in Amber's body for now, why not enjoy it while you are there? Technically, you really were Matt's wife at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew what you were doing, you were making love to Matt. He woke up, but he certainly didn't argue. You were amazed at the level of pleasure that you felt in Amber's body! You never experienced anything like this as a male! Two things became clear to you as you made love to Matt. One was that it was not hypnosis. Nothing in your imagination could have caused you to feel what you were feeling. This was real! The second was that, you couldn't help enjoying this. You did feel some guilt from your male mind, but somehow, that only made what you were doing seem kinky, which turned you on more! You had an orgasm when he did. It was great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done, Matt stroked your head. \"Not only did I not expect that, I thought you would be mad at me for last night when we were drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"I was at first, but this body seemed to have other ideas. So I figured, why fight it?\" Then you quickly added, \"We are still going to get me back in my own body! That hasn't changed!\" You giggled, \"It is just that, as long as I am here, I might as well enjoy myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt leaned over and kissed you gently, \"You won't get any arguments from me. That is the first time I made love to my wife in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two of you showered together, and of course, you no longer felt odd dressing in front of Matt. Somehow, you knew how to dress, and even do your makeup. The only thing that was awkward was wearing high heels, which seemed to dominate Amber's wardrobe. Though, the longer you walked in them, the more naturally you seemed to walk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Breakfast with Matt felt almost normal. As usual, the two of you made each other laugh. If it wasn't for the feminine laugh that came out of your mouth, or occasionally catching Matt staring at your breasts, you might have even said you enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exploring the casino that you were in as thoroughly as you could, with no sign of Amber in your body, the two of you walked to the next casino that Matt thought would be likely. It was hard to ignore the stares from the men that you passed, and the many leering looks at your body, especially your breasts. It only served to confirm that this was no illusion. And that knowledge made you feel very insecure, knowing very well what those men were thinking. That made you cling tighter to Matt's arm as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours, you sighed, \"Could we stop and play a little while? These heels are killing my feet! I need to sit down for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at you, \"Sure baby. I think I could you a break too.\" It was not until a long time later that you realized that he called you 'baby', and that you didn't consider it odd.At the table, you accepted a drink, even though it was still a bit early. You needed something to help you relax a little, but you were careful to keep it at one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, at the tables, and later at lunch, you had a great time with Matt! If it wasn't for the breasts that kept reminding you of how different you both were, you could have said it was like old times. How could Amber not see how great a guy Matt is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you explored most of five casino's during the day, with occasional stops to rest your feet. At the end of the day, Matt said, \"Well, we can keep looking, but at this point, she would always want to take in show. I checked things out, and I have no doubt which one would be her pick. Would you like to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he told you what show, you said, \"Really? Yuk! But I guess we don't have a choice if we hope to find my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show was as bad as you dreaded, and both of you were bored silly, and there was no sign of Amber. When it was done, you groaned and said to Matt, \"Seriously? That would have been Ambers's first choice? I mean, that show sucked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed, \"I know! Right? But yeah, she would have loved it. Should we go for number two on the list?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, \"I don't think I could sit through another one like that. At least, not sober. Why don't we find a show we would like?\" Of course, Matt had no trouble with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to that show, and the two of you laughed the whole time! In this female body, you almost peed yourself more than once! All the same, you were getting tired, and by the end of the show, you found that you had unconsciously snuggled up to Matt. When you did realize it, and how good it felt, you looked up at Matt. There was something about the eye contact that Matt took as a signal, and he bent over and began to kiss you. That was not what you really intended, but it did feel good, and soon you were kissing him back! Then that tingle started to happen between your legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke the kiss and whispered to Matt, \"I think we should finish this in our room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in your room, you gladly welcomed Matt's kisses, and his touches on your breasts. You had no objections when you felt him begin to pull the zipper on the back of your dress. You weren't even sure at what point you began to massage his crotch, but soon enough, you had undressed each other, and before you knew it, you were on the bed with your legs spread wide. You loved the feeling of Matt's cock penetrating your pussy, and how it felt inside of you!  Again, making love to Matt was fantastic! When you were both done, you fell asleep in his arms.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re still half asleep but aware enough to know someone is sucking your tits and fingering your already wet pussy. You let out a moan and the finger is removed. You then feel something much larger slide inside of you. It begins a rhythmic thrusting inside of you. Your breasts are fondled and your nipples tugged. You spread your legs wider to allow it further inside of you and to allow your clit to grind against him. \u201cOhhh\u201d, you moan as you climax. As you orgasm you wake up the rest of the way and see Matt above you. His face contorts and you feel his cock explode inside of you. \u201cOh fuck\u201d, you scream shoving him off. His cock pulls out spraying cum all over your stomach and breasts. You leap out of the bed and shout, \u201cYou Jackass!\u201d You stumble towards the bathroom with Matt right behind you. \u201cBaby, what\u2019s the matter\u201d, he asks? You turn at the bathroom door and say, \u201cDon\u2019t baby me asshole. I\u2019m not Amber, I\u2019m Aaron, your best friend it seems you forgot that last night and this morning when you decided to fuck me\u201d. Matt holds up his hands and says, \u201cHey, wait a minute. You were one last might that was all feel my breasts and tearing off my pants yelling fuck me\u201d. Your whole body shakes as you remember that and know it\u2019s true. \u201cI was drunk and you took advantage of me\u201d, you scream back shutting the door in his face.<br>\r\n You then run to the shower and jump in. You don\u2019t even wait for the water to get hot first. You try to wash off the dirty feeling, but it doesn\u2019t work. You screwed Matt last night and even worse you enjoyed it. At least the body you currently have enjoyed it. You were drunk, but not drunk enough that you couldn\u2019t have stopped it if you\u2019d wanted to. You step out of the shower and throw on a top. You stand there looking at yourself in the mirror for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://braexplosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/busty-amateur-beauty-in-a-plunging-neckline-tshirt.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://braexplosion.com/wp-content/uploa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start feeling bad about how you treated Matt. For all intents and purposes you are his wife Amber. He\u2019s got to be confused about what has happened as well. This bitch left him for another woman. You know you should apologize to him, but wonder how he\u2019ll that. Will he figure it was ok what happened last night and try it again? Amber would never apologize for treating him like shit so he'd probably be ok, but then you're not Amber.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's just that I'm having trouble with all this and... and...\" You have to stop or feel like you will break down and cry.  You reach up and feel your wet eyes and sniff a bit.  You try to continue but Matt gets up and moves toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I understand.  I'm a bit confused too.\"  He gives you a hug that you don't think to resist.  Somehow this simple act makes you feel better and you let him hold you for a bit while you try to regain your composure.  Suddenly you're very aware that he's still naked and that he's getting aroused.  You pull back a bit and look up at him a little irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're getting horny again? After all of this you still can't see how wrong all of this is.  I mean just the other night we were getting drunk together and bitching about women!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt doesn't let go.  \"I know, but you have to admit that when you are a guy... I mean in your other body, that you didn't think about Amber and getting in her pants.\"  He grins at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment before responding.  \"You know, when I first met her I noticed how hot she was but then I began to realize what a bitch she is and the hotness seemed to go away.  Anyway, I'm sorry that I started to act like her.  I just have all these emotions that all want to get out.\" You manage to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber always was emotional, but she was mean about it.  Not like you.  You have all the same hormones running through your body but you still manage to be my best friend.\"  You can see he's fighting not to be emotional as well.  Then before you realize it, Matt is kissing you.  Not the horny kiss from last night but a sweet, passionate kiss that you begin to return.  Your heart flutters and you feel a shudder move through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you snap out of it.  \"What are you thinking?\" As you pull away.  \"We need to go find Amber and switch this!\"  You move to the other side of the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we don't\" Matt replies with a sad look on his face. \"Listen, you and me... well, we've always been best friends and I would have loved you but I'm not into men.  Believe me, Amber would accuse me of it when she thought you and I were hanging out too much.  But I felt no attraction to you that way.  But now... now I find you incredibly attractive.  You're right about how Amber's bitchiness always made her less attractive but you're different.  Last night and this morning was better than any time Amber and I had sex.  I... I want us to stay this way... please.  We'll make it work and I think we'll be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're moved by his brutal honesty.  You know what he meant by saying he wasn't attracted to another man.  You are the same way.  Then you blush because you have to admit that now you are.  You pulled away from his kiss because it felt nice and you liked it.  Shaking your head, you try to make sense of it and make your decision<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're awake and as you come to, you realize that it's coming from the centre of the room. Turning over in bed is more difficult than normal. Your head is fuzzy and your body is heavy. You're eyes come into focus and what you see makes you think you're still dreaming. A blonde girl stands in the middle of the room. She's gorgeous, her flowing lock's falling down to her shoulders and her blue eyes are set off by a skimpy blue strapless dress stretched across her double-D breasts. Her perfect calves look great in six inch strappy sandals with open toes. \"Has Matt got a call girl in?\" is you're first thought. That is until you see who's sitting next to her. Matt is tied to chair completely naked. His ankles are bound to the chair legs and his wrists are bound to the arms with his fists balled tight. You realize his mouth is gagged and he stares at you with wide disbelieving eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl stops chanting when she sees you've woken up and her face splits into a huge grin. \"Good morning darling?\" she greets you with a sing song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's goin-....\" you start to ask but grab your mouth in shock as a high pitched female voice as replaced your own. Looking at your hands you notice the long French manicured finger nails on now slim digits. Two of which sport a wedding band and an engagement ring. You sit up and shock and feel you're chest wobble like two bowls of jello. Looking down, a motion that frames your vision with long red hair, you stare in disbelief at the huge creamy breasts with large brown nipples heaving as you hyper ventilate. Past the tits is a shaved wet pussy and just over your right hip is a tattoo written in italic writing. It says \"Amber\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you having a nightmare? Poor dear!\" The blonde girl says laughing as you stagger to your now small feet and shuffle on long sexy legs to the dress mirror in the corner of the room. You're eyes are as wide as Matt\u2019s and are now a bright shade of green. A small up turned nose splashed with freckles over full pink lips, the bottom of which is quivering as you're new mouth tries to frame an appropriate question whilst hyperventilating. It is a face you have grown to hate over recent years. But now it is yours. You are Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/9/1/919bb-ths01022009_15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.t-nation.com/forum_images/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything and even more shocking sight walks into the reflection of the mirror. It's a man with a grin on his face carrying a gun and wearing jeans and a black t-shirt. He walks up to the blonde girl and kisses her on the cheek as they both laugh at you're expression in the mirror. It's you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wouldn't be the first time your company's money paid for a boob job\" He pinches one of your huge nipples \"but I don't suppose double F would look right on this body.\" You let out a high pitched squeak and rub the hurt boob. Amber towers over you. For a minute you think he must have grown somehow, but then you realize that you have in fact shrunk. You have rarely seen amber without the slutty high heeled platform shoes she wares to increase her natural height of just 5 foot 2 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell have you done to me?\" You're voice is now high pitched and nasally. You have always hated Amber's voice and described it as whiney.

I love Amber but as lovely as you're new body is, and it is lovely sweetie, I like to be fucked from time to time. By a man, I also like money and spending it. So we got to thinking that if we could get miserable old Matt to sell that stupid company of yours and take the profits we could get Amber a lovely dick and lots of cash with my magic and a simple spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plan was working great until dip-shit over there fucked it up.\" Amber continued pointing his gun at Matt \"See your best bud hasn't told you the whole story as to why he has hit the bottle over the last few months. I'm sure he has peddled you the sob story about how his marriage is on the rocks, I'm sleeping around, blah blah blah.\" He said sarcastically. \"Well that\u2019s only partly true. As well as buying me the heaving birthday presents that are bursting off your chest. Hot shot decided to play at Rain Man down the Casino and just when I go to steal his worthless body I find that not only is he stone cold broke but he is 500 grand in the hole with some local low life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Matt. Surely he couldn't be that stupid but then again there are now more pressing problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going let the gangster kill the stupid fuck and run with his life insurance. But then my darling Karen here had a better idea. Let\u2019s steal your body and take your money instead.\" Karen beamed with renewed pride. \"At first I was against it because I hate your guts but then I came round. After all you have a great body and an even greater bank account. But now we reach a problem that Karen and I still disputing. I want to shoot Matt and then you and make it look like the fucker killed his wife after finding out about her affairs and then turned it on himself to save himself from the prison and/or gangsters that are after his kneecaps\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" You start, but Amber cuts you off. \"But Karen thinks we should just leave you two to it. After all you spend enough time with each other you might as well be married and the gangsters are likely to catch up with Matt eventually. Why bloody my hands? But I'm just a little worried that you will end up a loose end and maybe, just maybe, you could convince someone who you really are.\" Amber taps the gun against her new hip as she deliberates. \u201cI tell you what I will do. I let you decide. Do you want to live as the bimbo slut wife of your best friend or would you rather die now to save yourself the shame?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard looking down at you're new female body. Could you live like this? As a woman, A woman that you have always hated. But then again there is no way you're ready to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Amber and with your voice cracking in your throat you choke out the words \"I want to live\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and Karen grin at each other. \"Good\" Amber says. \"Then you will do exactly what I tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amber Britney Jennings\" you say through gritted teeth as anger rises in your throat. Karen laughs at the look on your face. Even she towers over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello Amber,\" The new Aaron says with a wave. \"And who's that guys in the chair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Matt Jennings,\" You say with a hint of resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he is\u2026\" Aaron asks waving his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My....husband\" you manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow if he is your husband then what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....am....his....wife\" You choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren and Aaron laugh at you as you stand naked with huge breasts heaving in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a pretty wife you are. Tell me Amber how do you like you're new assets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hate them. There monstrous. I look like a slut. These are the answers that spring to mind but you know she will take pleasure from them. You settle for \"There...big\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_mall/igaya-web/cabinet/item7/img55994209.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://thumbnail.image.rakuten.co.jp/@0_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure are Amber. You have lover boy to thank for that. He wasn't happy with my natural double DD and wanted me to get them increased to E cup. I never wanted that and always told him where to go. Imagine his surprise when I asked for those double FF monsters for my birthday. Of course he didn't realize that I was planning on him to sport them for the rest of his life. I'm kind of disappointed he doesn't but it does make me happy that instead you will spend the rest of your life with people staring at those tits, judging you, whilst you're best friend gets a hard on every time he looks at you. After all you don't have the money to get rid of them and who's going to employ a huge breasted slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one,\" You sob as a tear rolls down your new face. Matt is looking away, his face red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren looks on with mock concern and wipes a tear from you're cheek.\"Oh come now baby there's lots of jobs out there for you; Stripper, Porn star, Glamour model, Hooker\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\" You say and take a swipe at her but Aaron gestures at you with his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now. You want me to shoot Matt?\" You just shake your head, too angry to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darling look she really loves him!\" Karen cooed sarcastically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure baby. I think the slut just wants to save her own skin. Maybe we should just kill them?\" Aaron asked only half joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let\u2019s test her then Honey?\" Karen said in that annoying sing song voice. \"What do you have in mind Sweetie\" asked Aaron<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren turned to you, the grin disappearing from her face \"Get on your hands and knees and crawl like the slut your are to your loving husband and suck his dick like the good wife you tell us you are, do it or we'll shoot you in the stomach and while you writhe in pain make you watch us execute your best friend\". She says in a stern voice Aaron grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to refuse but think better of it as Aaron cocks the gun. Instead you sink miserably to your knees and begin to crawl towards the gagged Matt who looks at you with a mixture of horror and shame. The thick pile of the carpet is crushed beneath your knees and fingers as you slowly crawl with the enormous tits swinging under you, occasionally brushing your arms heightening you're shame. When you reach Matt you kneel and brush you're long red locks out of your face. Your monstrous tits prevent you from getting near to his crotch so you lift them on to his knees and lean into his lap, feeling the tits get squashed below you. You can't bring yourself to look at Matt\u2019s face. Instead you gently take his half erect member in his hands and start to massage it until it gets hard. It doesn't take long. You steel yourself and wrap your plump pink lips around his shaft and suck. Trying to ignore the taste and feeling you bob up and down on the throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now guys.\" Karen called from behind, her sickly sweet voice returning. \"If you love each other you should be staring Longley into each other\u2019s eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and stare into Matt's straining red face. He is trying to say something through the gag. You guess he is trying to say sorry. This is the most humiliating thing you've ever done and you begin to feel his dick start to twitch as he tries desperately to stop himself from blowing his load. His delay just extends your humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Amber, make sure you swallow your husband\u2019s present. Every drop and when you're finished thank him for a lovely gift.\" Karen continues in a breathy voice like she is struggling for control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give one final suck and wince as Matt spasms and his first hits the back of your throat. You clamp you lips shut and swallow the disgusting cum as it\u2019s pumped into your new mouth. When you're finished you sit up with an aching jaw and look up at Matt, \"Thank you for your gift\" you squeak in that horrible nasally voice and turn for more instruction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aaron just stares with a strange look on his face. \"Oh babe will you do that for me later?\" he asks Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wait until later?\" Karen asks sweetly. \"She used to call you a slut. Just think how much you will enjoy her sucking your dick? Amber dear, crawl over here and blow my new boyfriend like a good cocksucker.\" She takes the gun from Aaron as you hesitate. \"Do it or i will shoot you in the knee caps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin another journey on your hands and knees across the carpet and kneel before you're old body who has made no move to get his dick out so you reach for his zipper. \"No hands Amber honey. Use your mouth please\". Grimacing in shame and rage you feel for the zipper with your lips and pull it down with your teeth. Using your tongue you manage to hook the dick that was once yours and pull it free. The huge penis hits you in the eye as it falls out, streaking your cheek with pre cum. You look up and take your second dick of the morning into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time Amber I don't want you to swallow it. You don't deserve my boyfriend\u2019s sweet gift\". It doesn't take long before Aaron's new dick starts to switch as he is obviously not used to this equipment. You quickly back off glad of this small reprieve. That is until you realize what that means. You squeal as the first wad hits you square in the face. Aaron gasps as he continues to coat your face and hair with the sticky mess, the last few shots splattering across you're huge tits. The cum mixes with the tears that begin to flow down your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren is near orgasms herself and has sat down on the bed breathing hard. Aaron gets a hold of himself and puts his new dick away. \"Wow that was amazing. But enough fun, we have a plan to catch later today. You're hard earned millions won't spend themselves. You and matt can go but if I ever see or hear from you or arsewipe again then you\u2019re dead. Got it?\" You nod causing more cum to drip from your chin onto your heaving breasts. He takes the gun, walks behind Matt and pistol whips him to knock him out. \"Right that takes care of lover boy for the moment. You watch her while I get him dressed and call them a cab. Clean her up and get her dressed\" He says and tosses Karen the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing babe, but can I have a tinsy bit more fun with her first?\" she asks. \"Of course\" Aaron grins and drags the unconscious Matt out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Amber dear we're a bit of a mess aren't we? Has that cum gone all cold and icky?\" she asks with a mock frown. You just nod in response. Then clean yourself up, slightly relieved you begin to make your way to the sink, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Karen asks, \u201cTo wash myself off\u2026\u201d you say with your new nasally voice but she cuts you off, \u201cI didn\u2019t say you could do that, use your tounge. She says as she starts to finger herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meekly obey, collecting the cum with your finger tips and long nails and slowly licking each one clean. Wincing at the disgusting taste, when you\u2019re done with your face and long hair you lift up each tit and lick them clean.\u201d Karen gasps and orgasms as you drop the monster tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s it nice and clean\" she says breathing hard. Actually you feel anything but clean, cum has dried in your hair and across your skin. Karen walks over to a pile of clothes and tosses them to you. \"Get dressed honey\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you look at the clothes. There's no bra or underwear but you pull on a luminous green spandex top with a very low halter neck to show off the massive cleavage. The skirt is a shiny latex black latex micro skirt that just stretches across you're now full butt. Karen passes you a pair of ridiculous shoes. Their slutty even by Amber's standards. You stagger as you slip on the open toped sandals with two inch cork platform sole and a chunky cork 5 inch heel. The straps are luminous green plastic with cheap looking green bows on the toe straps. You teeter over to the mirror using tiny steps, with the latex squeaking against your butt and look at yourself in shock. \"I look like a whoooorrrre\" you moan nasally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do Honey. You see me and Amber have been having a competition. Every week for the last year we have been seeing who can by the most hooker like outfit so that we could dress Matt up when we stole his body. I guess that won't be happening, but not to worry. You can see all the results yourself when you get home. We thrown away all of Ambers old boring clothes and left our hooker-clothes for you to enjoy at your new home. Of course you could replace them, if you had any money. Now let me take a look.\" Karen walks over and grabs an ear and with a pinch inserts in a huge plastic luminous green hoop earring into your now pierced lobe. Putting in the other one she stands back and admires her work as you wobble on you ridiculous shoes. \"There, now just one more thing.\" She hands you a cheap looking luminous green plastic purse. \"Everything you need is in there.\" You open it up and stare at your new life. Keys, Lipstick, Tampons, Condoms, There is even a pack of menthol cigarettes and a lighter. Unlike you, Amber is a smoker and the cravings you get from one look at the white filters peeking out from the half flipped lid tells you that you are now as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and Aaron walk in holding a groggy looking and now dressed Matt. He grins at your outfit. \"I can't believe I came here dressed like that. Now come on and don't try anything.\" As if you could, you can barely walk in the platform shoes and you are forced to take small mincing steps down the stairs towards the front door as Karen and Aaron laugh from behind. \"The bank has taken Matt's apartment so I've rented you a lovely place down town. It\u2019s a bit of a rough neighborhood but still more than you and your husband can afford. Hopefully it will be a while before the gangsters catch up with you. The cabs paid for. I told him to take my drunken buddy and his hooker home so please keep up the pre-tense. The driver knows the way. Enjoy your life together guys. It\u2019s going to be a little harder but if you get down just think of us spending your money.\" Aaron laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf carrying Matt you stumble towards the cab with its driver leering at you tits. You get in and turn to look at you home for one last time. Karen playfully waves as Aaron kisses her in the door way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to start a new life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s about 10am when the cab pulls up in a rough part of town outside a ramshackle apartment block. Matt is still pretty out of it, but you're not sure if it\u2019s from the bourbon he was drinking last night or the blow to the back of the head, it\u2019s probably both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go lady\". The cab driver says, talking directly at your tits in the rear view mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me get him inside?\" He is now far too heavy to carry in your now petit frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I get paid to drive? Anything else is extra. I'm sure you can understand that in your business.\" he says angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it.\" you yell at the cab driver as you half drag half carry Matt out of the car. Carrying him into the building is no easy task in the platform heels but eventually you get him outside room 212, the number on the keys in your new purse. As you struggle to contend with the keys and your long nails a man shouts down from the hall, \"Hey Amber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump in surprise and turn to see a fat hairy man wearing a vest and covered in sweat. \"Yeeeah?\" you reply carefully, your voice coming out as the long nasally whine you hate so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you when you moved in? No bringing back any of your clients here, it\u2019s not that kind of place.\" Great, Amber must have been playing this whole hooker role for a while. Before you can correct him, Matt groans and reminds you need to get him inside. Besides, who will believe that you\u2019re not a hooker dressed like this and carrying a semi-conscious man. \"Also, you only paid me rent until tomorrow so make sure you bring me it tonight!\" The landlord slams his door as you drag Matt into the flea-bitten apartment. You stumble into the bedroom and drag Matt onto stained mattress on the bed. \"You lay there for a while dude. Hopefully they didn't do any real damage.\" You tell him in a high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look round the run-down apartment taking teetering steps in your heels. You would take them off but the floor is plain rough wood that echoes your every tiny step. The main room is split between a lounge and a kitchen. The lounge has a single brown stained two seated couch that\u2019s seen far better days and a old TV propped up on an upturned shipping box. The kitchen has a dirty cooker and an old refrigerator that sounds like its on its last legs. \"What a duuump!\" you exclaim to yourself. Well at least the rent should be cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the small bathroom you finally take off the hated shoes. As you do, you feel like you\u2019re coming down from stilts as your height returns to its now normal 5 foot 2 inches. You slip off the tiny latex micro skirt and pull off the green spandex top causing you monster tits to wobble madly before sitting on the toilet to answer the call of nature. Tears prick the corners of your eyes again as the urine dribbles out of your new parts, yet another reminder of your plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour long red hair stinks of the cum that\u2019s dried in it, matting the bangs together so you decide to take a shower. The hot water flows across your shoulders and your massive boobs as you soap up your tits, trying to wash off the shame of earlier. Looking down you see your \"Amber\" tattoo over your hip. You remember the first time Matt introduced you to Amber. He could have had anyone and he went for a cheap looking slut from the wrong side of town. You told him that she was only after his money. It was the only thing you ever argued about. She hated you from the start because you saw right through her act. She hated you even more when you caught her fucking some low life guy two days before the wedding. She begged you not to tell Matt and you agreed because you didn't want to see him hurt. If only you hadn't. Now you will spend the rest of your life as a cheap looking slut. \"Oh my Gaaawd! How could she do this to meeee!\" You explain in frustration. Not only do you have her high pitched nasally voice but you also have her annoying speech inflections and accent. Getting out of the shower you dry yourself with a grey towel and pull back on the hooker clothes from earlier. The latex skirt squeaks as you stretch it across your ass and no matter how hard you try you can't pull the top down far enough to cover up the slutty tattoo. Fucking tits! You already hate the monsters. It's unfortunate that they are the most valuable thing you own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the toilet you put back on the platform shoes, doing up the cheap green plastic straps. You try to tell yourself that its part of getting used to this life but the truth is that you hate being so short. You teeter into the kitchen with small mincing steps and wobbling tits. Finding some coffee in the cupboard you make yourself a cup and sit at the battered table. On the table is your plastic green purse and an ashtray. You've never smoked in your life but this body is dying for a cigarette. The taste of the coffee seems to make it worse. It's a disgusting habit but you decide that resisting will just make your life even worse. Fishing out the pack out the purse you flip the lid and out a long white cigarette. Putting the filter in your mouth you light the other end and wince as the horrible smoke fills you lungs. You cough slightly causing more tremors on your huge tits. \"eeeewwww!\" You whine but make no move to stub it out and instead hold it in between two fingers as you stare into space, smoking and contemplating your horrible future. You\u2019re now your best friend\u2019s wife. You have now money and some pretty bad guys will be looking for Matt. Your only qualifications are a pair of double FF enhanced breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily you stub out the cigarette in the ashtray. The after taste and nausea convinces you that will be the first and last one you ever smoke. But to your dismay you find yourself reaching for the pack just five minutes later. Matt walks in as you light up, dragging hard and blowing a long stream of smoke up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron....is that really you in there?\" He asks as he rubs the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it is!\" You respond harshly \"But it should be you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. I am so sorry....If I had any idea of what she was capable of I would never have...\" He stops in mid sentence as you glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You would never have married the cheap slut. Well thanks a lot, now I am the slut. Everything we worked for is gone.\" You whine bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know dude. I can't explain what\u2019s happened to me...Dude what\u2019s with the cigarette? You hate smoking.\" Matt frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeah well unfortunately Amber's body doesn't.\" You reply taking another hated drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so. She nearly gave up a while back.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess? She started smoking heavily again about a year ago?\" You shake your head. This was all part of her punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Matt looks away embarrassed. Neither of you can face what you did this morning. \"So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The engagement ring was worth a small fortune. Putting the cigarette in the ashtray, you pull off the rings over a manicured finger nails and hold them out to Matt, but he makes no move to take them. \"What\u2019s wrong? Take them? Sell your wedding ring as well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Amber....those are our wedding rings?\" he asks with tears in his eyes. After all that has happened. After everything she had done he\u2019s still in love with that bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019m not Amber! She stole my fucking body remember! Oh my Gaaaawd! I'm stuck here dressed like a $10 whore after blowing two guys this morning and your getting sentimental!\" You slam the rings down on the table and pick the cigarette back up taking a long drag and blowing out the smoke in angry puff. Catching sight of your reflection in the dirty kitchen window you realize you look and sound just like Amber was when she was being a bitch. Pinching the bridge of your small nose you try and calm down. \"Look just take the fucking rings and get some cash. We need to get out of town before those guys catch up with you and break your legs. OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt snaps out of it and holds your free hand in his. \"I'm sorry babe. I guess I'm just struggling to get used to this. I'll go get us some dinner for tonight and see what price I can get for the rings.\" he picks them up and to your embarrassment kisses you on the cheek as he gets up. You stutter to say something but he cuts you off. \"Sorry, just habit I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stub out the cigarette and as he walks towards the door. \"And buy me some more cigarettes!\" you call out after him. Did I really just yell that! You think to yourself. Fucking body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later there is a knock at the door just as your lighting yet another hated cigarette to help cope with the stress of the situation. \"What\u2019s he forgot?\" you say to yourself blowing out smoke and mincing towards the door, when you open it though it\u2019s not Matt but the fat sweaty guy landlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rent?\" he growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh weeellll my husband has just gone out to the baaank, he'll be back soon.\" You whine but the slob is having none of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that bullshit. Rent or fuck off.\" He snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have any money!\" You whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landlord slams the door behind him and pushes you easily into the bedroom. \"I knew you were a liability when I took you on. Now you owe me so you have a choice pack your skanky clothes and get out or pay with a little action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not a whore\" You start to protest but the fat slob is already pulling down his jeans and boxers to revel a stubby fat cock just poking out from beneath his hairy beer belly. Putting the cigarette in an ashtray on the bedside cabinet, you give in. You need a roof over your head and you can't afford to waste the money on a hotel so you pull off the skirt and top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No underwear aye, my kind of girl. Keep the shoes on slut they look great.\" He laughs and sits on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop to your knees and work his cock with your hands. It\u2019s like a fat little sausage and it\u2019s nowhere near as large as yours...yours was. After working some life into it you take your third cock of the day into your mouth, burying your face into the hairy rolls of fat as he fondles your tits. He stinks of BO and the taste of his cock tells you he hasn't washed it for a while. You blow him for a bit before he pulls you off painfully by your hair. \"No slut. I want some pussy today. Have you got any rubbers, I don't want to catch nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mince naked into the kitchen with your boobs jiggling. You hate they way you always have to hold you arms out for balance. Fetching a condom out of your purse you return to find him laying on the bed naked. The pig makes you pull on the condom onto his fat prick and then gestures to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on your hands and knees in front of the mirror. I want to watch those titties of yours jiggle as I fuck you.\" He says grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush with shame filling your veins as you obey. You feel the rough wood of the bare floor boards under your hands and knees as you point your wet pussy up towards him. He kicks your platform shoes apart and grabs each side of your butt. You feel him lifting his hairy beer belly up on to you back as his fat cock seeks out your new pussy. It's so short you only just feel him push it in. But it\u2019s fat enough for you to really feel it as he thrust harshly in and out making a wet sloppy noise from your pussy. It feels disgusting. Your first fuck as a woman and it\u2019s with an ugly overweight stinking slob. You feel sick at the reflection in the mirror of the ugly bastard making you jerk backwards and forwards. Only the sight of your own tits gives you any enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least pretend like you enjoy slut. I want my money\u2019s worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Gaaaawd! Oh yeesss! Harder, please Gaaawd Haaaarder!\" You moan hating yourself and wishing it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is over soon enough. The shit blows his load in the rubber and pulls out of you, slapping you wet ass as he does making you squeal. You stagger to you feet in the heels with your face burning in shame. Three cocks in your mouth and one fuck and it isn't even dinner time. You really are a slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig tugs off the rubber and tosses it at you, making it stick to you heaving creamy tits, emptying its slimy load onto your stomach. Laughing he gets dressed as you clean up in the bath room. \"That pays for another week. Cash next time or you\u2019re out.\" he says and opens the door. As he does Matt walks in with some grocery bags. \"That\u2019s a lovely wife you have there son!\" He laughs and walks off down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stares at you as you pull your slutty clothes back on with tears in your eyes. \"What just happened?!\" He gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get the cash?\" you ignore him and mince back into the kitchen. You can't talk about what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. They would only give me three hundred for the lot. The engagement ring is worth 10 grand alone. Wait a minute, don't change the subject what did you do/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I paid the fucking rent!\" you scream at him and pick up the cigarettes, lighting one with shaking hands. The vile taste mixes with the lingering taste of cock in your mouth. \"Oh my Gaaawd! Whaaat did I just doooo!\" You collapse into tears at the table sobbing as Matt holds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there babe, I\u2019m sorry, I'll get us some money soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your babe!\" You whine through the tears but with little malice this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some pizza, eaten in an awkward silence you both decide to go to bed. Mentally and physically exhausted from the day\u2019s events your too tired to care that your getting into bed naked with your best friend. In the dark he holds you as you weep some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s okay honey. I've always loved you as a best friend. Now you\u2019re my wife I promise to sort this problem out and be the husband you deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA statement just makes you cry harder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you and Matt can't look at each other. After a shower you walk over to closet and open it. You heart sinks as you see the contents. On each hanger is an outfit, each one sluttier than the last. You hoped that Karen had been exaggerated this part but no such luck, each outfit would make even a hooker blush. Since it doesn't make a difference you settle for a hot pink latex tube dress. It\u2019s so tight you struggle to pull it up over your tits. When you do, you realize that you ass cheeks peep out of the bottom. You sigh. It\u2019s better than being naked and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going out. You turn to the shoes. There\u2019s hundreds of them every cheap looking pair has a platform sole and at least a 5 inch heel. You pick out a pair of clear plastic stripper shoes, which are amazingly the most understated, at least you not so short when you put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's jaw drops as you mince into the kitchen but a withering look makes sure he doesn't comment. \"We need cash Matt. If $300 is all you can get then that we'll have to do. We need to get out of town and I need a change of clothes. This is the most respectable outfit I could find in the closet. I'll get arrested for streetwalking if I go outside.\" You whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighs. \"Just let me take a look around town. I must be able to find a better price for the jewelry. Then we can get you some clothes and maybe get to my sisters on the coast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No waaaaay\" You say fishing a cigarette out of the pack and searching for a lighter. \"I don't want to be around anyone who knows us. I don't want anyone to know what\u2019s happened to me.\" You light the cigarette and suck hard. It tastes disgusting but feels so good to have your first of the day. You have always had a crush on Matt\u2019s sister Jen and the thought of her seeing you reduced to this makes you sick. You always hoped that you would get together but she always hated Amber\u2019s guts and she would never want you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she might be able to help!\" Matt pleads<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only two people could help us and they won't. It\u2019s time to face facts, as much as I hate them. I am Amber now. I am your wife. I promise you that once we're out of here we'll set up somewhere else and I'll try to be the wife you want, even though it makes me feel sick thinking about it. But in return you have to get me somewhere safe. You owe someone half a million Matt! If they catch you we're dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it\u2019s not as bad as that. I only owe about $50 grand. I told Amber $500 million because I thought she was trying to divorce me. I needed to pretend the bank took the apartment so she wouldn't try and get it. In fact I sold it to pay off most my debt with Jimmy.\" He admitted. \"Maybe Jen can lend us that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and blow out the horrible smoke. \"I don't know whether you lying or not anymore Matt. I guess this is how it feels to be Amber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm sorry. I'll be back later with some cash and then we'll figure out where to go.\" Matt gets up, kisses you on the cheek and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day hanging around the apartment watching shit TV and smoking. Every so often you get up and mince to a mirror to look in disbelief at your new body. She really did a number on you. Long red hair frames a face that you have hated for years and hangs down onto huge creamy white breasts. The latex tube dress is stretched like second skin across that hour glass figure and barely covers a pussy that seems to be permanently wet. Imagine what Jen will say if she sees you like this. She always used make you laugh by referring to her as the \"whiney slut\". Well now that\u2019s you, maybe its karma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating some left over pizza for lunch you start to worry about Matt. He has been gone for 4 hours. Just as you start to think about risking a trip to the phone box you hear the door open. \"Thank Gaaawd I was really worried about you\" You hate the way you always say that. Just as you turn Matt falls through the kitchen door with blood pouring from his nose, closely followed by two men dressed in sharp suits. One of them is huge with bulging biceps stretching out the arms of his suit. The other is smiling around 35 years old and has a slightly weasel look to his face with his hair slicked back. \"You must be Amber\" He says holding out a hand. \"I'm Jimmy\". You take his hand and instead of shaking it he lifts it to his lips and plants a disgustingly wet kiss on the back of it. Still holding your hand he slips on the engagement ring and wedding ring in a manner that makes your skin crawl. \"These are yours I believe. May we sit down?\" he asks. You nod and he and the big guy take the only two seats leaving you to stand awkwardly wondering whether you should help Matt who is moaning on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going kill us?\" You ask in a frightened voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, why would I do that? Because your loser husband has tried to run out of town without paying me the last $50 grand? I wouldn't kill someone for that. Rocko, would you kill someone for that?\" He asks in mock horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably boss.\" the man mountain rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about Rocko; he's a bit nuts but a softy at heart.\" He smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want then?\" You whine shifting uncomfortably form one platform shoe to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are my manners?\" Jimmy exasperates. \"Here take a seat darling.\" he says pushing his chair out and gestures to his lap. Slowly you lower yourself on to his lap, sitting sideways like a kid would sit on Santa's knee. Jimmy puts one hand round you back and starts playing with your hair whilst the other strokes the inside of your thigh. \"My my, Matt if you had told me you had such a fine piece of ass for a wife I would have come around long ago\". Matt starts to protest through the blood running down his face but Jimmy cuts him off. \"Rocko, I'm trying to talk to the little lady here, if Matt talks again break his jaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing boss,\" Rocko says without as much as a pause. You\u2019re so scared your shaking and you can feel Jimmy's erection pushing into you bare butt through his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then Amber. I'll tell you how it is. I don't kill people who owe me money, It\u2019s bad business. They struggle to pay it back when their dead. If Matt here was no use to me then I maybe I would leave him to spend the rest of his life eating through a straw as a warning, but Matt's a very clever guy. He's down on his luck but I'm sure with a little motivation he can find a cushy job and pay me back quickly. And that\u2019s where you come in sweetie. You\u2019re going to come and work for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work for you?\" You ask with a quivering voice. \"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I want you to install a new CCTV system! What do you think I want you to do? I want you to join my girls\" Jimmy laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be a...stripper?\" You ask in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the time sure, But I make more money out my girls in other ways.\" Jimmy laughs at you horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be a whooore!\" you squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo! And there\u2019s the beauty of it. The sooner Matty boy pays up the sooner his wife gets to stop sucking dick and being fucked by strangers. What better incentive can you ask for!\" Jimmy laughs and squeezes a boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" You yell and jump up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, Rocko throw the slut out of the window and then throw that loser out. Maybe her airbags will break his fall.\" Rocko gets up making you scream and back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute. Pleeease...we'll pay you back I promise!\" You beg, but Rocko grabs your arm and drags you screaming towards the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! OK! Please stop, I'll do it just don't hurt me!\" You whine crying pathetically. Rocko lets go of you and jimmy gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great stuff sweet cheeks. Come to my club at eight. Matt knows the address and if you think about leaving tonight I will hunt you down and you will regret it. Got it? Good. Now give me some sugar.\" You walk over to your new boss and stand on the tip toes of your platform shoes to kiss him. You want to kill him as he grabs the back of your head and gives you a long French kiss before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shaking hands you light a cigarette. You have just agreed to be a hooker. Matt gets up and starts to say something but you hold up a finger with along nail to cut him off. \"Please Matt. Don't say anything. Just go out tomorrow, get a Job and get me out of this nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just four hours you start your new job<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You guess your clothes won't stay on for long anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the club you crush out a cigarette under the platform heel. Rocko is standing at the door and nods as you arrive. The guy towers over you and gestures you to follow him through the dark smokey club. It's empty, with the exception to some busty girls walking around, your new colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to an office and Rocko knocks on the door. \"Amber's here boss\" he rumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show her in please.\" Rocko opens the door and you totter into the office. Jimmy sits grinning behind a desk. There's no chair on your side. \"Hi Amber, Thanks for coming. Here's the deal. You don't get paid for working here like some of the girls I'll knock your earnings off of what your husband owes me. But I'm not totally heartless so I will let you keep your tips understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jimmy.\" You squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s Mr. Greeno or Boss to you, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss.\" you respond with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Can you dance?\u201d you shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well you are going to learn, until then your work the tables as a topless waitress. With those monsters you will still earn some good tits. Later on will see if anyone wants to party with you. If they do, you show them a good time. I don't do refunds. Got it?\" he barks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss\" you\u2019re close to tears now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Rocko take Amber to Kat and ask her to get her for ready tonight.\" Rocko leads you outside and behind a huge stage with a run way. Behind the stage is a messy dressing area with an assortment of half naked woman chatting, smoking and touching up make up. Rocko guides you over to a tall brunette wearing a leather bustier and panties with fish net tights and shiny black stripper shoes. \"Hey Kat, here\u2019s the new girl\" Rocko shouts. The woman walks over smiling. \"Thanks Rocko honey. Hi Sweetie you must be Amber, I'm Kat I run thing back here and upstairs. You ever danced before?\" You shake your head gazing at the gorgeous woman. If only you were still a man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey. Jimmy told me your story. I know it\u2019s rough babe but we'll make you feel at home. Crystal and Candy are our best dancers, during the day they will train you up. I'm sure I don't need to tell you what to do upstairs!\" Kat laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think someone will want me to...well you know...tonight\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get upset babe. Rocko makes sure they play nice. You might even enjoy it. Now let\u2019s get you out of the delightful dress and ready for tonight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are dressed in just a sparkly thong that barely covers the tables and the platform stripper shoes you have worn all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air is so smokey you can barely see the stage on which Crystal is dancing expertly round a pole. You\u2019re dying for a cigarette yourself but you\u2019re only allowed a break every two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go siiirrr.\" you whine as you put a tray of drinks down on a table of six guys. As you do some of the beer slops up soaking you\u2019re heaving bare tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there!\" One guy laughs. He is about 25 and obviously a young business man trying to impress some clients. Once upon a time it would have been you he would have been taking out and trying to impress with seedy strippers. But your now longer the business man. You\u2019re just the seedy stripper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...erm... Amber.\" He says running his finger over your trampy tattoo. \"Maybe I'll see you later?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so siiirrr.\" You fix a grin on your face and turn to take another order, feeling more humiliation as the guy slaps your ass cheek. It\u2019s going to be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy 2am you\u2019re exhausted. You sit at the side of the stage smoking a hated cigarette and watching one of the girls lap dance for a client. You wish she was doing it on you. You always enjoyed getting a lap dance. Instead in a few weeks that would be you dancing for some slime ball. You sigh and see Kat gesturing for you to come over. Mincing over to her you smile. Kat's been really nice to you. If you were still a guy you would bang her in no time but you don't possess the equipment anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Amber dear. Good job on the floor work. Now one guy has asked for a party. He is waiting in room 5. If he gets out of hand just shout and Rocko well take care of him.\" She takes your face in your hands gently and to your surprise kisses you on the lips. \"Don't you fret, it\u2019s just sex. You do it all the time. This guy is quite good looking anyway. Just do it and forget about it. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod trying to be brave. Mincing up the stairs you feel like condemned man. Rocko is reading a paper in the hall way. You can hear sounds of people having sex behind each door. He sees you, gets up and opens a door and gestures for you to go in. Sitting on the bed naked is the young businessman from earlier. It had to be didn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amber, care to join me.\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir\" You squeak. You hate being a woman. If you were still a guy you could beat him to a pulp. Instead you just resign yourself to your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please call me John.\" He says as you sit down. He kisses you on the mouth and fondles your huge tits as you moan gently. Inside you want to curl up and die. After ten minutes of making out he pushes you down on the bed and pulls off your thong. \"Are you ready babe?\" he asks slipping on a condom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah John I'm ready.\" You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Lifts up your legs pulls them part and holds them up in the air whilst he plunges his rock hard cock into your new part. \"Oh Gaaaawd!\" you cry out, this time for real. \"Oh Gaaawd, Oh fuck, oh Gaaawd please Gaaawd.\" You sound like the whore you are but you can't help it. John is sweating as he slams in and out, driving you towards orgasm. \"Of fuck yeeeesss. Oooooh Gaaaawd!\" You moan hating your whiny nasally voice more than ever. Why did she have to do this to you? Why was Matt such a moron? Why didn't you stop him from marrying that slut? The torture seems to last forever. It feels so good but you want to puke you\u2019re so disgusted. You scream as the orgasm finally hits and John shoots his load. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there on the dirty bed with your platform shoes still held up in the air, panting as John grins down on you. You\u2019re disgusted with yourself. 48 hours ago you went to bed as a ripped wealthy young man trying to decide which Caribbean island to buy a house on and spend the rest of your life surrounded by bikini wearing babes. Instead your in the body of Amber your friends huge breasted slut of a wife, being whored out to whoever pays. Worse you just enjoyed it. You want to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber you are worth every penny babe! I'm so glad I paid for the rest of my clients to party with you as well!\" John says as your eyes widen in shock. The rest of his clients! That\u2019s five more guys!. \"Well I guess there your clients as well now!\" He jokes as he dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely have time to clean up before the next guy knocks on the door. \"Come in?\" You say in a shaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is hell<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your ankles and tiny feet are in agony from walking in these ridiculous heels. Matt is still up and he looks at you full of concern, but you can't meet his eyes. Instead you mince into the bedroom and sit heavily on the bed, making your sweat soaked breasts quiver and squeak in there hot pink latex prison. \"Babe... are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't dignify that question with a response so you just look at him, too tired to even bend down and take off your shoes. He gets the message and drops to his knees to fumble with the straps on the heels. \"So how was it?\" he asks like you have just got a new job in a supermarket. Tiredness and the shame from the nights activities make you snap a sarcastic response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let me see, I served drinks topless for 6 hours dressed in a tiny thong while people fondled my tits and pinched my ass. Then I went upstairs and was fucked by six guys in every position you can imagine. But it\u2019s ok because tomorrow I learn how to pole-dance and lap-dance for slime ball who, if I'm lucky, we'll pay to fuck me, Fucking job of my dreams Honey. I don't know why I wasted all those years earning millions. I'm sooooo glad it\u2019s all gone and I'm left as a fucking hooker . I'm soooo glad you got me into this!\" You say in your hated nasally whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stops after taking off a shoe and stares wide-eyed. His mouth working as tries to think of something to say but instead just reaches for your other shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Gaaawd, my feet are killing me\" you moan. Matt starts to give you a foot rub and it is heaven. You lay back with a moan as he massages your feet perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you get undressed babe\" he says as you are starting to drift off, too exhausted to resist. The latex tube dress is hard to pull off and Matt is forced to kneel over you to tug it off, causing your double FF boobs to bounce as they are finally released. Six guys have suckled on those monsters tonight and you barely notice when Matt starts to do the same. In fact it\u2019s only when he starts kissing your mouth you realize what happening and push his head away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing Matt!\" You screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm just trying to help.\" He asks red face. \"God, you fuck six strangers for money but you won't let your husband make love to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Gaaawd! How many times have I told you! I'm not really your wife! I'm a guy! Your best friend!\" You rub your eyes in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said earlier you would try to be the wife I wanted? How would you feel if your wife came in having given herself to a bunch of strangers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I enjoyed tonight? It was hell, but I did it for you! To keep you from spending your life in a wheelchair! Matt...I mean Fuck man. It's me Aaron in here. You don't have to prove your manhood to me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay\" Matt holds up his hands. \"Sorry man. I just haven't had sex in a while and you come in looking like.... that... and well....I still love her man.\" he says as sobs rack his body. This is too much, you really don't need this. You sit up and put a petit arm round him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt. I'm not Amber; I just look like her now. She was bad news man.\" You say gently \"Fuck man! Look what she did to me!\" You exclaim pointing at your enormous tits \"I was guy with millions in the bank and the world at my feet and now I'm a fucking big-titted whore!

Between the two horrible habits that Amber so generously stuck you with, you were fixing to be sick, apparently even though your body wants it, it still tastes bad. After forcing yourself through a cup of coffee and a cigarette, you go to the bathroom to wash the horrible taste out of your mouth, and it actually made you feel better, until you looked in the mirror and remembered you were a half naked, big breasted bimbo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear the door open, which makes you cringe in fear and pray that it\u2019s not the landlord coming to collect the \u201crent\u201d again!

You then stop, \"Hey, up here.\" you say, \"Ah sorry, but yea and i got a nice advance, for signing.\" he says, \"Wow really how much?\" you ask, \"Well its not enough to pay off Jimmy, but we'll be able to eat for a while.\" he says, \"But when i finish this job we will.\" He says, \u201cOh so how much longer do you think it\u2019ll be?\u201d you ask </span></div></div>",

A woman stopped before you, her eyes sympathetic. You notice that everyone was avoiding this unbelievably hot, woman. There was an aura about her. \" Are you ok?\" she asked in a voice identical to her lookalike Emilia Clarke. She was even blonde unlike the real Wmilia who was dark haired. You almost cried in response when she gave you a hug. \"They are evil, aren't they!\" she proposed. You broke away, nodding. \"I hate men, so much!\" you whispered back. It was true, Jimmy, the club patrons, ex Amber and Matt. All were total scum. She beamed at you, handing you a bottle of clear liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drank it eagerly, not caring anymore. You felt your hatred expand as you contemplated your situation. You wanted blood. You didn't care whose. So long as a man died, that was all that mattered. \"Here!\" declared the woman, handing you a needle. You grinned, thanking her profusely. \"I am your sister, Erin. Make the inferior pay!\" she replied. You don't know how you knew, but you did. The door fell away and Jimmy's throat was in your hands. \"Time to pay, inferior!\" you exclaimed. He struggled against your hand, but all to no avail. \"Ready, filth?\" you giggled as you slowly moved the injection device towards his neck. You enjoyed his futile action as the needle entered him. You should have more surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after you become Amber, it all fit. Jimmy shimmered as you dropped him. You smile as his transformation began. The hair, the chest, the backside and above all the privates. In no time, Jimmy was Amber. A gentle slap rendered him unconscious. \"Enjoy your new life, whore!\" you whispered, giggling. \"A quick disguise for you, sister.\" Offered Erin. It was a silver bracelet. You trusted your new hero as you put it on. To your surprise, you were now Jimmy. You turned to thank her, but she disappeared. You called for a guard to wake the new Amber up. \"I'm leaving for the day. This girl is yours till 1!\" you offered, hiding your glee as he eyes her over. \"Thanks, boss!\" he replied as he woke her up with a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the club, feeling pleased when you realised there was something in your jacket pocket. You grinned, it's time for revenge.</span></div></div>",

You took out his bank card, withdrawing a surprising large sum of 100K in 100 bills. You weren't surprised that you were able to withdraw so much. The extraordinary was now simply part of your life. Keeping the money in your briefcase, you headed towards your apartment. \"Wouldn't Matt get a shock?\" You thought, grinning as you held the needle's plunger in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wasted no time, enjoying the burst of speed that you know had. It took less than 5 minutes to get from the ATM to the apartment door. With relish, you reduced the door to ribbons. \"Jimmy!! I...I'm working towards g-g-getting you the m-m/money!!! Please don't hurt Amber because of me!\" he squealed. \"Time's up, buddy!\" you replied, grabbing him by the collar. He whimpered, again pleading for Amber. You were getting annoyed by his cries, his gutlessness. You show him the needle and he went white with fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either you or your girl gets it. Who do you want to take it?\" you threatened him. \"Me! I'll take, just spare Amber. She deserves to be free!\" You jabbed him quickly in the neck, not liking how his response made you feel. Pity for him. He screamed as the change took him. It was odd, Jimmy didn't scream at all. You watched as a beautiful blonde (Allison Mack) rose in his place. You felt touched and debated whether or not to take off the bracelet. \"Where's my wife??? Tell me where my wife is!!!!\" she yelled, her fists balled up. You felt so overwhelmed by new feelings that you threw the bracelet to the floor, wrapping her around you. She replied in kind, happy to be with you again.</span></div></div>",

But recently when things seem too good to be true it\u2019s because they are.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fair enough, and to be honest since you are indebted to me I could have made you do it. But I\u2019m really not that bad; you see I\u2019m doing you a favor, this job pays a lot better than working here so you\u2019ll be able to pay off Matt\u2019s debt a lot faster, and by working for my friend you will be doing me a favor, so I\u2019ll be doing my friend a favor and then he will owe me a favor. So what do you think?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what to say, on the one hand it really did sound too good to be true, but on the other hand this might be the first real break you\u2019ve gotten since you woke up in Amber\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay ill do it.\u201d You say, \u201cBeautiful, now I had some paperwork drawn up to make everything official. \u201c he says guiding you to a piece of paper on his desk. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You glared at Matt, while he slept. He truly was a stupid, selfish man. If only he was a beautiful woman, then maybe you could handle this better. Maybe someone like Jamie Chung (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/still/dragonball36.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/still/d...</a>). You took out the contract and read it. It took all of 2 minutes to realise that you were duped. You wouldn\u2019t keep any of the money, which would be prorated into the debt to the tune of $5 for every $100. You had to provide advertisement videos of girls strapping you up! You can\u2019t believe you trusted that bastard Jimmy. It also said that refusal to engage in services as required by the customer would be an automatic increase of $10,000 per offense. That could keep you in his debt for years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tremble, feeling tears burning near the edge of your eyes. You fought to keep them back, you hated how helpless you were. You really hated men with a passion. If you could, you would kill them all! \u201cIt\u2019s ok to cry, sister!\u201d You spun around, gasping to see 5 beautiful women staring back at you. You took a step back, frightened at being so outnumbered. \u201cPeace, sister. We mean you no harm! We are here to help you!\u201d declared the one who spoke to you, earlier. She was tiny, blonde, blue eyed and familiar. She looked a help of a lot like the Game of Thrones chick, Emilia Clarke. \u201cH-How you do that? Who are you? Do you work for\u2026\u201d \u201cWe want to help you be free from your prison, Amber. We know how you ended up this way. We wish to help you as you are now one of us. A superior being trapped by a number of worthless inferiors! I too know the pain of your current predicament!\u201d revealed the blonde, lifting her left hand. A large red ruby ring was on that hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having never seen something like this, somehow you knew what the ring actually was. A rape survivor ring. \u201cH-How can you help?\u201d you stammered. The blonde turned to one of the other girls. \u201cAlana, please show her the bag.\u201d Alana looked just like a young Megan Fox from Transformers. \u201cHere you go, Amber! Amber is a funny name. Like my wife Brandy (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dvdbash.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/desperate-housewives-dvd-s1-nicollette-sheridan-edie-britt-005-dvdbash.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://dvdbash.files.wordpress.com/2012...</a>) who is so hot, that we have lesbian sex every time\u2026\u201d \u201cThank you, Alana. Please enjoy the gifts, my dear sister! Come sisters, beloved!\u201d declares the interrupting, little blonde pausing only to kiss a taller blonde (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Tamzin_merchant2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a>).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything, they disappeared. You stared at the space for a moment, before realising that you had the bag in your hands. It wasn\u2019t a dream. More witches! It scared you for a moment, before you remember their leader, the little blonde had a rape survivor ring on her hand. And three of them at least were lesbian. You opened the bag, seeing nothing but black space\u2026and no bottom. You spy something, reaching in. It was a strange concoction in a plastic container. An inscription was written, reading \u201cTo turn an inferior into a member of the superior gender.\u201d You widened at this before smiling. A chance for revenge at last. You noticed Matt sleeping. \u201cPlease let this turn him into a woman, preferably a Jamie Chung lookalike!\u201d  The only part of that idiot Dragonball movie worth watching was her performance as Chi-Chi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently poured a few drops on the man you were forced to be married to. He glowed briefly before becoming an exact lookalike for Jamie Chung. Your heart leapt, you approached her pants before stopping. That was wrong. You weren\u2019t a rapist, you just wanted to be with a woman again. And now that Matt was a woman, the gangsters couldn\u2019t get to him! But they could use you instead or force Matt into the same thing. You couldn\u2019t let that happen. A note fell from the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations, Amber! You are a true member of the superior gender, refusing to treat another with cruelty and violence! Inside the bag is a bracelet. It will allow you to impersonate one of the inferior leaders. Also inside is a teleporter in the shape of a Rolex watch. It will help you. Finally, there is a plunger containing chemicals that will turn him into your double. This will allow him to experience a very different perspective. <br>\r\nYours sincerely,<br>\r\nYour Sister Erin Jade Merchant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the note again, somewhat stunned. So her name is Erin Jade Merchant and she gave you a magic bag of goodies. You put on the bracelet, changing into Jimmy. You bite back a squeal, you don\u2019t want to wake up Matt. You are tempted to try out your new manhood, but dismissed it just as quickly. After being on the receiving end, you never wanted to acknowledge a man again, let alone be one. \u201cI\u2019ll be back Mattie! Sleep tight, sweetheart!\u201d you declared, surprised that the voice was your current voice, rather than Jimmy\u2019s. You are worried about leaving Matt on her own. Anything could happen to her here, so defenceless. Another note appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read it and beamed. You took off the bracelet, returning to yourself. You took a minute and drank the strange liquid. You feel a surge of energy. It was hard to describe like a rocket exploded inside your body. Matt Chung is as light as a feather, a grin spreads across her beautiful face as she begging giggling in her sleep. You are a little surprised, before you realise your fingers crept into her underarms. \u201cTicklish are we?\u201d you teased, moving your fingers away in case she wake up. You put on the Rolex, not sure what will happen. You see lights in various colours until you notice a queen size bed. Another note is on the bed. \u201cThis is the home of Amber and Matilda Norrington. She will be safe here. Welcome home, Amber! <br>\r\nYours Sincerely,<br>\r\nYour Sister Erin Jade Merchant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beam, gently helping Mattie into the bed. You kiss her forehead, before putting on the bracelet. Jimmy is sleeping in his large bed. You move quickly, taking out the plunger and entering it into his skin. He didn\u2019t even stir as he changed into Amber. You grin, grabbing her roughly. She still didn\u2019t make a sound, so you focus on your teleporter. You leave Amber Jimmy to her fate, taking Jimmy\u2019s wallet away. You beam at the thought of leaving her to the contract. \u201cEnjoy your new life, Amber!\u201d you declare. You teleport away as Amber Jimmy\u2019s eyes fluttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s dark when you empty Jimmy\u2019s account and take out the money from the club\u2019s safe. $553,678 dollars was now yours. They would think Jimmy ran away with all the money. How stupid were the club owners to leave Jimmy with $460,000 in the club! It didn\u2019t matter now as you teleported back into the house and threw the bracelet into the bag. You never wanted to be a man again. You made your way towards Mattie. \u201cMattie, wake up darling! It\u2019s Amber, I\u2019m home!\u201d Mattie stirred, before opening her eyes. \u201cHi Mattie, my love! How are you feeling?\u201d \u201cA lot better seeing you! I am still sorry about the mess that we\u2026.What\u2019s wrong with my\u2026\u201d You cut her off with a long kiss. She melted into the embrace, matching your passion with her own. \u201cForget the how, Mattie! All that matters is that we are in love and free!\u201d you declare. </span></div></div>",

You look over and see Matt still tied in the chair. He's sleeping now. \"Matt, Matt\", You call out while lifting yourself off the floor. The sound of your voice grates on your nerves. You go over to Matt and give him a shake. His eyes open and you remove the gag before working on the knots. It's a good thing Amber works out, because the knots are tight. \"We've got to catch up with that bitch and get my body back\", you say removing the last bit of rope. Matt knods his head and replies with, \"I think I know where they might be going. Amber always wanted to honeymoon in Hawaii\". You pause for a second. Matt doesn't seem all the freaked out. In fact he seems pretty calm. That's not like him. You shrug it off and say, \"Ok, I'm going to secure my bank account and check my credit cards. You book us tickets to Hawaii. Then we'll head over to your house and pack some clothes real quick. With any luck we won't be to far behind them\". You check your accounts. Amber did access then less than an hour ago and withdrew a large sum of cash. Strangely she didn't take it all. In fact she didn't even take half. You open another account online and move the rest of the cash around. She won't be able to access the rest not knowing what bank it's in, or the account numbers. The bank must have been short on cash, or she didn't feel rushed. She is now. It would only take her showing up with your ID and answering some questions. She probably researched you life some before doing this. \"I booked us on the next flight\", Matt shouts while re-entering the room. You log off and get up to go. You have to look up to Matt now. He notices you looking and asks, \"What's wrong\"? \"It's just that, damn. Amber is short\", you replie. Matt laughs and says, \"You mean you're short\". You frown and say, \"Not funny, lets go\". You head out, get in the car, and head to Matt's house.</span></div></div>",

As you're finishing up, Matt comes down the stairs and says, \"If you're finished you should go change into something a little more suited for flying.  I put a couple of outfits on the bed that Amber would wear on an airplane.  Sorry if they're a bit... tight, but you've seen the stuff she wears.\"  He tries to look apologetic but something in his look makes you think he isn't all that sincere about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to run upstairs, cursing how the large masses on your chest bounce as you move.  A part of you thinks about some of the times you've seen women running with larger breasts and wonder why you ever thought it was sexy when it feels so awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get upstairs and go into the bedroom.  On the bed are two outfits.  The first is a light pink colored dress that probably goes to your knees, now that you are only 5'2\".  The top looks like it probably shows off a lot of cleavage.  Matt also laid out a lacy pink bra and panty set and some sandals.  The second outfit is a dark green pleated mini-skirt and a black pull over top that probably looks tight but at least has a smaller hole for the head which means the cleavage won't be showing for the whole world to see.  A pair of high healed boots and black thong and bra set finish off this outfit.  You sigh, wondering what evil you committed in another life to be forced to make a choice like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Matt yell from downstairs.  \"Hurry up, we need to get to the airport!\"  You realize you have no time to spare and start to pick up an outfit.</span></div></div>",

With only a little bit of trouble, namely the tits, you get the bra, panties, and dress on. You have to feel around with your feet to get the sandles on because you can't see anything past your breasts. As you race down the stairs you murmur to yourself, \"These things are fucking rediculous huge. Why the fuck did she go this big\"? Granted you always liked big tits and they were Amber's best feature, but what the fuck. \"Why would any woman do this to herself\", you think to yourself. When you make it to the bottom of the stairs Matt hands you a large purse. \"What's this\", you ask. \"It's Amber's purse. It has her ID in it, cell phone, and everthing. You'll need it to get on the plane\", Matt replies. \"Why would she leave her purse behind and her phone. She was attached to that thing\", you fire back? Matt just shrugs and says, \"Probably figured she didn't need it anymore. She is you now after all. Her purse and old phone won't do her much good\". You accept his answer for now even though it sounds out of character for Amber. She's a pretty stingy bitch. You figured she would have trashed all her stuff just to give you a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon you're on your way to the airport. You can't help but watch you breasts jiggle with every bump in the road. You'll need to make a point of checking yourself out better before switching back.

The mad dash to through ticketing and to security wasn't so bad, but the one guy watching you move through the security gate made you nervous.  You know that he couldn't have patted you down but he looked like he wanted to do just that.  You try to put the guard out of your mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt got the two of you First Class tickets and you move to take the window seat.  The seats are more comfortable than you remember.  \"Wow, they must have just remodeled the plane or something.\" You comment to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt is just sitting down and adjusting his seat belt.  \"Why do you say that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at all this room!\" You move your legs and snuggle into the large seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughs and when he sees your confused look, he says, \"The seats haven't gotten larger, you're in a much smaller body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your cheeks redden in embarrassment.  Before you can say anything else, he motions to the flight attendant and tells you he's going to have a drink.  \"Would you like something?  Amber doesn't fly well and a few drinks usually helps with the air sickness.  Since you're in her body, you might need it.\"  The grin on his face makes you wonder if he's taking this trip to find her as seriously as you are.  But you nod and he orders a rum and diet coke for you and a beer for him without asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I would have liked a beer.\" You growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you know, that's always what Amber orders and it's just habit I guess.  Tell you what, if you don't like it, I'll trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your voice down so only Matt can hear you.  \"You need to stop thinking of me like I'm really her.  I know you always liked her body, hell, I like her body.  But hopefully I'm not the total bitch she is so stop treating me like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant brings the drinks.  Matt makes a half-hearted 'cheers' and takes a drink.  You take a sip and figure it's good enough.  Matt looks at you and says, \"I know this sucks for you, but we might as well have a few drinks, a few laughs, and enjoy the trip.  When we find him... um... Amber in your body... we'll get everything changed back and then laugh about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a grunt, that doesn't really sound like a grunt coming from your mouth, and reply, \"I don't know what there is to laugh about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt takes a drink.  \"Well, think of it from my point of view.  I get to hang out with my best friend and I get to look at my wife's amazing body.  For me, that's the vacation of a lifetime.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at his smirk and want to knock it off of his face.  Instead, you finish the drink and tell him, \"As long as you don't get any funny ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pats your knee as the attendant waits on the passengers right in front of you.  \"Oh come on, we'll be in Hawaii, drinking tropical drinks, and enjoying the beautiful beaches.  It's me that needs to worry about you getting ideas in your head.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt touching your knee causes you to jump a bit.  You can feel your cheeks reddening again and all you can do is mumble, \"Yeah, right.\"  But the thought of laying on a beach does sound appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, the plane takes off and you're airborne.  After another drink, you start to relax.  Matt and your conversation turns to other topics.  You even forget for a bit why you are going to Hawaii.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart-way through the trip, and a few drinks later, he leans over and whispers in your ear, \"Admit it, you're kind of enjoying this aren't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the alcohol affecting your thinking, but not so much that you are going to admit it.  \"Why would I enjoy this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get to find out what a woman really thinks and feels.  Imagine the possibilities!  You are the keeper of the box!  You get to decide when it gets opened.\" He chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis comment makes you think.  This could be a new experience.  Maybe you could spend a little time exploring some female sensations.  You think about sex for a minute and feel tingly between your thighs.  You squirm a bit.  Matt looks like he's about to say something but you glare at him and he has the decency to keep quiet.</span></div></div>",

I know that Hawaii isn't that big but there are a ton of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about that.  I figured that we'd do everything Amber would have done if we'd come here together instead of you and me.  So that means hitting the beach, parties, and shopping spots.  In other words, we'd probably have the best luck if you start acting like Amber and thinking like her.\"  You think he has a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't get any funny ideas, I'm not going to do EVERYTHING that she did.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs and laughs it off.  \"Can't blame a guy for trying to get his wife into bed.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis statement is so forward that it takes you by surprise.  You feel a little thrill go through your body as the thought of laying naked in a bed passes through your fuzzy brain.  You shake your head and then mean to give him hell for that statement but he's already grabbing a taxi for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes, you arrive at a nice hotel.  He goes up to the counter while you wait with the baggage.  After a short wait, he leads you to the elevator and you go to an upper floor.  When he opens the door, you are surprised by a large honeymoon suite with a couple of vases of red roses and a bottle of champagne chilling.  Your first thought is, \"How romantic!\"  Then you blink, wondering where that thought came from.  You turn to Matt and glare.  \"What the hell is this!\" You demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt backpedals a bit.  \"Hold on, I had a hell of a time trying to get a room.  I finally made up a story about us being newlyweds and lifelong dream and shit like that.  Next thing I knew I had this room.  I didn't know about the champagne and stuff.\" He flashes that irritating grin at you.  It makes you angrier.  \"Listen, why don't you go freshen up...\" he sees you glare at that obvious 'female' term but continues, \"... and I'll pour some champagne.  We might as well enjoy it since I'm paying for it anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou storm into the bathroom and use the toilet.  While you wash up, you notice your hair could use a brush.  Before you realize it, you have grabbed a brush out of your purse and brush your hair.  \"That's better.\"  You smile into the mirror and your head seems a bit clearer.  \"Why in the fuck did I just do that?\" You ask yourself.  Then you go into the main room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt has two glasses of champagne ready.  Handing you one he clinks the glasses.  \"To Hawaii!\"  He sips it.  You are too frustrated to even comment.  You swallow it all in one drink and Matt takes your glass to refill it.  \"You ought to look at the view.\" He comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here on vacation.\" You growl at him.  \"You might think it's a big joke but I don't.\" But you move to the window and reluctantly admit it is nice.  You hear him pour more into your glass.  He comes up behind you and hands you the glass.  You finish it a bit slower this time.  \"Damn, my head is getting fuzzy again.\" You mumble.  You are aware that Matt is very close to you, almost touching, and it feels nice.  You shake your head no, trying to get rid of the thoughts, when his arms wrap around you from behind around your waist.  You start to turn around and yell at him.  Before you can yell, he gives you a kiss.  To your surprise it feels nice.  You feel a flutter in your belly and kiss back.  Then your senses return. \"What are you doing?\" You gasp as you break the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me.  It just seemed to be the right time to kiss you.\"  And he gives you a bigger kiss.</span></div></div>",

Your large breasts press against him.  His hands start to move along your back and you feel him start to tug on the zipper of your dress.  This causes you to clear your head and you stop the kiss.  \"What the fuck do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about his smile sends shivers into your belly.  \"Like I said, you need to act and think like Amber.  This will help, I promise.  You have to admit you want to know what a female orgasm feels like.\"  Before you can respond, he kisses you and pulls the zipper down and expertly undoes your bra clasp.  The next thing you know your tits are exposed and Matt has his hands on them.  A small part of your brain screams that these are not your tits and that this needs to stop.  But the thrills going through your body makes you want more.  Matt pushes the dress down and starts to undo his shirt and pants.  This happens so quickly that you barely have time to think about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I... don't think this is right.\" You gasp breathlessly.  Matt continues to undress while kissing your lips, neck and eventually your breasts.  When he licks and sucks your nipples you let out a loud gasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckles, \"I knew that would get you.\"  You want to be mad but the passion in your body is too intense and you just grab his head and pull it into your boobs.  He removes your panties and his boxers.  Matt's cock is hard and ready.  He pushes you back onto the bed.  Before you can protest, he kisses you, parting your legs with his knees and presses the tip of his cock against your pussy.  Your pussy is on fire, you want to scream at him to fuck you.  But you also want to scream at him to stop.  As you fight against yourself you feel Matt push into you and the internal argument is over.  It's as if Amber's body takes over and you feel your legs wrap around him.  Your arms pull on his ass cheeks to pull him in deeper.  Matt shoves into you and pulls out.  Then he slams into you again.  With each thrust you can feel your breasts jiggle.  All of these sensations send you over the edge.  You hear a scream come from your mouth as you cum.  If feels like your whole body is orgasming.  Then you hear Matt grunt.  He stiffens up and you can feel his big throbbing cock deep in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there panting with Matt's much larger body laying on top of you.  At first you just enjoy the after-glow.  But then you return to your senses and feel embarrassed.  Not only did you have sex with a man, but it's your best friend.  And to make it worse, you completely enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighs, his softening cock slips out of your tender pussy.  \"That was amazing.  Better than ever.  Amber never fucked like that.\"  A part of you is repulsed, another part is flattered.  But now what?</span></div></div>",

I packed some of your... um... Amber's swimsuits if you want to go change.  I'll look for beaches that I'd hate but she would have loved.\" He gets up and picks up a brochure about Hawaii.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are ready to get up, you see Matt's butt.  His firm, sexy, naked butt.  A shudder runs through your body and you jump out of bed and grab your bag as you head to the bathroom.  You mutter that you need to get out of this body and can hear Matt chuck.  You flash a glare at him but his back is still turned to you and you get a rush through your body as you see his naked butt again.  You slam the bathroom door in frustration and reach into the bag to find a couple of bikinis and wraps.  \"Couldn't you have packed a decent swimsuit?\" You call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt calls back, \"I'm sorry, it's all she had.  I did throw in some stuff to cover up with and sandals though.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble as you look at the bikinis and find the ones that will cover up the most skin.  One is a light blue halter top and bikini bottom, the other is a leopard print with two straps on the top that seems to cover a bit more but the bottoms are tied on the side.  \"I just can't win.\" You sigh.  Both have a matching cover up but when you hold them up you realize it doesn't really cover up much.  Each one will barely cover your ass and are pretty much see-through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select a bikini and start to put it on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since the leopard print bikini seems like it will cover more of your large boobs, you decide to go with that.  You are surprised at how easily you are able to put it on.  Almost like Amber's body is doing it from muscle memory or something.  You run a quick brush through your hair and put it up into a ponytail to keep it out of the way.  The bag has some sandals that look comfortable as well as some stylish sunglasses.  You put both on and then put on the wrap and come out.  Matt is already in a swim suit and a button up beach shirt.  He looks up and you can tell he likes what he sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meow! Feeling a little wild?\" He teases.  Your cheeks burn and you glare at him.  As you turn to go back in the bathroom to change into something else, he grabs your arm.  \"No wait, I'm just teasing.  C'mon, you used to be better at taking a joke when you were a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you want to get mad at him, but then you'd just prove his point so you take a deep breath and decide to live with the bikini and wrap you have on.  \"I can still take a joke, but no more jokes about me enjoying this or intentionally trying to look good.\"  He grins and nods, then opens the door for you and the two of you go to the elevator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the lobby, you see several men turn and look at you.  You can't help but feel flattered.  Matt's arm goes around your waist and he pulls you in close.  Angry, but not wanting to make a scene, you whisper, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt whispers in your ear, \"We're supposed to be married and we should act like it or people will wonder if something is wrong.  Besides, look at how these guys are checking you out.  If any of them thought you were even partially available, you'd be getting hit on the whole time we're here.  I'm just protecting you.  Now giggle like I'm flirting or teasing you.\"  He moves away from your ear.  You let out a little giggle that you think would sound cute if you were a guy and feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk toward the beach, you realize that you are really grateful to Matt for protecting you like this.  He's been nothing but nice to you since this all started.  Sure, there's been the comments, but they were really just playful jokes.  Well, and the sex... You feel a tingle between your legs when you think about the sex and how amazing it felt.  Maybe you'd let him do that again before finding Amber.  What would it feel like to be in different positions?  Your mind continues to wander down this path before you realize it.  You are partway through wondering what oral sex would be like when Matt asks you a question.  Startled, you look at him.  \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just asked if you wanted a drink before we find a spot on the beach.  Hey, are you okay? You look a bit flushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you snap, \"I'm fine.  Just get me that damned drink.\"  You hope he'll leave it at that.  After all, how do you tell your best friend you were just thinking about having sex with him again, not to mention going down on him.  He turns to order a drink at a cabana bar.  Taking a deep breath, you try to think of things to shut down the libido in Amber's body.  By the time Matt returns with a fruity rum drink, that you have never liked as a guy, you manage to push back the thoughts a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to the beach!\"  Matt announces with a smile.  The smile brings back a few tingles but he doesn't seem to notice.  The two of you find a nice empty spot and you lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need me to put sunscreen on your back?\" Matt asks.  You are sure he's being an ass again and sit up with the intent of giving him a piece of your mind.  But he looks sincere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million thoughts run through your mind.  You feel the need to talk things out with him.  You want him to know how you feel and what you are going through.  But you know that is probably just your female brain working.  You are supposed to be a guy.  Guys don't talk about their feelings.  It feels like you are about to cry.  Silently cursing your stupid hormones, you reply to Matt,</span></div></div>",

You expected to smell something like coconut but this has a different aroma.  It is a pleasant, intoxicating smell that makes you relax.  Matt's hands slowly work up your back and you feel yourself drifting off.  As his hands reach your shoulders, you are thinking or dreaming (it's hard to tell which) about your earlier sexual experience.  You can almost feel Matt pushing into you.  For a second, you wonder if you've moaned out loud but since Matt doesn't say anything, you continue to drift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a little sigh and slip into a light slumber.  You can feel Matt finishing up your shoulders and neck, then he starts on your ankles and, alternating legs, works up your calves.  By the time he has reached your thighs, you are dreaming about Matt's cock and what it might taste like.  You dream of being like this for the rest of your life and a voice that sounds like Matt's whispers in your ear.  You can't quite make it out but you get the feeling about how nice it is to be protected by him and how wonderful you felt in pleasing him earlier.  This last thought scares you and your eyes pop open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt is finishing up your thighs and pulls his hands away as you sit up quickly.  Looking at him, all the half dream thoughts flood back.  You are angry and horny and nervous and scared all at once.  Trying to pick one emotion, you tell Matt, </span></div></div>",

They take the precaution of tying Amber up to a chair before beginning the spell. Meanwhile you and Matt have passed out. While asleep the spell takes effect. Matt's soul flies across the few blocks between your homes as Amber's flies towards your's. Amber's soul enters Matt's body and takes control. To bad she didn't count on the fact that he'd been drinking. \"Oh crap\", he awakes with a start and then promptly throws up all over your livingroom. You awake to that and look over and not knowing that this is now Amber say, \"Dude, you couldn't make it to the bathroom\"? He gives you a look and says, \"You ass, you had to get him drunk\". Not all the awake or sober you ask confused, \"What are you talking about, Matt\"? He stumbles getting up and says, \"You two assholes deserve each other\". He then grabs his keys and stumbles out the door. You try to figure out what the hell he was talking about for about a minute before figuring he was just drunk and talking crazy. You pass back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back at Matt's house Matt awake in Amber's very sober, but tied up body. She looks down at her tits and screams, \"What the fuck\"?

The chair is sitting in the middle of a pentagram that has been painted on the floor in blood. \"What the fuck is going on\", Matt screams. Erica smiles and says, \"Amber wanted me to leave you this. It will explain everything. You should be able to untie yourself in a few hours\". She then throws a letter on Matt's lap. \"Hope you enjoy your new life\", she says with a smile. Erica then gives Matt a kiss and says, \"Goodbye\". She then leaves.</span></div></div>",

You look around, but don't find him anywhere. \"Shit, I hope he made it home ok\", you mumble to yourself. You try calling his cell and house phone, but don't get an answer. You shake your head and start brewing some coffee. After a couple of cups you try calling again, but still don't get an answer. You tell yourself he's probably just passed out at his house, but it doesn't ease your concerns. In addition to being very drunk last night he was very depressed about Amber leaving. You hope he didn't do anything crazy. \"Fuck\", you say out loud and grab your keys. You head over to Matt's house keeping an eye out along the way just in case he's in a ditch somewhere. You feel a little relieved when you get to his house and see his car parked up in the lawn. You sit in the driveway for a few minutes before deciding to go in and check on him. \"At least Amber's car is gone\", you think while getting out of your car. Amber is hot as hell and if she wasn't Matt's wife and a total bitch you'd love to do her. You find Matt's door unlocked though it wouldn't have mattered, you have a key. You step inside and yell, \"Matt, it's me Aaron. Are you here\"? You stand there for only a second before hearing what sounds like Amber's muffled scream that sounds like it's saying, \"In here, I need help\". You rush downstairs to the basement where the shout came from and find Amber tied up on the floor next to a chair. She naked with a gag over her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.jemtube.com/inxy/m/000/325/840/t429416xc71753.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.jemtube.com/inxy/m/000/325/84...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, Matt, what did you do\", you mumble. You walk over and remove the gag from her mouth admiring her body as you do. \"Oh think gawd it's you Aaron. Get me untied, we need to go after her\", she shouts. You work on getting her untied and ask, \"Did Matt do this to you\"? She looks at you, takes a breath, and says, \"I am Matt. Some how Amber's bitch girlfriend switched our bodies\". You pause untying her for a second and just stare at her. \"What\", you finaly manage to say? She shakes her head and says, \"Just untie me, ok. I'll explain the rest afterwards\". You finish untying her and she wraps herself in a blanket. She then goes on to explain that she is really Matt and Amber's girlfriend is a witch that switched her and Amber's bodies. Any other time you would think that this was one of Matt's sick twisted jokes, but between all the candles in the room, the pentagram on the floor, and Matt's wierd behaviour last night you start believing it. That and Amber would never go along with a joke that involved you seeing her naked. You finaly say, \"Ok, saying this is all true. What do we do\"? Matt shrugs and says, \"We go after her. She's going to marry her witch girlfriend as me. I signed the divorce papers yesterday before going to your house. I thought it was wierd that she was letting me keep everything. She didn't want anything except to be away from me. I thought it was weird at the time, but went with it. Now it makes sense. She was planning this all along. Now she has everything\". \"Ok, but how does that help us find her, well you, her in your body\", you ask? She sighs and says, \"Amber always wanted a wedding in..............</span></div></div>",

As she disappears and try to soak in everything that just happened. You still don't know if you believe any of this, but the real Amber wouldn't carry a joke this far. That leaves two possibilities. The first is that everything that she just said is the truth. She's really Matt somehow in Amber's body. With the real Amber in Matt's body heading for Vagas with a witch girlfriend to get married. The second is that Amber has had a complete mental breakdown. In which case Matt is still missing and she may have had something to do with it. If that's the case for some reason she wants to run off to Vagas with you for some reason. Only one thing comes to mind after seeing her naked on the floor.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erica was sitting in the lobby of the hotel, waiting for Amber. She\u2019d been waiting for the last hour and she was getting worried. The hotel was actually closer to David\u2019s house than it is to Matt\u2019s, so by rights Amber should have arrived first, if only by a few minutes. That she didn\u2019t was worrying, and as the minutes passed Erica got more and more worried. She couldn\u2019t imagine what could possibly have gone wrong. The spell had worked perfectly. Unless, maybe they had gotten something wrong and Amber had been swapped with someone else maybe. But that couldn\u2019t have happened. Something of the head, something of the bed, something of the sex, and something of the thread. There were at least 4 different personal items needed from each body for the transfer to happen.  Hair from his comb, a piece from his pillow, pubic hairs pulled from a pair of recently worn boxers, and a small piece of those same boxers, all collected this afternoon. There was no way for the spell to go so wrong that Amber would have transferred anywhere but to Matt\u2019s body, so of course the spell had worked perfectly. At least it appeared to have. Erica had just assumed the confused person in Amber\u2019s body was Matt. Now she regretted not actually taking the time to confirm that it was. But it couldn\u2019t have been anyone else, could it?<br>\r\n  These thoughts tumbled over and over as she sat in the lobby, anxiously watching the door.<br>\r\n  She\u2019d dialed Matt\u2019s cell phone several times, but each time it just rang until it went to voice mail. Of course that didn\u2019t mean anything. Knowing Matt he had probably password protected the phone, which meant that Amber couldn\u2019t answer without knowing the code. Too bad he didn\u2019t have one of the latest biometric phone which would have read the fingerprint and let the phone be answered no matter who was in control of the body. <br>\r\n  Finally she could take waiting no more. She would drive over to David\u2019s and see if there were any clues to what was going on. Maybe Amber needed help or something.<br>\r\n  After leaving word at the desk, just in case, she got behind the wheel of the beat up Chrysler Neon she drove (one of the first things she planned to replace, once she and Amber got their hands on Matt\u2019s money) and began the task of coaxing the balky engine to start. One thing a witch couldn\u2019t do was auto repairs. Their powers worked only on things that were organic in nature, living or once living things. Such was her haste that she didn\u2019t wait until the engine had completely warmed up; instead she pulled the car out of the lot practically as soon as she got the door closed. Fortunately, the stuttering engine refused to stall, and by the time she had reached the freeway that was the quickest route to David\u2019s house, the engine was running as smoothly as it ever did.<br>\r\n  As soon as she hit the freeway traffic slowed to a crawl, adding to her frustration and anxiety. It was a full twenty minutes of idling along until the line of cars inched their way down the half mile or so to where she could see the police lights, and another twenty before she passed the overpass that blocked much of the accident scene from view. All the while she cursed whoever it was that designed freeways so that there was no way off them in these situations. Once you see there is a traffic jam it was too late and you were already stuck in it. <br>\r\n  By the time she came abreast of the accident scene most of the wreckage had been cleared away. All that remained were a few fire trucks and a flat bed tow truck. One of the vehicles involved was just being loaded onto the truck as she passed. By chance she glanced at the wreck just in time to see the tarp covering it flap aside, exposing the license plate. It took a few seconds for her brain to process what she\u2019d seen, and then she slammed on her brakes, earning the ire of the cars following her that had to do the same to avoid hitting her. Headless of the horns blaring around her she jumped out of the car and ran towards the wreck. Strong arms stopped her before she reached the scene; she struggled a bit, and then collapsed to her knees, sobbing, as the tow driver refastened the tarp, covering the vanity license plate from view. A plate that belonged to a car that she\u2019d seen to many times parked in Amber\u2019s driveway. A plate she knew by heart. Matt-Man. A plate that was on the car Amber would have been driving on her way to the hotel.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Darkness starts creeping in from the corners of your vision. Suddenly the floors comes up and meets your face. You don't feel it though as your whole body has become numb. \"Oh crap, I'm dying\", you think as the last bits of consciousness fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't die though, but you also don't dream. You awake to sunshine shining through your bedroom window. You feel as if you've been run over by a truck. Your vision is taking a long time to adjust to the sunlight. Your lips feel very swollen. You raise your hand to feel them only to have it stopped by two fleshy obstructions on your chest. Your eyes start to focus and you look down. They're not on your chest, but is your chest. You stare in disbelief. Your eyes tell you that what your looking at is a pair of large female breasts with pert female nipples on top of them. Your mind tells you this is impossible because you're a man. You give them a squeeze and defiantly feel real enough. Them nipples are sensitive and react to your touch. You move your hand up and feel your full lips. Your goatee is gone and there is not a trace of stubble. You then feel that not only has you receding hairline is gone, but you now a have a full head of long hair draped over your shoulders. Fear begins to fill you as your mind starts catching up with your senses. You reach you hand down between your legs already suspecting what you won't find there. Your fingers confirm your fears when instead of you rather modest manhood you find a vulva. Your finger slides into your vagina and finds your clit confirming you're a woman. You jerk your hand away and attempt to get out of bed. You do more of a roll and nearly fall down. You whole center of gravity is off. You walk over to your mirror on legs that are shaking and look in. You see a woman looking back at you. A rather busty and beautiful woman, but this woman has your eyes. You can see you features in hers though feminized greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Is this what you see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.sex.com/images/pinporn/2013/09/09/620/3617159-blonde-big-boobs-nude-teen-daily.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.sex.com/images/pinporn/201...</a></span></div></div>",

It was a creepy job for a government contractor. There was armed guards and security out the ass there. It didn't take you long to figure out they were working on some real black shit. \"Fuck, this is real! Give me the antidote\", you shout! Matt slumps and says, \"There is no antidote, or I didn't ever hear them talking about one.\" This information hits you like a train.

That was why she left them here.\" You look at them again and realize he's right. \"Fuck me\", you mutter. \"I'll leave you to get dressed\", Matt say and leaves the bedroom. You hold up the bra and state, \"You've got to be kidding me.\" It takes you a while to get dressed. You have plenty of experience removing a woman's clothes, but none with putting them on. You check yourself in the mirror. The clothes look like they fit right, but they feel weird. What's worse is the girl in the mirror wears them better than Jessica did. If you still had a dick you'd be giving yourself a hard-on. You have this extra flesh that seems to jiggle in the most annoyingly sexy way. You skip the heels Matt brought in with the clothes.

You say check yourself out, but the woman in the mirror feels like a stranger. The nighty is nearly see through and you can see her nipples, which are hard with arousal. Her breasts are barely contained. You didn't bother with the matching panties and can see her nicely shaved pussy. You spin to check out the ass. \"Shit\", you exclaim. The geeks who brewed up this were good. You're getting really hot and out of reflex reach for your cock. Your fingers instead find a pussy, your pussy. \"Oh damn\", you moan your knees buckling. You pull the nighty up to get a better look at your new anatomy. It felt good, real good when your fingers brushed against it. You feel compelled to touch it more, but wonder what that would say about your masculinity.    </span></div></div>",

You fingered plenty of pussies and fondled just as many tits, but it never felt like this. You've also already had a very stressful day. You know from past experience that the best cure for stress is sex. The confusing part is that the kind of release that the body you currently have is not the kind of release you're accustomed to. You want to fuck the girl in the mirror and the girl in the mirror very much wants to be fucked, at least her body does. The problem is that you're the girl in the mirror. \"What the fuck\", you mutter. You slide one hand between your legs and another to your chest. \"Fuck yes\", you moan in pleasure. The sensations aren't like anything you've ever experienced. For a brief second you wonder if it always feels this good for omen, or if it feels this good because it's new to you. You quickly find your clit, something that has been somewhat of a challenge in the past. \"Oh fuck\", you scream experiencing a small orgasm, though to you it doesn't feel small. You need more, you want to feel more. You want to feel something deep inside your new anatomy. You remember something else you bought for Jessica that she never used. You retrieve the 12\" dildo still in the box from where it was still stored beside the bed. You wanted to watch Jessica masturbate with it, but she wasn't game. You fumble with the switch turning it on. You watch in the mirror as you try to navigate it into your slit. You hands shake with anticipation. \"Yes, yes\", you moan as you plunge it deeper and deeper into your cunt. \"Fuck that shit, babe\", you moan. The sound of your sexy voice causes you to get even hotter. Your male mind imagines fucking the girl in the mirror while your female body feels the sensations of being fucked. The story in your mind begins getting muddled as another orgasms begins to build. You feel this thing invading your body and it feels good. For a second you wonder what it would be like to have a real hard, hot, throbbing man cock inside you. It's all it takes to drive you over the edge. \"Oh fuck\", you stammer as you're racked by the most intense orgasm of your life. Your legs clench around the artificial penis imbedded in your pussy. \"Oh shit, oh shit\", you pant as another orgasm suddenly follows the first. It seems like forever for your orgasm to finish. You're left lying back on the bed trying to catch your breath. You lay there reflecting on what just happened. What set of the best orgasm you've ever had was brought on by imagining that you had a real cock inside you.</span></div></div>",

You'd guess you're hitting the double d mark now if not bigger. You have no idea how the sizes work. You only know, or rather knew you liked big boobs. Now that you have a pair of your own your opinion is starting to change. You can't help but feel that this is somehow the universe paying you back, not in a good way. You seem to be becoming everything you ever wanted in a woman. \"This is fucking crazy\", you mutter annoyed at the lack of clothing to wear. If this is permanent and from what Matt said it is. Unless you want to take the chance of hacking into top secret government computers of a black-op group and hope you find something useful. The chances are slim though. You and Matt are programmers not scientist. You're not going to be able to whip up a fix in your garage. Your mind may still be trying to wrap itself around your new reality, but one thing is for certain is that you're going to need clothes that fit and are more appropriate. That of course means going out shopping. You sort through and find a halter top you bought Jessica before checking her sizes. It was to big for her, but maybe. You try it on and find that it does fit. It shows a lot of cleavage, but you can't see your nipples. Well, they're still erect. You finish getting dressed after finding a pair of shorts. Funny, Matt couldn't find them this morning, but could find a mini skirt that barely covered your ass. The shorts are so tight that you wonder for a second if the skirt would have been better. You take a look in the mirror and gasp. Even without makeup you're one hot chick. You imagine going out in public looking like this and start getting panicked. People will be looking, guys will be looking and you know what will be going through their minds. Shit, it's going through your mind and thanks to the incident earlier the seed has been planted in your mind about what it may feel like. That seed sprouts and you start feeling aroused. This alarms you even more. \"I'm a man, I'm a man\", you say out loud. A look back into the mirror renders that statement as false. You're not a man anymore and may never be one again. </span></div></div>",

You glance over in a mirror and think, \"What would I like to see this woman wearing?\" Nothing comes to mind before more reasonable ideas come to mind. You attempt to push the thoughts of sex out of your mind and concentrate on what you found attractive on woman when you were just going out with them.

Not only are bra sizes seem dependent on style, but so does most women's clothes for that matter. \"Your size should be your size\", you grumble out loud. The clerk laughs and agrees with you, but offers no explanation for this obvious attempt by manufacturers to confuse people. You don't feel so bad about getting past girlfriends sizes wrong when you bought them something. She does confirm you're a big girl up top. She also comments they are very perky and firm for their size. You didn't think women really noticed or compared boobs as they always seemed to make fun of men when they compared dick size.

You're beginning to understand why they spend so much time shopping and why most department stores have such large women clothing departments. You originally were looking for something modest, but manufactures must have assumed that women that possess your figure would want to show it off.

You remember lessons on hormones and pheromones. You wonder if you're experiencing a natural biological reaction? It's only strange because you have no experience with it. </span></div></div>",

Truthfully you weren't even sure why you bought the dress, you had certainly gone into the shopping trip intent on not buying anything too feminine. You snorted a laugh at that thought as you looked down after taking the shorts and shirt off. Standing in your bra and panties in your pornstar shaped body, your hopes to not appear feminine appeared quite moot. The saleslady had convinced you how hot you'd look in this dress, and now you were glad you got it, that and the other thing you swore you wouldn't buy. It was admittedly exciting that Matt wanted to see you wearing it and your body desired to be admired by a man. \"Especially by a hot one,\" you thought, quickly chasing that away. \"Just put on the stupid dress.\" You slipped it over your head and pulled it down, stretching it over your wide hips. Adjusting your breasts so that they were on full display, you remembered the belt that the lady told you would look perfect with it. Completing the ensemble, you stepped out to a slack jawed Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.......You look...incredible.\" The words worked well on your body, feeling the tingling sensation again. You walked over to Matt, only realizing when you got to him that you were putting an exaggerated sway in your hips. Picking his jaw off the floor, as well as the other item, or items, you swore not to buy, Matt said, \"Only missing one thing.\" You knew what Matt was doing, but you also didn't want to stop yourself as you grabbed the heeled boots and put them on. Deciding the model the full outfit out, you did a few paces around the room, giving several views of your backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/kQMaJot.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/kQMaJot.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fun as this was, this was a long day, I think I'm going to take a shower. You can hang out if you want.\" You sauntered over to the bathroom and closed the door, quickly stripping and getting into the shower. Your body was on fire at this point and a cold shower was exactly what you needed to clear you head.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You walk into the bathroom and close the door, not even worrying about hearing the click to make sure it was closed. You head over to the mirror and see what you did to yourself, standing there in the short, tight dress that showed off lots of leg and cleavage, you cleavage. <br>\r\n\"Girl, what were you thinking?\" you thought, so deep in thought that you didn't even catch that first part. A few days ago you were a perfectly straight male, not at all interested in anything more from Matt then a drinking buddy, and now you were a sexy bombshell of a woman, showing off her new dress and heels, and hoping he liked what he saw. There was no denying it now, this body was demanding male attention, and no matter how hard you fought it, it was starting to affect you mentally to where you were willingly showcasing your femininity. All of these thoughts converged on one part of your body getting increasingly hot, the part between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cold shower, that's what I need right now.\" you said to yourself, getting undressed and turning the water on before stepping into the shower and closing the door. You let out a small, girlish shriek as the cold water hit your sensitive skin, and as much as you thought you needed it, your body demanded warmer water before you turned on the heat. As you lathered up, you couldn't help but wonder what else you did as a guy that would help alleviate these feeling, and as you rubbed your generous breasts, the shock across your body gave you an idea. Slowly you drifted your hand down and began rubbing at your new pussy. The feeling were unlike anything you would have thought and almost instantly you let out a small whimper of pleasure. This was nice, but something in your mind said you need a bit more, deciding to plunge a finger inside and revel in the feeling closing your eyes to the feelings. You wanted to continue your ministrations, but as you prepared to push a second finger inside, you heard the unmistakable sound of the shower door opening and closing, as well as the presence of another larger person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, what are you doing?\" You asked, turning around to see that he had joined you in the shower, fully naked and with a grin on his face that said he had been joining your display of self-pleasure. \"What do you mean? He asked, still grinning, \"I've been with enough women to know an invitation when I see it. You've been stealing glances at me all day, and your display with the dress worked wonders on me. I thought you had just been messing with my head, but then you left the bathroom door open, so I let myself in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt, that's not what I.....\" You wanted to tell him off but as you started speaking, you couldn't help but stare, stare at your friend's body. As you took it in, the hot, tingling feeling returned and your gaze stopped when you got to his penis. A sight that used to disgust you was now fascinating you. Matt got the message and lifted your chin up before planting a kiss on your lips. As your tongue wrested with his, he pulled you into a tight embrace that brought your sexes dangerously close. Matt broke the and chuckled, \"Glad to see I was right,\" You saw he was glancing down and you realized that, without even noticing what you were doing or when, you were now stroking his manhood slowly. Matt began kissing down your neck as he spun you around, while playing with your nipples. Feelings you didn't even know were possible were overloading your brain. On instinct, you began to raise your hips into Matt, giving him a prominent view of your pussy from behind. The incredible feelings of pleasure firing off in your brain made you wonder why didn't you give into this body sooner. One of Matt's hands left your breasts, and you knew exactly what he was doing with it, as he slightly backed up and shifted position behind you. You never would have guessed that your first time as a woman would be doggy style, and the increasingly tiny male of your brain is screaming no, but the larger and louder female part is screaming yes, causing to bend over further. \"What are you waiting for? Do it!\" You said, giving Matt the satisfaction of making you ask for it. He positioned his cock at your pussy and plunged in, going slowly to maximize the pleasure torture you were experiencing. He pulled out slowly, too slowly, as you attempted to back up and take it back in but were held in place by your hips. Matt finally sank himself deep, and found a rhythm. As he continued to pound you into sexual bliss, you grabbed what you could to keep from collapsing and continue to ride this out. Everything, from the pleasure assault on your pussy, to the swinging of your large breasts, to the ripples throughout your body caused by the greatest sexual experience you ever encountered caused you to scream out in pleasure. \"Oh my god! Harder. Fuck me harder!\" Matt obliged picking up the pace until you felt something unlike any orgasm you ever felt. It exploded from your pussy and spread outward through your entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gfycat.com/LividExemplaryIndochinahogdeer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gfycat.com/LividExemplaryIndochi...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to moan as your pussy contracted around Matts cock until you felt him slow down and stiffen inside you. As he pulsed, you felt another heat within you and you knew he came, which aroused you even further, if possible. Still in the euphoria of post sex pleasure, you gripped the wall to brace yourself as your stood up to face Matt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt....\"</span></div></div>",

I can't do this, you need to leave, now!\" <br>\r\n\"What?\" Matt seemed genuinely confused, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\nClear head again, you regained control of your mind and felt the anger swell, \"I can't believe you came in here and did this!\"<br>\r\nAnger started to appear on Matt's face, \"I'm sorry, I must have misheard you begging me to fuck you harder while you moaned in pleasure.\"<br>\r\n\"It's these damn hormones, you know that! I was a man yesterday for god's sake. Just go, I can't deal with this right now. Please.\" Matt wordlessly got out of of the shower and the bathroom, leaving you there alone. You sat down while the water continued to run while you waited for the sound of the front door to let you know Matt left, trying not to think about what just happened or the feeling of the Matt's cock between your legs. Once you were sure that he was gone, you stood up and turned the water off. Through the process of drying off, you realized why women invested in hairdryers, using a couple of towels to dry off the mane of hair you now possessed, finally giving up when you realized you got it as dry as you were going to get it this way. It was only now you realized how tired you were, and that you hadn't bought anything to wear for bed. Determined to reassert your masculinity, as much as you could with a female porn star shaped body anyways, you went to your room to grab your usual boxers and old band tshirt that you normally wore to bed. After putting them on, you looked in the mirror and could only laugh at how ridiculous you looked. The shirt wasn't too bad, a bit tight in your generous chest but luckily your shirt was large enough to accommodate your bust without looking too large on you. The boxers were another matter, the waist was far too large and the legs too small for your own narrow waist and thick tights. The material felt rough on your sensitive skin and all of this just felt...wrong...for lack of a better word, creating an uneasy feeling that you couldn't explain. You sighed as you took them off and reached into your shopping bag for the panties you had picked up. Fortunately the sales lady was helpful in grabbing several pairs for you. Unfortunately you didn't really examine them, only making sure you didn't get any colors that weren't \"too girly\", and ended up with thongs and high cut styles that barely covered more. You chose a lacy black pair and felt the unease in your mind settle as your slid them on, surprised at how comfortable they actually felt, for as little as they covered. You couldn't help but smile at the woman in the mirror facing you, the woman you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6WO8T.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/6WO8T.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smiled faded with a yawn, and you made your way to bed. You started feeling bad for how you yelled at Matt, but you couldn't dwell on that for long. You'd apologize to him in the morning....or.......as a another thought entered your mind suddenly, pushing aside the others, maybe you'll get some more shopping done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were at a bar, staring at yourself in the mirror that covered the wall while you waited for your drink. The woman, you, was stunning. Her face was perfectly made up, hair styled with soft waves and framing your face perfectly. Looking down you saw you were wearing a gorgeous red dress held up by thin straps on your shoulders, leading to a low cut that prominently showed off your generous bust to the world. It was tight on your hips and highlighted your ass perfectly. It flowed loosely to the floor and had a long slit on one side to show off your long and shapely leg. You took extreme pride in how feminine and sexy you looked and felt. A man whose face you couldn't make out came with your drink, as he complimented how sexy you looked. Your dream shifted as you grabbed his hand, leading him away and swinging your hips so he could admire the view. Next thing you knew, you were in a room, on your back in bed, with your legs spread and in the air. Your lover was between your legs pounding your pussy to bliss. As you focused on the pleasure between your legs, and on your chest, you moaned in delight. When he pulled out, you leapt at him and grabbed his cock with your well manicured hand, pulling him closer to your face as you opened your mouth wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly jolted yourself awake before you went too far, the heat between your legs still prevalent as you realized that you had one hand in your panties, rubbing your pussy in time with the dream. The other hand had pulled your shirt up, and was playing with a breast. The sexual nature of the dream was both unnerving and exciting at the same time, the conflicts arising from how easily your subconscious seemed to adapt to the female role. Was this a side effect of the transformation? You made your way to the bathroom and were shocked by your appearance. Your hair, clearly suffering from the lack of drying and sleeping right after refusing to wait for it to dry naturally, was a tangled mess, and you had no idea what to do with it. As you grabbed a comb, you grimaced in pain when you hit tangle after tangle. That uneasy feeling from last night came back as you realized that you couldn't get this under control on your own, and how your face could really do with some make-up. You gave up as you decided to get dressed and figure out what to do with yourself, grabbing the bags from yesterday off the floor. Today you had decided on a pair of silk blue panties, forgoing the thongs and settling on a comfortable pair that still exposed a bit of your perfect ass. You made sure to find the matching bra, struggling a bit as your hooked it and settled your breasts inside. Jeans took a few minutes to get up your hips, the skintight feeling exciting you a bit. A simple black shirt completed the outfit, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your phone and saw you had a couple of voicemails from Matt. You were about to listen to them when you thought about your appearance. It may have been just Matt, but you really couldn't go see him and apologize for your behavior looking at like this, could you?</span></div></div>",

What you needed to address right now was your appearance, or people would assume that something was wrong with you. You grabbed your credit cards, realizing that you would either need to lie that you had your husband's cards or get cash on the way, deciding on the latter. Returning to the mall seemed like the best option so you found yourself back there and entering one of the salons you were so used to ignoring prior. Luckily, since this was a weekday, it wasn't as busy as you expected. The girl at the front smiled as she greeted you, \"Hi there! Do you have an appointment?\" Frowning you said, \"Sorry, but no. I'm hoping you can get me in without one. As you can see, I really need help here.\" The girl giggled and said, \"That's okay, we actually had a couple of cancellations, so we can get you in in a few minutes. What's your name?\" \"My name is Aar-, Allie.\" You nearly said your old name and used the first name that came to your head. The girl seemingly didn't notice your slip up and said, \"Thanks Ally, it will be just a bit.\" You thanked her and sat down, checked your phone for a moment. You had a new voicemail from Matt, with a text from him as well that said, \"Call me ASAP!\" Again, you decided that his apology could said, let him stew in his guilt a bit longer. Luckily you only had to wait a bit longer before you heard, \"Allie? We're ready for you.\" You got up and sat down at the chair the stylist motioned for you. She wrapped a smock around your and asked, \"Okay sweetie, what are we doing for you today.\" You gave your best exasperated look as you said, \"Just about everything. My house was robbed and I lost quite a bit. Clearly all my make-up and hair care equipment are gone down. This look works for appearing stressed out, but I need to feel better now.\" The stylist laughed and replied, \"Don't you worry, we'll get you taken care of. If you like, we're running a special on manicure's and polish as well. Only $25 with the purchase of hair and facial service.\" You remembered how pretty your hands looked in the dream as your almost automatically replied, \"Why not? It's only money. I leave myself in your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stylist went to work giving your hair a light cut, shampoo, blow dry, and styling. Your face received a variety of lotions and treatments before being given a light production of make-up which lighted all of your best features. Your nails were also filed and shaped to perfection and then painted with a bright red nail polish you picked out, inspired by your dress in the dream. All the while you sat, completely relaxed and absorbing everything she did to you, remembering everything to such a degree that you surprised yourself by how confident you were that you could replicate the beauty tricks being performed on you. When you were shown the end result some time later, you were both amazed and happy with the beauty that faced you. This was perfect. As you were checking out, you made sure to pick up all of the hair care products and equipment you would need to do this at hope. The girl at the desk told you about the sale you saw yesterday that you were unable to check out, and said that if you gave them a reference card from here, you could get more of a discount. You had not intended to get more clothing after yesterday, but you may be in this body for a while, and you certainly were not able to get enough to live as a woman for an extended time, plus you also realized that you did not have anything for the hot weather right now, \"When in Rome....\" you thought as you paid and made your way to the department store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Many hours later, you walked back into your house, holding numerous bags from stores, having left more behind in your car. You quickly walked back to your bedroom and threw them on your bed and saw yourself in the full length mirror on your closet door. \"What happened today?\" You asked, looking at yourself. When you left today, you were unkempt, wearing jeans and a normal black shirt, when you came back however, you looked very different. After getting far more done in beauty care then you ever intended, you went into a clothing store and for lack of a better term, went crazy. You even wore something you bought out of the store and now found yourself wearing a short white pleated skirt, hot pink spaghetti strap blouse, and 2 inch cork heeled sandals. It had made so much sense in the store to change. You reasoned that it was so hot outside, jeans didn't make sense to wear, and the skirt was very breathable. The black contrasted too much, the pink blouse went so much better with the skirt. And of course, you needed a casual heeled sandal to wear with the skirt, or it would look wear. All of this screamed femininity, and the scariest part was how right all of this felt. You would have thought you would resist this, but it was far more difficult to resist acting as girly as you felt. It was more hard to resist putting on one of the sundresses you picked up than refusing this ensemble in favor of your plain outfit earlier. The panicked feeling you had quickly subsided the longer you looked in the mirror, \"Don't be silly!\" you thought, \"Why should women's clothes feel wrong, I can't fit in men's clothes after all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heels clicked as you retrieved the rest of the items out of your car, putting them on the bed and getting to work moving your purchases to your dresser and closet and moving your male clothes into bags for later. All in all, you found yourself fully prepared for many days after having bought 12 dresses (for casual and going out), 8 skirts, 15 blouses, a couple of pairs of yoga pants, 3 bikinis, several leggings, a few nighties and sleepshirts (the regular shirt had just not felt comfortable). Your lingerie selection was now significantly expanded. You had no intention of buying more, but as your clothes selection expanded, you felt like you had no choice but to get more. Originally you only had the blue set, and a couple of black and white sets, but now you had panties of every color you could think of, every cut they had, and of course bras to match (you always liked when other women matched their bras to their underwear). You had especially liked how you looked in both purple and pink lingerie, so you made sure to pick up a few matching bra and panty sets in both colors. You also were enticed by the saleslady to buy some items that you never would have thought of. And the shoes, \"OMG the shoes\" you found yourself thinking. Where you entered the day with only a pair of sandals and one pair of heels from yesterday, now you had a pair of heels for every outfit you bought, in a variety of sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting up all of your new clothing, you looked at the clock, 8:30. \"Hmm, I could use a drink right now.\" You thought, also considering that you could show off one of your new dresses. \"I could use a confidence boost, I do look spectacular in them. Could be fun to make some shrewds jealous.\" But you still needed to call Matt back. What should you do? </span></div></div>",

You found a place at the bar top, enjoying how you noticed that every head, male and female, seemed to follow you. You were barely into your first glass of red wine when a beautiful blonde woman in a blue dress sat next to you. You smiled as you could not help but think that this is exactly the type of woman you would try to take home before. You struck up a conversation with her, attempting to flirt. She seemed to be interested a bit, but as the conversation continued, you couldn't help but notice that you were not at all aroused in her, as much as you tried to think about it. As the conversation started to go no further, she took her leave, looking somewhat disappointed. You watched her for a moment before getting distracted by something else, or rather, someone else. The guy you locked eyes with in that moment took the hint and walked over to the bar, offering to buy you another glass of wine. You accepted, never one to refuse a free drink and began talking with the stranger. He made small talk, inter cut with small jokes here and there that you found yourself laughing at. While he wasn't talking about anything particularly interesting, you found yourself listening intently, never looking away from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely noticed when a couple of hours had passed, all the while you were talking with this admittedly handsome stranger and enjoying a few more drinks, feeling quite tipsy as a result. As you lingered longer, you also noticed that you were feeling something else besides drunk. You were feeling hot, and after last night and this morning, you knew exactly what that feeling was. You placed your drink down, stood up, and got very close to the stranger whispering in his ear, \"I came here looking for a good fuck tonight. Think you can help out?\" He seemed almost shocked but nodded quickly enough as he paid out and escorted you out, with you wrapped around his arm. It admittedly felt wonderful to be pampered and protected like this, an idea that seemed so foreign before but now feels natural to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride back to his place was excruciating due to your arousal but thankfully short, and you pulled him in for a deep kiss as soon as you were in the door to his apartment. Your tongues wrestled and he wasted no time with his hands cupping your ass and pulling you right to him, allowing you to feel his hard on through his slacks and poking into your dress. You both barely broke the kiss to make your way to his couch. You pushed him down and straddled him as you unbuttoned his shirt. As you made your way down, he slipped his hand under your dress and began teasing your pussy through your panties, causing you to moan as his deftly pulled them off and placed a finger right at your lips. You attempted to continue your process but your arousal was too much, as you came around his fingers, moaning even louder. Not anywhere close to satisfied, you quickly reached for his pants, undoing them as fast as you could so you could get him inside you. Your date took your eagerness and proximity of your head the wrong way and began to push your shoulders down so that your face was level with his cock as soon as you freed it. Knowing what he wanted and feeling a bit disgusted at the thought, you decided that you too far too gone to care, and took it in your mouth as you shifted to your knees on the floor. Bobbing your head up and down, you hear him moan and began to pleasure yourself, as even this act was getting you hotter and hotter. You felt him stiffen and he held you in place before you could release him as he came in your mouth. You reluctantly swallowed it, now disappointed that you would have to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe, that was great. I haven't had head like that in a while. I'll be ready to go in a few if you're up for it. I know a few tricks that will drive you wild.\" Your disappointment in his performance so far was on your mind and now you kind of wanted to go and deal with Matt. On the other hand, he had piqued your interest and you were still extremely horny and ready for more </span></div></div>",

But something was nagging at you, \"Oh baby, that sounds sooo good, but I have to get going.\" You started gathering your things and noticed the disappointed look on the mans face as he starting straightening up. You sauntered over to him, \"I want you at your best stud, maybe next time I'll have a few tricks for you too,\" And in a move that surprised even yourself, you suddenly kissed this stranger long and deep, feeling him hard again through your dress. \"My name's Allison, and here's my number. You gave him your number and made your exit, calling a cab to take you home. The ride home was agonizing, as the heat between your legs was almost punishing you for not having sex with some stranger you picked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving home, you shucked off the dress and and your now soaked panties, replacing them with a new pair and one of the nighties you bought, enjoying the feel of the silk on your soft skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1.hoopchina.com.cn/u/1110/13/144/1144/f69014f4big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1.hoopchina.com.cn/u/1110/13/144...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter preparing for bed, you decided to finally call Matt back, expecting to hear his apology, thought now you really didn't seem to know what he should be sorry about. He picked up almost immediately, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron?! Aaron\" You almost didn't respond for a second, your male name just sounding odd now, \"Yes, hi Matt, you wanted to talk?\" You were trying to sound nonchalant. \"Thank god you called, I've been trying to get a hold of you, I was about to come over before it was too late.\" \"I was busy, what are you talking about?\" Matt starting speaking with a sense of desperation, \"After the other night, I couldn't stop thinking about it and how sorry I was, but also why you were acting weird at all. I wasn't going crazy, you were flirting with me throughout the day, and you never would have let it get as far as you did if you were still your old self, so I looked into what changed you and I found that after the physical change into a dream woman, the change starts affecting your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to feel scare now, and your thoughts felt as though they were coming up for air when you heard this, \"My mind? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"It's intended to turn you into the perfect woman, body and mind, as these scientists imagined, my guess is ultra feminine and sexually liberal. It would be subtle at first, making you open to more feminine behaviors, but eventually it would start to cause you discomfort if you didn't dress and act feminine and act on heterosexual female sexual desires. The goal is that you would then act on these behaviors automatically as though nothing was wrong.\" You were already feeling dread as you thought about his words, \"How long?\" Matt sighed, \"That's just it, it's supposed to take a week at least, but us having sex would have accelerated the mental conditioning. You accepting the female role in sex would have a snowball effect on it all.\" You were silent for a few seconds before responding, \"Wha-What can we do?\" Tears were welling up and you realized this was exactly what he was talking about. \"We'll go to the lab tomorrow, I told them there was an accidental exposure and they said they could treat you if it wasn't too late. I know how much trouble we could have gotten in but I couldn't leave you to this if there was something that could be done. I'll head to your place first thing in the morning, don't worry bud.\" Matt hung up before you could respond, and you felt a warm feeling in your chest realizing how much he cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only this whole conversation that made you realize how odd your behavior over the past two days has been. Looking down at yourself not only wearing the ultra cute, feminine sleepwear, but being excited to see how good you looked in it was just a prime example. The old you would never have thought that this was the kind of thing you would willingly wear. It was this, and everything, your wardrobe was primarily skirts and dresses, few pants, all types of high heels and lingerie, you referring to women as \"other\" women , and tonight. You actually dressed up, specifically to pick up a guy and were the one to initiate everything. How easy had it been to slip into this Allison persona, even having to remind yourself to respond to Aaron, your real name<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid down on the bed, not even sure how you were going to sleep, knowing that when you wake up, you may never be \"Aaron\" again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You thought on your pleasant dreams, again filled with sexual fantasies of a hot stud giving you a hard fuck. Your eyes snapped open as you realized how wrong that should feel, and the memories of your conversation with Matt rushed forward. \"We have to fix me before I lose myself.\" You called Matt first thing and were relieved when he picked up on the first ring, \"Hi it's Alli- I mean Aaron. I'm up if you want to come over now.\" \"Great, I'll grab my stuff and be over in 15 minutes.\" You hung up and realized that you needed to get ready too before he got here. Not wanting to fall into the feminine mindset you lost yourself in the past two days, you pulled off the nightie and found what male clothes you could find to fit you. You settled on athletic shorts (tightened as much as possible) and old smaller t-shirt. You even wear boxers to reaffirm your maleness to your mind. You shuffled in the ill fitting male clothes, you couldn't put your mind on it, but you could not feel even close comfortable. Everything felt rough, loose, and wrong. \"This is just the mental programming working against me, trying to force me to reject my masculinity.\" You tried to push this out of your mind as much as possible, but as the minutes passed, the discomfort only intensified. Feeling the irritation of the shirt on your breasts, and the looseness of the boxers became too much and you had you an idea, \"Just a bit of femininity won't hurt. This just isn't working.\" Male underwear was just too......impractical, you reasoned, as much as you tried to deny it, your body just requires something else. You had a few minutes before Matt arrived, you could at least put on a bra and panties, something he wouldn't notice and could hopefully relieve you. Even as you attempted to find a plain set, as you searched through your lingerie, you were drawn almost hypnotically to a silk pink bra and thong set. You nearly giggled as you slipped on the lingerie, a feeling of peace washing over you as you felt right at home in the underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMS71o9PSsU/VulFG9g7GmI/AAAAAAAAf8Y/9L-VOiTZIo0HXLBRRWTfa248XXvPq3KLw/s1600/05.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMS71o9PSsU/V...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admired your reflection in the bedroom mirror for a moment, before looking at the male clothes, hesitating </span></div></div>",

Looking down at yourself in your cute bra and panties loving how comfortable they felt and especially how sexy they looked on you. \"I know it should feel weird to think this way, but this may be my last chance to really get use out of what I got yesterday.\" That seemed to make sense as you kicked the disgusting male clothes away and pulled a pair of black yoga pants and a pink spaghetti strap top out and quickly put them on.

Nothing will happen.\" \"You said this project was top secret and you stole it. What if they are only telling you that they will help me to get me to come in to study me?\" \"Aaron, I wouldn't let anything happen to you, you're my best friend.\" You smiled at the concern he was showing you. \"Why don't we stay here for a bit. Maybe I just need to calm my nerves, but I don't want to go just yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt agreed slowly and walked inside, sitting down on the couch as you walked over and turned the TV on. It was Saturday, and you knew Matt would want to watch the game. Putting it on, you found you were getting a bit bored, which was odd, since you liked football since you were a kid, but as the game went on, you found yourself more interested in talking to your friend, who finally started to relax and, after a couple of hours, was getting over his concern and acting normal, seeing that it was still you. You even decided to make lunch for the two of you, feeling a strange sense of pride and smiling a bit when you realized that Matt was stealing glances at your ass when he thought you weren't looking. Matt walked into the kitchen and broke the silence, \"So what have you been doing the past couple of days. I thought you were just mad at me for the other night, but it looks like you were busy. I don't remember you buying a workout outfit the other day.\" You looked down at yourself, \"This? I realized the next morning that I didn't really get anything to lounge around in. It was all tight jeans and that dress. I always heard women talk about how comfortable yoga pants are, so I decided to try them out, and believe me, it isn't just hype!\" You turned and grabbed something something from the lower cabinet, bending over as you did so, \"<i>Did I just do that on purpose to give him a better view of my ass?</i>\" You did start to feel a bit hot as you thought that, and broke the tension, \"Also, while I'm like this, I shouldn't go by Aaron, even if that's an androgynous name. I was going by Allison while I was shopping the other day, let's just use that.\" Matt agreed cautiously, again clearly concerned how accepting you were of your female body and now a female identity. Suddenly I had an idea, hoping to keep the day going, \"Hey, I know. We haven't had a good day of drinking in a while, why don't we open up a bottle of the good scotch I have and play games?\" \"I think that's the best idea you've had all day. You're on!\" Your stomach fluttered as he agreed and you got the bottle and glasses out, pouring for the two of you while Matt set up the game system. You took a sip of the scotch, and were relieved that not only had you kept your taste for it, but it seemed even better than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later and the bottle was nearly empty, Matt having won more football games than he lost, mostly due to you getting hit with the alcohol harder than usual and losing your concentration. This time, it was you stealing glances at your friend, and feeling more and more hot. After the latest match, you stood up, \"I need to use the restroom before we start again, hold on.\" You went up to your bedroom, swinging your hips as you went. Closing your bedroom door, you let out a sigh and starting feeling up your body. What was wrong with you? You knew what this body was doing to your mind, Matt told you as much, but look how easily you gave in your it with this clothing, and Matt......Just being around him was giving you feelings of anxiety........and heat. You couldn't stop thinking about the other night in the shower, your dreams, your near sex with the stranger at the bar. Matt had what you needed, and you knew how to get it, opening the drawer with the sexy lingerie from the other night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Matt heard the clicking of heels on hardwood and turned to see quite a sight:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/73/54/687354547d9397ca1efda4bdd1c009c4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/68/73/54/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled as he looked slack jawed at the gorgeous woman before him, \"Like what you see?\" You asked as you sauntered over to him, stocking legs rubbing together making you even more wet in anticipation. \"Aa-aron?\" Matt stammered as you straddled him on the couch, putting him to silence, \"I told you, it's Allison now, and she needs something from you.\" You pulled him into a deep kiss before he could protest further. Breaking the kiss, \"I want you to fuck me, like you did the other night. Make me scream.\"  </span></div></div>",

The heat between your legs was getting unbearable, with you beginning to rub your hips against Matt. You could feel him getting harder and harder, and you were getting more and more aroused at the thought. Matt's hands fell down at your hips and held you in place. Your whimper of protest turned into a girlish squeal as he lifted you almost effortlessly and began carrying you to the bedroom. The show of dominance from Matt was turning you on all the more. Putting you down on the bed, you quickly helped undress him as he laid on top of you. Your need was now unbearable as you felt him through your panties for only a moment before Matt pulled them off you, followed quickly by your bra. He left your stockings and heels on, and you felt all the hotter for it. \"Are you sure about this Aar-, I mean Allison?\" He asked, and was quickly silenced by your kiss and pulling him to you. With all the answer he needed, Matt positioned himself and thrust in, bringing you to bliss. This was what you wanted, even if you didn't realize it after the shower the other night. You were so confused but now, you knew that you should have continued. Matt continued to pound you sending shock-waves of pleasure, and you loved every minute of it. The difference between tonight and the other night was that there was no male mind of your protesting. You were all woman and loved every minute of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you made love for over an hour, trying a couple of different positions, you even gave Matt a blow job, something you never thought you would do, but here you are having done two in a week as a woman. Finally, resting, you found yourself actually cuddling with your best friend, the embrace after a long sex session feeling so fantastic. It was not long before the two of you fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you awoke feeling something hard on your backside and a heavy over your shoulder. You turned to see Matt, and had a sudden relief that last night was not a dream. Matt woke up as it almost on cue and saw you, looking a bit shocked but remembering last night, apparently as pleasantly as you were, \"Wow, that was...incredible. I don't think I've had sex that good in years with Amber. I needed that. Too bad you have to go back soon, but we'll need to get you to the lab today if we're going to turn you back.\" You dwelt on his words for a moment, staring up at the ceiling and replied....</span></div></div>",

You can't believe that you're a woman now and it's permanent. You also can't believe you've fallen for your best friend. He, of course is hung of his bitch of a wife. \"She doesn't deserve him\", you say slurring your words. You watch as some of these same themes are played out in the movie you're watching. The girl in the movie gets her man, but she's real woman not a pretender like you. It then dawns on you that you're not a pretender. Your the real deal. You're better looking than Amber by far. The only thing she has on you is that she knows how to act like a woman. You jump up from the couch and announce, \"I can do that.\". Though to what end is the question that begs to be answered. You pause for a minute and in drunken inspiration realize that the best plan is to still Matt from her. To save him of course.  </span></div></div>",

You start by doing web searches on movies on how to act more feminine, Miss Congeniality, Pretty Woman (oldy but goody), and various other makeover movies. \"I need a make over\", you decide looking in the mirror. Sure, you have the looks but lack accessories like make-up, hair, and jewelry. \"Matt likes his girls with that shit\", you state. You then giggle at the fact that you're doing this to get Matt, your best friend. \"Fuck, I was a dude a few days ago\", you think. You wonder why you're adapting so fast and acquired a new gender identity in such a short amount of time. Logically, you should still be resistant to the your change. This is a hard thought to hold on to as you're already intoxicated. You start streaming a few movies and grab a pair of high heels that you bought on the insistence of a sales clerk. It only takes you a few minutes to realize women are crazy to wear these things. They hurt and it throws your balance way off. They also cause you to stick your ass out when you wear them. \"Fuck\" you mutter after the third time falling. You keep going until you figure it out. You practice other feminine habits which the movies insist men like, playing with your hair, biting your lip, and such shit. Some of it makes sense and you remember thinking it as cute when you saw women do it. You do look hot walking around in high heels wearing nothing but a matching bra and panties. \"I can do this. Amber, watch out bitch, Matt is my man\", you laugh and then immediately pass out.</span></div></div>",

It seems irrational you should feel this way about the situation, but you're to hungover for rational thought at the moment. You know that you love him and Amber will just hurt him again. You step into the shower and the hot water begins to help a little with clearing your head. \"I do love Matt. He's my best friend\", you think to yourself trying to sort out your feelings. It seemed pretty clear last night when you were drunk. In the back of you mind a little voice is telling that this is wrong. You're a man after all. \"A man, right. I'm a woman\", you mutter out loud. It's undeniable, you're a woman. Your feelings are also undeniable. You do love Matt. You can listen to the little voice and not have him in your life, or ignore it, accept your new reality, and get him. Having him not in your life is unacceptable and feels you with a sense of loss. \"I want him and I'm going to have him\", you state. The little voice in the back of your mind balks at the idea. It tells you that it's completely irrational, but then when have you known a rational woman. You'll need some work, hair, nails, makeup, and jewelry. \"I need to get going\", you think.</span></div></div>",

It was a relief since for you after seeing one woman getting waxed. You still had your eyebrows plucked, not pleasant. Another feature is that your ears and bellybutton already were pierced. They were just waiting for jewelry. Your tongue was also pierced, but you skipped getting a stud for that, at the moment. They helped you with makeup, picking the right colors not only for you but ones you knew Matt would like. You knew you were a woman already, but looking in the mirror right now it's even more obvious. \"Wow\", you mutter shaking your head! You pick up a few more things for later and then contemplate your next move.

What that move is you're still working on. You think back to dates you had when you were still a man and what women did to raise your interest. Your urge is to just jump him and go total slut, but you realize that would be a bad move. You need him interested and to make a move first. \"Shit, how could he not be interested\", you state staring down at your abundant cleavage. Your nipples grow hard just thinking about Matt's hands on them. \"Calm down, calm down\", you say to yourself. You know you should be appalled at the idea of trying seduce another man, but at the same time this transformation has left you feeling excited and full of energy. It's like you're high, or something. The world seems so fresh with new opportunities. You again wonder if that serum, or whatever it was affected you mentally. The though is moot as there is no reversing it. Your only choice is to ride the wave. \"And Matt's cock\", you moan thinking about him. You make it home and spend a few hours pacing the house and trying on different outfits waiting for the right time to call Matt. You wait till well after lunch before calling him. \"Hey Matt, just calling to see if you want to come over and talk about how things went with Amber\", you state when he answers? Matt begins to tell you, but you stop him and tell him, \"Just tell me when you get over. I got a bottle of our favorite bourbon ready.\" Matt laughs and says he'll e right over.

Sure, it make no sense if you think about it, but when do women ever make sense? You feel like you're being tossed around in a sea of emotions. You have little control only trying to stay afloat while the current carries you in one direction. Matt arrives and you meet hi at the door. Just seeing him causes your nipples to ache.

Then you can tell me how I went with Amber\", you say. Matt complies and you're soon sitting on the couch with him. The bourbon burns your throat like it never has before.

You can see that he wants you. \"Matt, I don't know why this has happened, but I see it as an opportunity for us. You're my best friend, but we can now be something even better. No woman will ever know you better than I do, ever treat you as good as I can\", you state. You lean in and kiss him again. Matt's resistance begins to fade and you then straddle him as you continue to kiss. \"I want you, Matt\", you moan into his ear. He helps you pull your dress over your head leaving you in your bra and panties. You start unbuttoning his shirt as you continue to kiss. His tongue tastes so good. You grind against his pants feeling his erection grow. Knowing you're turning him on turns you on even more. \"I need you\", you moan. Matt unhooks your bra exposing your huge breasts. Matt fondles and sucks your aching nipples sending ripples of pleasure though you. You never imagined that it could feel this good. Matt flips you over so he's on top. With one swift motion Matt pulls down your panties and goes down on you. \"Holy shit\", you exclaim as his tongue hits your clit. You've had oral in the past, but having a clit sucked sure beats having your cock sucked. \"Oh shit, yes\", you scream, you're voice trembling. \"Oh fuck\", you shout as you climax. \"You're easy\", Matt laughs lifting his head. You're still trying to focus. That was insanely good. \"I'm just getting started if you're up to it\", Matt states. Matt stands and you notice that he's removed his pants. His cock is huge and your eyes fixate on it. \"Ready for more\", he asks? \"Hell yes\", you growl. Any reservations you had about having sex with another man or Matt seem stupid. You want to feel this way forever. With Matt's cock just hanging there you get an urge and go for it. It only seems fair sex he got you off by sucking your clit to suck his cock. You grab his cock and start sucking. You expected it to be horrible, but discover it doesn't taste bad at all and also causes your own arousal to start to build again. \"Damn, you're good at this\", Matt moans. You come up for a second and reply, \"I know what men really like. I'm not some clueless bitch. I also know you don't like getting off this way so why don't you stick this thing in my pussy and fuck the shit out of me.\" Matt's smile nearly stretches across his face. You turn around and bend over the couch. \"I know you like it like this\", you state. You feel him grab your hips and you await with anticipation to feel his cock enter you. It seems like forever before you finally feel the tip of it pressing against your womanhood. \"Fuck me\", you beg starting to get impatient. You feel him plunge his cock into you. It hurts and feels good at the same time. He feels like he's shoving a telephone pole in there. The pain soon vanishes leaving only pleasure. It's not like the dildo you've been using. Matt's cock is alive and warm. It moves and throbs inside you. Feminine moans and squeals of joy involuntarily burst out from you. Your crossover to becoming a woman is finished.</span></div></div>",

You're probably interested in sex though. I can't honestly say the sex is better. It's different, but saying it's better I don't think would be fair. It takes longer to get things going as a woman as opposed to a man, but once they do, oh boy. The orgasms are pretty intense, but I don't know if that's because it's new to me or what. It's like the orgasms you had when you were a teenager, except multiple.\" Matt laughs and says, \"Now I wish I'd gotten the shot like I had planned.\" You feel his hand cup your breasts and you snuggle tighter against him. \"How about mentally, are you still the same\", Matt asks? You figure this is what he meant the whole time. He wants to know if you being with him is real or a product of the serum. \"I'm still me. I still like the same things, think the same way, for the most part. I still love you\", you reply. Matt sighs and says, \"Except now you like guys instead of girls.\" You've pondered this as well. \"When I think of being with a woman the way I am now it feels wrong. I was a straight guy. Men should be with women and women with men. Now that I'm a woman it only makes sense to me that I should be with a man.

What did you do to me\", you shout? Matt looks away and explains, \"It was meant for me. I thought if I was a woman Amber would take me back. I was drunk and wasn't thinking straight\". You shake your head and reply with, \"Ok, I can see that, but how did this happen\"? You motion to your body with the hand not covering your breasts. Matt sighs and says, \"You remember that bio-tech company that we wrote all the specialized software for 10 months ago? When I was working on the computers in their lab on that DNA mapping program I overheard that the invented a way to completely rewrite someone's DNA. They were trying to be hush about it, but they were excited. I heard them say they had mapped some college girls DNA and spliced it into some retro-bio-tech virus nanite, or something. When the weren't looking I stole one of the vials. I don't know why, I just did. When this crap happened with Amber I took it as a sign. That it was the reason that I stole the vial. I didn't even in my wildest dreams thought you would come barging into the room trying to take it from me. I never meant for you to, you know. Why did you do that\"? You raise your eyebrows and answer, \"Because I thought you were trying to kill yourself. You're my best friend and I love you. I didn't want to see you die\".

You'll never cheat on him the way Allison did. Matt also reads a email between the scientists speaking of a way to remotely adjust the programming. It doesn't go into detail, but there is a way. Matt can't imagine why they would want to adjust the programming the way you're acting any man would be pleased. The programming can even be reversed. There is no mention of reversing the transformation though. Matt is a little torn on what to do. On the one hand you're happy this way even if it's been programmed.

You took something from the lab.\" You see Matt shrug and answers, \"I have no idea what you're talking about. You must have been misinformed.\" The scientists laugh and say, \"Matt, we tracked the signal to this house. When you showed up it made sense. What you didn't know about our side project is that once the nanites colonized they began broadcasting a signal on a very specific frequency. That tells us that you've also used it on someone. Seeing that you're not a busty young beauty we're guessing it wasn't you. We've seen someone moving around in the house before you got home so we know you're not alone. A quick property search indicated that this house belongs to your partner, Aaron. Strange thing is that the property search showed that Aaron now spells her name Erin. Doesn't take genius, even though we are, to figure out who it was used on. That was a pretty sick thing to do to your best friend. Does she know what the serum has done to her? Does she know the feelings she has for you is because there programmed and being maintained by the nanites running a subroutine in her system?\" You heard enough. You step forward and shout, \"I love Matt and loved him before I was transformed. No nanites are needed for me to know that!\" Seeing you they shake their heads. \"Are you sure about that? That can be confirmed. We can turn off the mental programming. You're mind will no longer be influenced by the nanites.\" Your jaw drops and you reply, \"You can turn me back into a man.\" \"No, nothing can do that. The change is permanent, but the mental changes will reverse after the subroutine is turned off.\" One of the scientists pulls out a device. \"No\", Matt shouts! </span></div></div>",

You can wear her stuff. You could even stay at my place until we can get this figured out\". You see the look on his face and the way he's eyeballing you. \"What a great idea.

This is my body, sort of. The real Amber still has her body and has run off with her lesbo girlfriend. They're probably licking each other's pussies right now. Get up off the coach and head over to your house. I need to get some better clothes and a bra.\" With that you head over to Matt's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now that you've gotten to move around in your new body some more you find it strangely comfortable. You're center of gravity is lower and you feel less bulky, even with the enormous tits. The only disturbing things is all the jiggling flesh and gyrating hips. You find you have to take smaller steps just to keep things from shaking. Girls clothes, even though they look tight, are light, airy, and comfortable to wear. The hair is a bitch though. It flies everywhere and gets in your face. Matt though it would be a good idea to take the top down on the car. It feels like you've got a sail on your head. You distract yourself from this self examination by going over the immediate problem of how to get back to normal. The stolen serum Matt used is all used up. The chances of getting more are less than zero considering the place he stole it from. Everything there looked like it could be moved quickly and the security cards you were issued were probably canceled as soon as the job was completed. Not to mention if What Matt overheard was correct you couldn't even change back if you had more of the serum. No matter what angle you mentally approach the problem it seems to come to the same conclusion, You're now Amber, at least another Amber anyway, and it doesn't look like that's going to change. The thought of being stuck like this the rest of your life makes you furious at Matt. You then tell yourself that you share some of the blame. If you hadn't gotten up when you did and wrestled with him for the syringe it would have been Matt sport a pair of big tits right now. You know why you did it though and you don't regret your reasoning. He's your best friend and you love him despite him being an idiot about everything that's not inside a computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Matt pulls into his driveway and you head in. He doesn't have to tell you where to go, you've been to his house many times. Sorting through Amber's things is another story. She has nearly the entire Master closet filled with stuff and one of the guest bedroom closets. Not being picky you grab the first bra you can find, not really concerned if it matches the panties you're wearing. You strip down to change. You then hear Matt clear his throat. You turn to se him staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bustygirlsonline.com/photo/large/3/5/0/1/__brandy-robbins-pink-top-and-denim-shorts-shows-her-boobs-17_busty-girls-online__35015.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://bustygirlsonline.com/photo/large/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt\", you squeal surprised by the pitch of your voice.

I'm just feeling weird right now\". Matt shrugs and laughs, \"It's ok.

The only things she's really good at is looking good and spending money. You get dressed and head out. Matt wants to go to Joey's Grill. It's a favorite of you both, though usually not for lunch. Matt drives being the man. It's kind of bugging you how he's treating you differently now, but understandable. All he sees when he looks at you is his wife. It has to be weird for him. With you not screaming at him every five minutes, or nagging the shit out of him it must seem like when they first started dating. She was a sweetheart back then. Of course she was trying to hook him. You pull into the parking lot of Joey's. Matt opens the door for you. You just stand there staring at him. \"What\", he inquires like he doesn't understand? \"Matt, I'm still me, Aaron. Dude, stop treating me like I'm your wife\", you reply. Matt immediately apologizes. You go in and despite it not being your usual time several of the regulars are there. \"Hey Matt, you finally brought that wife of yours you're always bragging about. Amber, right\", Joey shouts from behind the bar? You just smile and nod your head. \"Where's Aaron at today. Usually you two are stuck at the hip\", Joey states as you sit down. Joey makes it over to the table to personally take your order. \"Aaron couldn't make it today, Joey. He's on a business trip. I'm not sure when he'll be back\", Matt says answering Joey's question. Joey laughs, looks at you, and says, \"Good to finally meet you, miss. I was starting to think you didn't exist. I thought Matt here was gay the way him and Aaron always hung out. You better watch that Aaron guy. He's liable to steal your guy.\" You turn red at that statement. \"I, Aaron is not that way I assure you. He's only interested in women\", you state flatly. Joey holds his hands up and says, \"I was just making fun, miss. I didn't mean to get you upset.\" Matt grabs your hand and says, \"Honey, you know I told you about Joey's sense of humor. Just order your drink.\" You gently pull your hand away from Matt, though you'd like to deck him for that honey part. \"Sorry Joey, Aaron is a real good friend and he's going through some tough changes right now. I guess I'm feeling a little sensitive right now. I'll have a Sam Adams\", you state. \"No problem\", Joey states and then takes Matt's order. When Joey is out of ear shot Matt says, \"Amber doesn't drink beer.\" \"I'm not fucking Amber\", you fire back! Matt settles back in his chair and mumbles, \"Shit, must be getting your period or something.\" You feel the fires start to blaze inside. \"I'm not getting my fucking period, you ass. I'm stuck as a big breasted bimbo because I was trying to be a good friend. No I have a bunch of guys at the back table of what was once my favorite place staring at my tits, undressing me with their eyes. I'm sure I've been mind fucked a few times already. I'm so uncomfortable right now. I doesn't help that the only clothes I have to wear would make a porn star blush.\" You see Matt deflate and he says, \"I'm sorry, do you want to leave. We can get something to go.\"</span></div></div>",

In fact you were doing the same thing a few days ago when you were in here with Matt and that blonde walked in. You suddenly feel like an ass for the things that went through your mind that day involving her. It's a lot different when you're on the receiving end. You wonder for a minute if this is God's way of teaching you a lesson. If it is you wish that it wasn't so permanent. He could have also picked someone other than your best friends wife to turn you into. If Matt had gotten the sampling done right you could be looking like Amber's girlfriend. You have no idea what she looks like, but it has to be better than being Amber. \"I've got to use the bathroom\", you say to Matt wanting to get away from the guys glancing over at you and smiling. You know what they're thinking. You get up and head for the bathroom, pausing in front of the doors for a second. You just do catch yourself starting to go into the men's room. \"That would have been bad\", you mutter turning the other way into the ladies room. You didn't need to go. You just decided to hide out until the order comes. You'll then step out and leave with Matt.</span></div></div>",

Along the way you discuss what to do. Matt has already come up with a few ideas. He'll try locating the scientist that he stole the formula from. Matt confesses he planted a backdoor into the software you both created for them. It's tricky though. If they find out you can expect some government goons to show up at your door. Of course that depends on you finding them. You remember that they had their server disconnected from the internet. That means they had a closed network. Someone will have to make a mistake before you can even ping the software. After that you can cause a bug in the software and hope they call you to fix it. They also may call the people you sold your company to. There are a lot of ifs with the plan and you don't hold out much hope that it'll work. In the meantime you'll need to deal with being a woman.

Especially since the chances of finding a fix is pretty slim. We can just come up with another identity for me. I can change my appearance. We can launch a worm that will change every computerized document that has anything to do with me. We can have if change all records to show that I'm female and my name is Erin instead of Aaron\", you explain. You see Matt working that over in his brain. He swallows a bite of his lunch and replies with, \"It would take some time to design a worm like that.\" You turn a little red and say, \"I designed one a few years ago to search out my records and erase them if needed. We'll just need to change a few lines of code to have it change the record instead of erasing it. It's already inserted into the IRS, Office of Vital Statistics, DMV, and several other databases. It was one of those what if I needed to disappear someday things.\" Matt starts laughing and then shouts, \"Ha, and you always said I was the paranoid hacker!\" You throw a french-fry at him. \"It's not paranoia, it's insurance\", you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After lunch you both get started working on the code for the worm. It's rather easy as the worm already exists and you're done in two hours. You sit there in front of the computer staring at the screen. \"You do the honors\", Matt says proudly. Your finger hovers over the mouse button. With one click you'll be officially a woman as far as any computerized database out there is concerned. You estimate it'll take only a few days before every record is altered. You'll have a new identity, Aaron will never have existed. You wonder for a second if you're being to rash. \"Maybe this formula will wear off in a few days. We should just give this some time\", you think. You know it's not a sound argument. You trust Matt when he said he understood that the change was permanent. This isn't a cold or something you get over. That stuff altered your DNA, rewrote it to match Amber's.</span></div></div>",

Since her tastes were different from hers you've done some shopping. That was more difficult than you thought it would be. Thankfully the sales clerk, Heidi, was more than happy to help you to get a sale. The clothes are fashionable without being slutty as Amber's stuff was. You also got yourself a complete makeover, though that wasn't your intent. You just didn't want to see Amber's face looking back at you every time you looked in the mirror. A new hairstyle and color really changed that. You've also spent some time in the tanning booth. You feel you're becoming your own woman and not just an Amber clone. You've also been working to tone up your physique. You weren't bad, but you always did like being fit. You at the very least want to work up to close to where you were as a guy. You find it strange how quickly you've accepted this. Not that you had any choice. You've been hanging out with Matt a bit. Not the way he would like though. You admit it's fun to torture him at times. You've even put on some of the risqu\u00e9 things that you borrowed from Amber's closet when he came over for game night. You caught him staring more than once. You now understand why girls enjoy doing it. You also admit that masturbating as a woman is fun. You can only imagine what it would be like to actually have sex as a woman. Your curiosity almost got to you a few nights ago after a few glasses of wine during the previously mentioned game night. You noticed Matt's boner after you bent over to pick something off the floor. For a minute you pictured in your mind riding it, having it slide into you instead of the vibrator you bought a week ago. There were also the downside of being a chick. You just got over your first period a week ago. It was probably the most disturbing thing you've ever gone through. The hormones weren't nearly as bad as they were made out to be. You barely noticed the mood swings. Matt stated he noticed. Right now you're.....................</span></div></div>",

You hang up and start sifting through clothes again. You find a top left by a girlfriend two years ago stashed in the closet. It's tight over your chest, but not to bad. It shows off your cleavage nicely. You slide on a pair of wedges and take another look in the mirror. The hair is still in good shape. You don't really need or care for make-up, but decide to put on some lipstick. They gave you some free samples the other day at the store. You've been watching the other girls put it on and try to duplicate what they did. You nail it with the first try. \"Not bad\", you say with a smile. You then remember something else. You go through a stack of women's magazines you bought the other day and find a perfume sample. You gently rub this on your neck and chest. Just as you're finishing you hear Matt drive up. You quick toss of the hair and you rush downstairs to great him. You've never felt this giddy before. He's coming in just as you make it down the stairs. </span></div></div>",

You sit there panting on the floor having what can only be a anxiety attack. Matt suddenly comes rushing in. \"Aaron, you're awake\", he exclaims.

You don't even care that you're naked. He's seen you naked before and judging from the fact you're naked now he probably has seen you naked as you are now. Matt then stands there for a few seconds though it feels like minutes before saying anything. He then looks away and says, \"That syringe had what the lab guys called dream girl juice. It's really a designer retro-virus that inserts a custom DNA strand into a living organism.\" You hold your hand up and ask, \"What lab guys.\" Matt looks back at you and answers, \"Nova Labs.\" Horror comes over you as you remember that job. It was only a few months ago. You found out real quick Nova Labs was a government black ops front. Matt and you were writing them new DNA mapping software. It allows them to map a persons DNA completely in minutes. \"Nova Labs! I'm guessing the lab guy didn't just give this to you\", you state. Matt shakes his head and says, \"No, it was something they were developing as a sort of joke for themselves. They were creating what they would consider being their dream girl. They put together DNA from several donors. I overheard them yapping about it for days. When they finished I stole a vial. They had like tow dozen and I figured they wouldn't miss it. Even if they did I figured they wouldn't report it since it wasn't a sanctioned job.\" You sit there mulling that over. In another part of your mind you recall how such a virus would work. It seems strange, but your mind seems to be working much better now. You already know the answer, but ask the question anyway, \"I don't guess you stole an antidote?\"  </span></div></div>",

Once infected with this virus your body would develop antibodies to the virus. A second shot of the virus would not be effective, or only partial effective.

Your aching nipples brush against the desk as you scoot the chair closer. You immediately wonder how many women have secretary jobs where they have to sit behind a desk all day with these things in the way. Then again outside of pornos few secretaries are stacked like you are. After some creative coding you launch a very specific virus that will target only Aaron J. Miller's information.

The next problem to present itself is shoes. Not to many girls and none of the ones you've had over ever left their shoes. Your male shoes are way to big for your dainty feet.

You try to remember if there is a certain way women hold their purse. \"Time for a field study\", you laugh.<br>\r\n   You step out of the house and get into your car. You spend several minutes adjusting everything and still can't seem to get things right. The seat was way to far back for you only illustrating how much shorter you are now. When you slid it forward to where your feet could reach the pedals your breasts brushed the steering wheel. Another thing you discover about large breasts is that they're not seatbelt friendly. \"Figures, men design cars for themselves\", you mutter under your breath a little amazed that in less than a few hours you're already identifying with women. You shrug and start up the car. Your enhanced intellect tells you that it's the virus that is causing you to accept all of this without a fight, but it doesn't really matter why. You feel good. </span></div></div>",

Your plan all the time was to hit the biggest designer store and get everything you need at one store. You don't plan on spending the whole day shopping. You start in and immediately feel over your head. You never noticed that more then 3/4 of the store is devoted to women. \"Crap\", you mutter looking at the selection. You start flipping tags and find the sizing completely alien. As a guy you would just grab an XL shirt and a pair of 32\"x34\" pants and you were done. Women's clothes are a lot more complicated. The clothing is sectioned of into girl's, misses, petites, and women's. Inside those sections you find sizes come in numbers instead of being straight forward like small, medium, large, and such. You have no idea what a size 4 pants is supposed to mean. Fortunately a clerk sees you and comes over. She looks you up and down quickly and asks, \"Can I help you?\" You seen that look before. It's not new to you that women size each other more than men do. You also know the best way to get past that. Women can't resist a tragic story. You do your best teary eyed look, which is hard considering the alterations to your brain chemistry, and say, \"My house burned down last night and I've lost everything. If I hadn't gotten these clothes from the Red Cross I'd be wearing my pajamas. I've been up all night. I can't even see straight right now. My husband gave my $10,000 and said I should go while he handled everything at our home (Sniffle), what's left of it. I don't know if I can do this.\" The clerk's face immediately changed from harsh judgement to concern. \"Oh you poor dear, don't worry. I'll help you. Something like this happened to my sister in Florida a couple years back with a hurricane\", says the clerk who later identifies herself a Amanda. You smile inwardly as you keep up the act on the outside. Amanda makes some calls and the next thing you know you have three more clerks helping you out. They have you trying on different outfits and giving advise. You never have to leave the changing area. You soak it all in taking mental notes on not only what they're saying, but their mannerisms, speech patterns, and behaviors. The next thing you know you have $3000 worth of clothing and you haven't even started on shoes and underwear. The clerk named Gabby pulls you over and starts matching up outfits to shoes. As with the clothes none of this at first makes any sense to you. Then it's almost as if a switch goes off and it all starts making sense. You start seeing the pattern in the clothes and the shoes. \"Wow, I've got a fashion sense\", you mutter to yourself. You spend a couple more thousand in shoes. You even put on one of the more casual outfits with matching shoes to continue shopping. \"I really need some bras. Can you show me those next\", you ask Gabby. The black clerk, Tabatha laughs and says, \"Girl, you don't want to wear any of the crap we sell here. It's for old ladies and fat white people. You get yourself down to Victoria's Secret. My sister works there. I'll her and tell her you're coming over.\" \"Victoria's Secret\", you reply? She smiles and says, \"Yeh girl, it's down just past the food court.\" Amanda interrupts with, \"You may want to get one our old people's bras if unless you want to get a lot od attention on the way to the food court. The ladies help size you up and Tabatha picks out one that she considers not to white for you. You put it on and agree that it looks much better than free boobing in the outfit you're wearing.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully they're holding your purchases there for you as you continue to shop. As you're walking through the mall you're amazed that you're actually even able to walk. Gabby picked out a pair of what she called sensible yet fashionable shoes for you to wear. You have to admit they're a lot more comfortable than you thought they'd be. Then again it's only a 2\" heal at best. Even so you're proud of yourself for be able to walk in them. You find it erotic how the breeze blows up your dress and the fabric of it brushes against your legs. You find yourself scanning the store on the way to VC's and imagine yourself wearing some of the things you see. As you pass by the jewelry store you realize that you don't have any. Your ears aren't even pierced. You wonder if the other girls noticed. \"What does it matter what they thought\", you think to yourself. You walk into VC's and are immediately greeted by a very exuberant black clerk named Pamela. It seems Tabatha, as promised, called. Not only did she call but apparently relayed your size, which happens to be 32DD. Pamela has already picked out a slew of bras and panties for you. It all looks like the kind of stuff Amanda would wear. Pamela insists that you try everything on since you may require a different size for different cuts. You actually understand what she means. Something you picked up at the other store. Your increased intellect is coming in handy today, but it's more than that. You feel something else. It dawns on you as you're staring at yourself in the dressing room. \"I feel like a woman\", you state. You realize it feels good. You end up buying enough for a different matching set for three weeks. You even get a couple of sexy things for yourself to wear around the house. Just thinking about slipping into them turns you on. On your way out you stop by the jewelry store again. You see a sign on the window saying they do piercings. You smile to yourself and...............    </span></div></div>",

The obviously gay man working there at first seems surprised that you've never pierced your ears. You make up a story about your parents being ultra religious. Lying seems to come easier as a woman. He laughs and replies with, \"I know how it is, honey. My daddy was a minister. Let's get you set up.

It doesn't hurt nearly as much as you thought it would, but something else happens when he pierces you. Neither of you notice when he did your ears, but Lars notices when he does your belly button. \"You didn't bleed at all\", he remarks. He then looks closer and says, \"You're completely healed, your ears to.\" You shrug and reply with, \"I'm a fast healer.\" You attempt to stay calm, but inside you realize that no one heals that fast. This is something you've got to check out later. Lars is clearly shaking by it, but pretends it didn't happen instead of dwelling on it. You think your stars that he's a liberal that will just believe what he's told instead of dealing with disturbing truths. Lars sells you a few pairs of earrings, belly button rings, and other pieces of jewelry. You probably should go home now and investigate this whole quick healing thing, but the shopping bug has gotten you. One thing left to get at the mall is makeup.

The girls set you up with a huge sample bag of perfumes, body lotions, and such. You have to have help to carry it all to your car.

There is no way you're going to ask a stranger about this one. You pull out your phone and start googling and within minutes know more than you ever wanted know about feminine hygiene products.

You start to walk by the hair products isle and then step back. \"I do have a lot of hair now\", you think to yourself.

You're not sure what a loofah is but another woman through one in her cart. You then grab a new tooth brush. For some reason your old man brush weird. You've always had a phobia about using someone else's toothbrush. It seems strange that you're thinking about your old male self as somebody else.

You're proud of yourself how quickly you learned to walk in them. You've always been one to adapt quickly. You didn't even hear the door open over the clacking of your heels.

You kick off the heels and cover up with the matching silk rope from the nighty set your bought. You noticed how Matt looked at you just then. Once over the shock you reflect on how Matt just looked at you. You could see the lust in his eyes and it turned you on. \"Get a hold of yourself, girl. It's Matt\", you say to yourself. You then realize you referred to yourself as girl. You look down and say, \"It's true.\" You then walk back out to find Matt standing in the kitchen unpacking a bag of food. \"I'm sorry about barging in without knocking. I got us some food. I figured you might be hungry being cooped up all day\", he states. He only glances at you quickly and then looks away. You see his face long enough to see that it's red. He's standing behind the counter in such a way that you can't see, but you'd bet he has a hard-on. You strangely feel flattered. You did invest a lot into your looks today. \"Thanks, you're a life saver. I did get out today, but just realized I haven't had a thing to eat today\", you reply. Matt gives you a nervous smile. It's not something you're used to seeing from him. You start moving in his direction and his face changes to near panic. \"Just go have a seat and I'll bring it to you\", he blurts out. You decide to save him them embarrassment. A thought flashes through your mind, \"I wonder how big it is.\" You shake the thought out. It's ridiculous for a few reasons. One you know how big it is, you've seen it. Back in college nearly everyone on campus got to see it. You reflect back to those memories picturing him naked. This causes your nipples to tingle. You glance to see where Matt is at and try to rub the feeling away, but only manage to make it worse. Your nipples are showing through the silk like material of the robe. You adjust it so it's not right against you. Meanwhile Matt is doing his own adjusting. \"Dude, it's Aaron, but damn she's sexy\", he tells himself. He tries to push the memory of you in that transparent nighty out of his mind, but knows he'll be masturbating to it tonight. A thought that brings him much embarrassment. He sets the plate of food in front of you and refills you wine before pouring himself a glass of scotch. You catch a glance at his bulge as he quickly sits down hiding it from your view. You eat a few bites and immediately start feeling better. \"You're such a gentleman, Matt. On our next date can you take me someplace nicer than my house\", you say teasingly. Matt's face goes red again. \"This is fun\", you think to yourself finally understanding why past girlfriends did it to you.   </span></div></div>",

You then move done kissing every inch down his chest. \"Aaron, please\", He says trying to dig up the strength to resist, and reason what's happening. When you get to his pants you rip them off with the same vigor you did his shirt. His cock flies free and nearly slaps you in the face. It looks so big. You have to know what it taste like. You want the full girl experience. You go down on it with your mouth. Any resistance Matt had left vaporizes. \"Oh shit, yesss\", he moans grabbing the back of your head. You find that once you get past the muskiness it's real good. You've had some good blow jobs in the past and you now put those memories to use. You work him for a few seconds and then taste his pre-cum. You realize if you keep working him like this he's going to cum in your mouth. You pull the condom you stashed in the pocket of you robe and roll it over his cock. You then straddle him down on the couch again. Only this time there is nothing between you and his cock but a thin piece of latex. You guide the tip of his penis in to the entrance of your soaking wet pussy and drop down. Both of you wince with a mixture of pleasure and pain, but mostly pleasure. After the initial impaling he's sliding easily into you. You begin grinding your clit against him. You can tell he's close and you want to cum together. His hand wrap behind and grab your rounded ass. They then start moving up you taper to your thin waist. Then further up to your tits. You're more than a handful. He pulls you down and starts sucking your tits. \"Oh shit, yes, yes, suck those tits, Matt\", you cry out. Waves of pleasure start building up inside you. It's like a pot on a stove. It just builds and builds. Then all of a sudden it bursts free. \"Oh fuck, yes\", you scream. The whole world disappears around you. You feel as if you're going to pass out. As the world starts to come into focus again you're trembling and gasping for air. \"Oh my gawd, do it again\", you gasp! </span></div></div>",

You catching yourself looking over at Matt and wandering what other positions to try and remember how good his cock felt inside you. Your nipples have been hard and aching for hours. \"Damn, I need to be fucked\", you keep thinking to yourself. Your enhanced intellect seems dampened by these urges. You try to get to sleep, but the last time you tried Matt nearly wrecked because you started to finger yourself in your sleep. During the lunch stop you rush to the lady's room and masturbate in one of the stalls trying to relieve the pressure. It takes the edge off, but only briefly. An hour back on the road and you find yourself thinking about screwing Matt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I've had enough driving for the day\", Matt sighs around 6pm. He pulls into a hotel. You get out and rent a room while Matt fills the gas and finds a parking space. You text him the room number and after nearly an hour he makes it in. He walks in and immediately notice only the one king size bed. \"Was this your idea\", he asks? You laugh and respond with, \"It's all they had available. Can we get something to eat, I'm starved.\" The truth is you did chose it intentionally. You have to have him again or you'll loose your mind. At diner you make sure Matt has a few drinks. After the forth shot Matt asks, \"Are you trying to get me drunk?\" You smile and answer with, \"I'm just trying to help you relax. I know you've been stressed out about all of this.\" He laughs and replies with, \"I have been. I can't imagine how you feel though. This has to be weirding you out.\" You shrug and say, \"I don't know why, but I'm just feel ok with it.\" You buy him another shot. You've already thought this through. Matt is usually at his peak with the fifth, any further and he'll be useless to you. You rub up beside him and say, \"Time to get you to bed, tiger.\" In Matt's drunken state his body reacts to you touch in a positive way. Your body is also reacting to being so close. You help him up and move as fast as you can for the elevator. \"Whoa, why so fast, lets hit the town and get some babes, Erin\", Matt states. You shake your head and state with an almost feral growl, \"I need to get you in bed, now.\" You jerk him into the elevator and drag him to room. You can barely get the door open as your hands are shaking. Once inside you throw yourself at him, burying your tongue into his mouth in a kiss. You rip off his shirt and push him back onto the bed. \"Erin, stop, we can't do this again\", he shouts! You're so filled with lust you don't even hear him. You strip down his pants to reveal his glorious cock. It stands at attention for you. You go down on him and take that wondrous thing into your mouth. \"Erin, we can't\", Matt moans. </span></div></div>",

You look over to see Matt has passed out already. \"You earned it, buddy\", you giggle. You go to stand and nearly fall down. Your legs feel like jello. You steady yourself and feel something leaking out. \"Oh shit, I forgot the condoms\", you realize. This brings you back to reality. You rush to the bathroom and sit on the toilet. You try to push it all out of you. The flow seems never ending. Matt unloaded a gallon in to you. \"Crap, crap\", you mutter. You start calculating in your mind the possibility that you may be pregnant. Regular girls don't get pregnant every time they have sex. You figure the nerd would won't a pregnant dream girl.

Matt was always the better one with people. He made the sell and you did the numbers. Right now you're back on the road. Your eyes drift down to your abundant cleavage. You're still amazed by your transformation. Not only the physical, but how quickly you've become comfortable with it. Aside from being horny all the time you can't really say you feel different. You're not a different person. You do a mental inventory. You still like all the same things. It's not like your favorite singers have suddenly become Cher or other girly singers. \"Though, the Taylor Swift song on the radio right now is good\", you think to yourself. You like the sensations you now can experience in this body and you love the sex. You always thought women had the short end of the stick when it came to sex. You were clearly wrong. Having breasts is interesting as well. They jiggle and bounce all the time. You're kind of glad the scientist that whipped up this batch wasn't into flat chested girls. Having nipples the size of pencil erasers is a bit of a novelty. You're downright amazed how sensitive they are and how erect they can get. You unconsciously start running your finger around them, watching them grow and poke through the fabric of the dress you're wearing. matt suddenly runs off the road and then jerk the car back on. You look over and see his face is red. \"Could you please stop doing that while I'm driving\", he states sternly. You then realize what you were doing. You reply with a shrug and, \"Sorry, they're really cool to play with. It's even better when they're sucked.\" \"I know\", Matt grumbles while adjusting himself. You bite your lip and then say, \"Sorry again, I could help you with that.\" Matt just shakes his head and mutters something under his breath. You sit back and try to pay more attention to what you're doing. It doesn't help that you've gotten yourself turned on again. Not to mention that now that you know Matt has an erection you can't help but look at it. \"Never would have done that as a guy\", you say to yourself realizing another change since the transformation. \"Of course back then he could shove that in my pussy and give me an orgasm\", you think and giggle out loud. Matt gives you another stern look when he sees where your eyes are at. You start feeling wet between the legs. \"Ok, stop it, Erin\", you think to yourself. </span></div></div>",

You think of other men, famous actors, and such and they don't raise your interests. \"Why is Matt different\", you ponder? Your new mind is geared for this sort of intellectual endeavor.

You've always been there for each other. You know him even better than his wife. You love the guy. That thought hits you like a ton of bricks. \"I love him\", you whisper low enough so that Matt can't hear it.

You have no frame of reference to guide you on how to behave. \"Ah, ah I\", you manage to mumble. \"Looks like you could use another drink\", he says motioning the bartender. \"You strike me as a Scotch kind of girl\", he says with a smile. \"Oh my gawd, how does he know I like Scotch\", is your first thought. The shock is wearing off and you increased intellect starts kicking in. You then figure this isn't his first time doing this. Moat girls don't drink Scotch and he probably figures he'll get you drunk. Worse, the bartender may be in on the scam. \"I wish Matt was here\", you think to yourself.  </span></div></div>",

A grin plastered all over your face, you can't feel anything but the all encompassing sense of lust coming over you, driving every other thought from your mind except that you just <i>have to</i> have Matt's cock inside you. You see Matt's cock under that all too thin but yet seemingly unbreakable barrier that is his underwear, bulging but somehow gradually shrinking. Matt does everything he can to keep you from pulling his underwear down, but that only seems to make you even more horny. \"I HAVE to HAVE it!\" you shout in a lustful frenzy as you start trying to tear the underwear to bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT!!!\" You yell again at Aaron as they begin to literally claw at your underwear trying to rip them to shreds like a rabid animal. With any other woman in the world you would be going along with this gladly, but this was AARON for god's sake. Your buddy for as long as you can remember now turned into this lust crazed woman. Despite your confused libido earlier, all you can feel is revulsion as your best friend tries with all their might to get at your cock. You normally would be strong enough to able to toss a woman Aaron's size around like a ragdoll, but they are driven by a strength that makes your attempts to push them away like trying to push a school bus off yourself. You try to hit them, but you can't even bring yourself to hit them that hard, and your attempts to resist only seem make Aaron's desire grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your underwear is in tatters. Your disgust has caused your manhood to go flaccid but that doesn't deter Aaron one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ecstasy is exhilarating. Matt's attempt to push or hit you just enhance that already maddening lust to greater heights. Like a treasure chest lid opening, the underwear finally gives way to your prize and you squee in delight. Matt's cock sits there like a snake, the man completely not aroused at this point but that doesn't stop you. You grab Matt's penis and begin rubbing it. \"Yes... Matt... Give it to me! <b>GIVE IT!!!</b>\" You shout in joy as the cock appears to start to erect, only to drop. The frustration just makes you more determined as you take his cock and put it into your mouth and begin tasting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only react in horror at the sight of your dick hardening as Aaron grabbed and stroked it. Aaron is barely coherent at this point, shouting with glee and demanding you get harder. \"I DON'T WANT THIS!\" You plead again, though by now you've realized Aaron can't or won't hear you, your cock finally seems to drop back down despite Aaron's stroking. Still having the cock in their hands, Aaron only takes that as a challenge and places it into their mouth. Despite your best efforts your cock begins to get harder and harder against all your will and disgust at this situation. \"MmmMMmMMMM!! Mmmm...\" you hear the moans of lustful joy as Aaron continues the unwanted blowjob. Suddenly, Aaron pulls your cock out of their mouth and for a moment sits on their hands and knees and stares at the fully erect and ready cock. If you don't do something, Aaron going to have their way with you even more than they already have. \"I need more! MORE!\" you hear Aaron shout, the teeth in the even widening smile on their face looking like fangs. You feel sick at the feeling of domination as Aaron starts to force themselves onto your lap, their pussy getting ever closer to being penetrated by your cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it would taste gross to have another man's cock in your mouth, but it's actually not half bad, and in your current state of mind it could have been the worse taste in the world and you wouldn't have noticed. The thought Matt being \"another man\" feels like the last dying twitches of your former male self as you surrender completely to your womanly desire. As you suck and move it around in your mouth the cock tortuously slowly begins to harden, and this time there's no stopping it. \"At last...\" you think as the cock reaches full hardness, you have to have it. Pulling it out of your mouth you marvel at it's size for a brief second before starting to try to straddle Matt. \"YES!\" You scream as you feel it brush your clit</span></div></div>",

You wonder for a split second what a cock would feel like. This thought excites you and horrifies you at the same time. Disgust may be a better adjective, after all you're a man, or were. It's all so confusing right now. This thought is enough to push you over the edge. \"What the fuck\", you shout as you have your first orgasm as a woman. You lay there with your thighs clamped down on your hand. You can feel the pulse of your pussy, thump, thump, against it. \"Holy fuck\", you mumble as it starts to subside. You're in complete disbelief. Your whole world has just been turned upside down. You woke up as a woman and now just minutes later have experienced your first orgasm as a woman. It was way better than you had ever imagined.    </span></div></div>",

You became aware earlier that your new body gets attention. As a man you never had to worry about being alone out in public. Woman on the other hand need to watch out for creeps. You curse yourself for not thinking of this. You were so caught up in shopping and trying on clothes you never considered it. You notice that no one else is around and the man must have had noticed it as well because he starts to close the distance. You see your car and quicken your pace as well.

You seem to move on auto-pilot. You grab his wrist, twist your body, and bend up his arm. You apply more pressure and hear a loud crack as his arm breaks. He drops the knife. Before he can even scream you land two punches to his exposed side. You feel ribs crack with each very precisely placed punch. You step away, kick out, and land a kick to his knee eliciting another loud crack.

The lab Matt got this stuff from wasn't looking to create busty bimbos, they were looking to create super soldiers. The geeks could have just changed the gender and appearance DNA leaving the rest unchanged. All the things you attributed earlier to the geeks creating a rational woman could have just been a coincidence. Rational, intelligent, emotionally stability, and such are also ideal traits for a super soldier. That combined with super fast reflexes, strength, and speed that you displayed just a little bit of go. \"Oh crap\", you mutter. You look in the mirror at the spot of blood on your throat where the man had his knife pressed. You wipe it off to reveal you do not have a wound.

You say miserable because the security was insane. You found out that they were actually a government front. You never figured out which agency and didn't even try. Matt must have stolen whatever was in the vial from them. You drop the vial and attempt to shake Matt awake to question him more. \"Matt, wake up\", you shout while shaking his shoulders. He doesn't wake up but you notice something odd, his hair is growing and changing colors. Something also seems to be growing on his chest. \"What the hell\", you mutters while feeling them. They feel strangely familiar, but you can't say why. Concerned for his well being you unbutton his shirt. What you see sends your mind reeling. All of his chest hair has vanished.

Your thoughts wonder back to Matt. You try to call him, or rather her, but get no answer. You attempt to text her with the same result. \"His problem\", you tell yourself. Matt has exceeded your weirdness threshold. To be honest having his porn star looking wife leaving him for another porn star looking girl exceeded it. The whole turning himself into his wife's girlfriend with stolen whatever from a top secret government lab took things to a whole new level. You figure it best to end your involvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sigh and mix yourself a drink in an attempt to banish the memory of last night to some hidden depths of your mind. Especially the part where Matt gave you a woody after his transformation. You have to admit that Amber picked one fine ass girl to leave him for. She had an amazing rack. You get a shiver up you spine that you got turned on by Matt. You quickly down the drink and mix another. As the sun begins you've got a pretty good buzz going.</span></div></div>",

I thought it would work.\" You laugh and say, \"Last night you were drunk of your ass.\" She tilts her head, smiles, and says, \"Now seems like a good time to repeat that. Why not fix me one of those.\" You quickly fix Matt a drink and then another. After four she states, \"Shit, I'm already fucked up. This new metabolism is great. I can get drunk faster. Aaron, I love, man.\" \"Love you to buddy. Even more now that you have that awesome body\", you laugh. Matt laughs back and says, \"It is awesome, these tits are amazing, and this ass is incredible. Here, take a look.\" With that Matt slips of the she's wearing to reveal she wasn't wearing any underwear. Make sense that she would have that many women's clothes to chose from. She slowly spins around giving you a full view of everything. \"I even shaved everything for that bitch. I wanted to look good for her. I was such an idiot. She never gave a shit about me.\" matt's show is having an affect on your body and mind. You have to remind yourself that this is Matt.

(her hand comes up to your face) You're my best friend.\" He expression changes. even though Matt has changed a great deal you recognize that look. It's the one Matt always gets when he, or rather she now is about to do something crazy. Before you can do anything she pulls herself up and plants a kiss right on you. Your buzzed mind responds by kissing her back. She repositions and straddles your lap while continuing to kiss you. She begins grinding her pussy against your rapidly hardening cock. You finally begin processing what's happening. Your rational mind screams in disgust to what your letting happen. You know where this is leading. \"This is Matt\", it yells. You have a hard time concentrating due to Matt's massive breasts pressing against your hairy chest, and you feel how wet she is against your cock. \"I want you so bad\", she moans. This only serves to further muffle the voice of reason. You know you should push her off. This is so wrong on so many levels, best friend, was a guy less than 24hours ago, drunk, and is emotionally vulnerable. </span></div></div>",

Whether it's to please you, or her just embracing her gender you don't know. However, you still do all the things together that you did with Matt and then some. She treats her body like a new toy to be played with. Her sexual appetite is off the chart. You probably shouldn't complain, but damn, you could use a break. At some point Amber snuck back over and cleaned the house out of her stuff. Jodi had to go shopping for clothes. You were a little surprised by the outfits she picked out. You didn't think she could outdo Amber in the slut category. To be fair those outfits are only for you to see. She bought other outfits that are slightly more conservative to wear in public. Jodi gave away all her male clothing except some signed jerseys and collectables to charity. She even put her house up for sale. During the past week you've been talking about her moving in with you. She practically lives at your house anyway. Even with the extreme change in her appearance you still see a lot of Matt in her. Right now you're shopping at the local mega-mart. Jokingly you hold up a box of tampons and say, \"Need some of these?\" She just shrugs and replies with, \"Nope, haven't had a period yet, thank gawd.\" You frown and ask, \"Shouldn't you have had one by now?\" Again she shrugs and says, \"I don't know. I know Amber used to get them like clockwork every month, but she was on the pill. From what I've read that keeps them regular.\" Some things race through your mind and you say, \"Oh crap, we haven't been using any birth control and been screwing like rabbits. You could be pregnant.\" \"I can't be pregnant. I'm a guy, or was a guy\", she scoffs and then frowns. You see her mind working. \"Oh crap, I have been feeling a little under the weather the past few days. Shit, I could be\", she states stunned. You search the rack for a pregnancy test and buy three. Jodi is quiet on the way home and looks a little freaked. As soon as you get home she grabs the bag with the tests and runs to the bathroom. You unload the rest of the groceries and then catch up with her. As you enter the bathroom you notice all three tests opened and sitting on the vanity.

I mean this is happening really quick\", you reply. She frowns and says, \"Aaron, we've known each other, like forever. That's not really rushing things. We enjoy being with each other and I can't think of anyone else I'd rather be with, can you?\" You can't argue with her logic. Everything she's said is right on the mark. What you feel for her is unlike anything you've ever felt for a woman. Before you know it you say, \"I would love for you to be my wife.\" She smiles and then says, \"Well, if we're going to do this I want you to do it right and propose to me like a girl should be proposed to. I don't want it done in a bathroom, so for now the answer is no.\" You feel a momentary sense of relief that she didn't want to run off and do it right now. This subsides as you know she's going to expect you to perform the whole ritual. Jodi jumps up, gives you a kiss, and rushes out of the bathroom. \"What have I done\", you think to yourself.</span></div></div>",

That thought causes you some alarm as soon as you have it. Is this what this is, shopping with the girlfriend, Matt? It seems to fit the description. He, rather she now is your best friend and you're fucking, but it's more than just sex. You care for her, Matt. You shake your head wondering what the hell is wrong with you and when this get so weird. The answer to that is when you walked in to find Matt transforming into a woman after getting injected with shit he stole from a government black experiment. You don't know whether to see where this goes, or to abandon Matt and run like hell.</span></div></div>",

I mean, I got the general look down, but the stuff I got from the lab had custom DNA coding that the nerds brewed up. They called it dream girl juice. It was their idea of the ideal woman. They kind of did it off the books and it wasn't authorized. That's why I figured even if they missed it they wouldn't report it. I figured that if I became an even better woman, better version than her girlfriend she would want me. At first she did.

Maybe, it was so we could be together\", she says. Matt then straddles you and plants a kiss on you. The taste of her causes your head to spin.

Amber and her lesbo girlfriend came in last night and stole my body.\" You look up at her bewildered. Amber has never been one to joke around and never this bazaar. \"What\", you finally reply? She rolls her eyes and says, \"Amber and her lesbo girlfriend, who happens to be a witch came in and did some kind of mumbo jumbo and put me into Amber's body. Amber took off with mine.\" Amber can see you're not convinced and starts going on about stuff you and Matt did before Matt even met. Stuff Matt swore he would never tell anybody else about.</span></div></div>",

What do you want me to do\", you state with your hungover throbbing head. \"We need to get over to my house before those two do something\", she says starting to yell again. \"No yelling and I need a shower and coffee\", you mumble rubbing your head. She huffs and says, \"Fine, I'll fix your coffee, you get a quick shower and then we go.\" You stumble to the shower while she heads for the kitchen. You watch her cute ass shake as she walks off. \"Damn, Amber has a fine ass\", you think to yourself. You step into the shower. You wash up and rub the sore spot on the back of your head.

Then in a familiar voice she whispers in your ear, \"Please, fuck me.\" It takes your groggy mind a minute to process why her voice is familiar and what's going on. She pushes down swallowing up your cock into her pussy and starts to grind. Your mind finally catches up and you become fully awake. Your eyes fly open to see Amber, or rather Matt above you. The expression on her face is a mix of pleasure, pain, and confusion. She sees you shock and begs, \"Don't stop, I need this, I need you so bad.\" </span></div></div>",

Once she discovers how inferior having sex as a man is I think Amber will be disappointed. I doubt that would be enough to get him to want to switch back. What will get to him is when he discovers I emptied the bank accounts and converted all my investments to cash and checks. I brought them over the other night, the night Amber switched us. I stashed it in your garage. I checked and it's still there. All Amber has is the $10,000 I left at the house. He doesn't have any money except the $10,000 I left at the house. He has the house up for sell, but the way the market is, good luck. I'm sure he's maxed out my credit cards already, but since Amber is me now he's responsible for the bill. Seeing that Amber has nothing but a degree in elementary education which he's never used. Not to mention that's Amber's degree, and I'm Amber now. I don't think he'll be able to afford to pay those bills. I'm sure the change in gender hasn't made that gold digging bitch any cheaper to live with. I think Amber will be coming back in time and begging me to change back. In the meantime you help me with the other part of the curse so I can think straight.\" You raise an eyebrow and say, \"Help you?\" Matt smiles and says, \"By fucking me as much as can. You can't tell me you didn't enjoy it. Remember, you told me once you would love to fuck Amber. Well, you got your wish. I'll be your little slut until he comes back. Don't feel like you're taking advantage of me or anything. After last night I'd let you fuck my tight little pussy even if I weren't cursed. It felt so good.\" As she's talking she moves closer to you. Before you know it your cock is rock hard again. \"Change you mind\", she purrs grabbing your shaft.</span></div></div>",

You've been fucking it for the last few months. Somehow, even though it can't be, you have Jenny's body. You go to move your hands, but find that they're retrained.

He fakes a confused look and replies with, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you wanted her body, At least that's what you told her on the phone. Well you got it buddy. You're now Jenny, my loving wife.\" The look in Nick's eye scares you. \"Look Nick, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to happen\", you start to plead. He cuts you off by pulling out his phone and pressing something. Suddenly your whole body is in pain. You try to scream, but it comes out like a whimper. \"That's your first lesson. There will be no begging to change you back. You will refer to me as honey, baby, master, or any other cute pet name I think of. You will never refer to me as Aaron did. You are not him anymore. You're my slutty little trophy wife that will do whatever I say. If you don't you will experience the most excruciating pain. That was just level 1. It goes up to 20. I can also make you feel really good if you do the right thing\", he says coldly and calmly. He then does something with his phone again. Suddenly you feel a rush of pleasure rush through your new body. Your nipples become hard as diamonds and you get wet between the legs. You feel horny as hell and in need of satisfaction. \"That's level 2, it also goes up to 20. You want to feel more don't you\", he says with a smirk. He whips out his cock and says, \"Suck it and I'll make you feel even better\". You loved that feeling, but there is no way you're sucking Nick's cock. You hesitate and he uses his phone again.</span></div></div>",

You two had been through all the ups and down of multiple relationships together. While you were currently single Phil\u2019s girlfriend of almost three years just dumped him on the eve of their anniversary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had this whole dinner planned and everything. Followed by a romantic and boat ride on the lake then....\u201d Phil sighed as he pulled out a small box and showed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were going to propose?\u201d You asked as you took the box. Inside was a beautiful diamond ring, one any girl would be lucky to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...I really thought she was the one. I guess she felt differently...She told me we had been growing apart recently but I could tell something was off...She was hiding something.\u201d Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think she was hiding?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s somebody else. From her tone I could tell. What\u2019s worse is I think it\u2019s someone I know....\u201d Phil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho...who do think it is?\u201d You said with a strangely quiet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for your awkward behavior was all to obvious to you. For you knew the real reason Phil\u2019s girlfriend Sarah left him....It was because of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never meant for anything to happen. You came over to Phil\u2019s apartment one morning to help carry out some old furniture. The door was open so you let yourself in. Like you had done plenty of times. Phil wasn\u2019t there when you arrived but someone was there. Sarah was there and had just gotten out of the shower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that day far too clear. Sarah stepped out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel and the two of you saw each other and froze. There was a slight awkwardness and pause before it happened....That damn smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah saw you and slowly smiled and bit her lip seductively. She was very sexy. Long blonde hair, big boobs and nice curves. You always had a secret crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it one thing led to another and...Well...The rest is history. It was quick but amazing. Phil actually almost walked in on you two. You had never felt so guilty in all your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swore to yourself it was a mistake. A one time error in judgement and never to do it again....However that was a promise you couldn\u2019t keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah kept texting and messaging you on social media. Pretty soon one hook up began to turn into several while Phil was out at work. This went on for about a month before she called things off with Phil last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry man it\u2019s a beautiful ring. Are you going to return it?\u201d You asked Phil looking at the Golden band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...that\u2019s a very special ring. It actually expands or shrinks to fit the owner check it out...\u201d Phil said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How is that possible?\u201d You asked taking the ring out of the box. You moved it to your finger and sure enough it expanded just wide enough for you to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that is amazing!\u201d You said looking at the ring as you wore it as a joke for your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...It is....You what else is amazing....How you betray me like this....\u201d Phil said with a cold tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words hit you like ice cold water....He knew....Sarah must have told him.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...Phil...before you....\u201d You began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey....don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m about to get a new girlfriend soon anyway.\u201d Phil said with a weird smile and tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...okay....Umm...how do you take this thing off?\u201d You asked pulling on the ring but it wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh there is a special trick to it. I will show you soon, why don\u2019t we meet here again tomorrow. I\u2019m sure we will have much to discuss.\u201d Phil said before he turned and left you alone there at the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit this was one of the strangest nights ever. You had this dumb ring stuck to you and your best friend didn\u2019t care you just ruined his relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading home you got back to your apartment as you climbed in bed not noticing the ring on your bed was beginning to glow. </span></div></div>",

Rachel had called and asked me to come over, and said it was serious. How could I say no? Rachel and I had grown up living next door to each other our entire lives. We played together as babies. We became fast friends as children. Each of us had more than our share of teasing in elementary school. We even tried a brief romance in eight grade, but we both quickly realized that we were meant to be friends, not lovers. That only deepened out friendship though. Each of us knew the other so well that we usually knew what the other was thinking, and sometime even finished each other's sentences. When she started dating another friend of mine, Ed, I thought it was great. He is a nice guy and one of the few men I thought worthy of dating my best friend. So, even if Ed saw me here, I doubt he would have thought anything of it. Still, they were due to get married a week from now. I didn't like the idea of what people might think if they saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the door opened and Rachel let me in, \"Oh Ken! Than you for coming. I know you don't like this, but trust me, this was the best time!\" I felt better when she closed the door though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her. She was petite, long chestnut hair, and a slight build that was somewhere between athletic and hour-glass. In my opinion, her body was perfect. \"No problem Rachel, but what is so important that it couldn't wait until tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at me, and I could see she had been crying, \"I can't do it Ken! I can't go through with the whole wedding thing! You know me! Ed's parents are supposed to fly in tomorrow. I will be meeting them for the first time. I know I will screw up! And his sister! I only met her once! And all that extended family, the rehearsal, the big wedding, the reception. I can't face all of those people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took her hand, \"Rachel. You can do it. You love Ed. Right?\" She nodded. \"You are going to be spending your life with him. In total, you just have to put up with a few hours compared to years of marriage. You can do that for Ed.\" I paused, \"Or.... ask him to elope.\" I squeezed her hand, \"He loves you. I am sure that he would do it if it meant a lot to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"I know, but it is more than that. He got off of the phone with his mom yesterday. It seems that he is giving in to pressure from her to have children right away. She wants grandchildren. I don't know if I am ready for that. I wanted to spend at least a couple of years before we took that step. Time to get to know Ed better, and he get to know me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled, \"Well, you have more say in that than his mother! Don't worry! Ed is cool. I am sure he will understand when you explain it to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"I just can't do it Ken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"Rachel. You know I will do anything to help you. You and Ed are perfect for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Do you really mean that? Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, \"You know that I am a man of my word more than anybody Squirt!\" She didn't always like my nickname for her. She was sometimes self-conscious about how short she was, but she knew it came with love behind it from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"Then how would you like to spend the next week being a 'woman of your word'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had me confused, \"What do you mean by that?\" I thought, \"I am not going to dress up as a girl for you Rachel. That...\" I saw her smirk, \"That isn't what you mean. Okay. I am listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed me to rings, \"These are magic rings. If one person is wearing one, and someone puts the other one on, they will swap bodies. More than that, they retain key knowledge, like how to apply makeup, or do hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at her until it sank in, \"You want me to...\" I looked at her small body differently now, \"You can't be serious. I mean. There is no such thing as magic anyhow.\" Her stare was constant, \"Okay, how would that help? Even if it worked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"You know me like a book Ken. You would have no trouble acting like me. There is nobody who knows me better, so you wouldn't get stumped by any questions. Unlike me, you are good around people. You could take my place for the next week. After the wedding, we will find a moment alone and swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at her a long time, \"You really are serious! You want met to swap bodies with you?\" I could see the look in her eyes and answered before she did, \"Yes, you are. But what about Ed. Even if this is possible, does he know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked panicked! \"No! No! He can't. He wouldn't understand. You do, but he wouldn't. He can never know!\" She almost begged, \"Please Ken! It would just be for a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"Well, I think whoever sold those rings to you stole your money, but I will make you this deal, if they actually work, I promise to be a 'woman of my word' and go through with everything for you.\" Poor Rachel. She was going to be so disappointed when it didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed and hugged me! \"Thanks Ken! You are the greatest friend on earth!\" She took one ring and put it on her finger. Then handed the other to me, \"Here. I want you to be the one to initiate the swap. If you changed you mind, just hand it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chucked, \"Sure.\" I slipped the ring on. Suddenly, my world exploded, and I felt like I was being sucked out of my body! It was like flying down a tunnel, and then running into a soft barrier, which gave way and let me through. Then things began to return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost normal. When my feeling started to return, things in my body were feeling very odd. I couldn't understand why. Then my vision cleared, and soon I could see normally, only what I saw my my face smiling down at me. MY face! From the outside! I looked down at myself, and I saw breasts, and long brown hair hanging over my shoulders! I was in Rachel's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body, which now towered over me, smiled and clapped and then hugged me, \"It worked! Oh thank you Ken! Or I guess I should call you Rachel now. We should get used to the names for our bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it. It actually worked! I was a woman! A woman engaged to my other friend! I looked up at, well, 'him' and said, \"...</span></div></div>",

And for a week? Think about it Squirt. We might know each other better than any friends in the world, but there are, um, 'things' that are still private. If we go through with this there will be literally nothing we don't know, or have seen, of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled, \"Well, for one thing, I just want to point out that 'you' are the Squirt now.\" He chuckled, \"And yes, I have thought about that. I won't even get jealous when you kiss Ed. In fact, feel free to enjoy it. You will need for that to be natural after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stunned. That is right. I would have to kiss Ed! \"Oh! I hadn't thought of that. I guess I will need to get very used to this body.\" I blushed, \"And the idea of kissing Ed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled, \"Well, I better go and give you time to explore. Feel free to, um, touch. I have a few things about the male anatomy that I am curious about myself.\" He mussed my hair, \"See you at work on Monday Squirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, I just said, \"Ha. Ha.\" It was good that each of use had done the other's jobs over the time we worked there. I would be able to step right in at Rachel's desk. But before that, I had to 'meet' Ed's family as Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, I was along in her place. Well, I guess it was my place for now. I walked over to a mirror, and it was strange to see Rachel staring back. I reached up and squeezed the breasts I was now sporting. It was strange to feel then, and also to feel my hands squeezing them. I blushed when I looked down at my crotch. I both wanted to look and feel there, but at the same time I felt like I would be sneaking a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe debate ended when I realized that I needed to pee. It was awkward realizing that I needed to sit down to pee now, but there was no question about 'seeing' things. Or touching, since I learned why girls need to wipe. I was both strange, and oddly thrilling, to be female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the rest of the night exploring the bedroom. Closets, drawers, intimate things I never would have considered looking for until now. I was a little bit surprised by some of the things that I found!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was exhausted when I finally got ready for bed. I had a big day coming tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

I asked her why she didn't tell me sooner, we could have saved our relationship. But she just looked at me and told me she couldn't tell me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible to hear.\" You reply. \"Where is she now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where, probably with that guy of hers. I couldn't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayla...\" You just don't know what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buggers, I want my girlfriend back.\" Kayla mutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't convince someone to like you Kayla, you should let it sink in for a few days and then talk things through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting her get away with that.\" Kayla tells you as she runs off to her bedroom. You follow her inside. Lisa's side of the wardrobe is open and everything except for a few clothes are gone. Kayla is searching for something underneath her bed. \"I know I have it somewhere. Here!\" Kayla pulls out a small chest. She opens it and you can see it contains a few documents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is perfect. Now don't you move, I want to try something.\" Kayla grabs a document and she suddenly chants in an unknown language. It feels wrong, like your body knows the language but your mind can't comprehend it. Your feet are stuck to the ground and you can't move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens...</span></div></div>",

You hear some strange music as your eyes close. It's like you're falling. Falling slowly into an abyss of black. \"To save a life a man must do, what a woman needs to!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The d\u00e9cor of the small caf\u00e9 Rachel sat in was, to put it kindly, dated. Not dated in the way that, with a minimal effort, it could have the trendy retro look that so many shops current shops were embracing. No, the owners clung to the dingy and dated d\u00e9cor not out of a sense of pride or fashion or what the new look is, but because a long string of indifferent owners had decided their idea of redecorating had stopped at changing the sign hanging on the door. Not that Rachel was there for the D\u00e9cor. She wasn\u2019t even there for the coffee, which in spite of the aged look of the machines behind the counter was actually quite decent. Actually, the place was warm, and smelled of good coffee and bakery products. On any other day the tiny booth she sat in, with it\u2019s view of the rain splattered street, would have been a perfectly wonderful place to hole up and waste the day by drinking coffee and watching the few pedestrians brave enough to chance the rain that fell in fitful bursts. <br>\r\n  Maybe, she thought, depending on how the day played out, she would come back. She could certainly see herself becoming fond of the place. But first, she had to get through today. Today was a day of reconciliation. A day for tallying up old hurts, and settling accounts. Of healing, or at least closure. A day when she finally got together enough courage to change the course of a life that had been dragging her down the last 6 months. A day for wiping the ledger clean. At this thought Rachel snorted, then coughed. The sip of coffee she had just inadvisable taken stinging the inside of her nose. <br>\r\n  She wasn\u2019t sure she was ready for this. But what she was sure of was that she\u2019d had enough. She couldn\u2019t keep living, not like this. Not avoiding all contact with those responsible for where she was. So she\u2019d taken the first step. It had taken her two days to get up the nerve to make that call. In the end she had, savagely punching the numbers into the payphone before she could change her mind. Fortunately, Ray had picked up. If the call had gone to voicemail Rachel was sure she would have hung up. Lost her nerve. And ran. Again.<br>\r\n  She still wanted to run, but forced herself to sit. To wait. Ray had said he would be right over. It was too late for second guessing herself. One way or another she was going to deal with this. There is something to be said for inertia, and now that the ball was rolling all she needed to do was hang tight and things had no choice but to change. And change was what she needed.<br>\r\n  A chair scraped beside her, pulling her out of herself. Glancing in the window she took a sharp breath when she saw the reflection of who had sat down. One of the last people she wanted to deal with right now. And the very person she had arranged to meet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Rachel\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cHello Ray\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, Just hello? No hug or \u2018it\u2019s good to see you\u2019\u201d?<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting very hard right now to not to throw this coffee in your face, so don\u2019t push it\u201d! <br>\r\n\u201cOuch, that\u2019s hostile. And yet you\u2019re the one who wanted to see me. I\u2019m getting mixed messages here\u201d.<br>\r\n  She turned and stared straight into his eyes, hostility clear in her voice. \u201cYou want a clear message. Fine, here it is. I hate you. I hate all of you. Get out of my life and stop trying to contact me.\u201d She turned angrily back to the window.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you mean that\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could be any clearer\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. First off,\u201d Ray ticked the points of on his fingers, \u201cnone of us have tried to contact you, not since your phone went dead. Secondly, you\u2019re the one who contacted us.

That's it? Or are you going to call again in another six months? Ray pushed the table back into place but he didn't make a move to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flame that had been smoldering in Rachel's chest roared into life. She spun around and marched back towards Ray. She spoke in a low and seething whisper. \"That's\u2014You're mad at me? You're mad at me? You stole my life. Your bitch of a sister betrayed me. If she\u2014I came here for closure. Yes, I missed having people in my life who cared about me, but that's not you, that's not\u2014Kayla. I have no friends. I have no family.

Her eyes were red and tears were welling up inside them. Ray had the decency to look worried and maybe there was some shame mixed in. Since Rachel had been so busy avoiding and ignoring his old friends they never had a chance to learn how she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I don't know how to play the game women play. I don't know if I can put up with the men trying to have sex with me.

Stupid, stupid, stupid. <br>\r\n  Her grand plan to change things had gone wrong. There had always been the chance that it might, of course. But she\u2019d vastly underestimated. She\u2019d thought she would be over the anger. That by denying it the anger would go away. Then, when she was sure it was gone, two minutes of conversation had blown a hole in the wall she\u2019d spent the last six months building. Six months denying she was now a creature ruled by emotions. Six months living an existence devoid of colour, denying the reds, the greens, the blues of emotion. Six months instead embracing the grey of not feeling. Two minutes in, and six months of denied emotion; rage, hate. disgust, resentment, had burst forth, hot as ever. Blindly she stumbled along, her thoughts consumed by the whirl of all the colours she wasn't used to. All tinting one echoing word. Stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid to think she was over it. Stupid to think she could have anything to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow she\u2019d blindly made her way up 10th street in  her anger, and now stood at the midpoint of the bridge. She had been walking quickly in her rage, and now her body faltered, unused to such exertion. She clutched a lamp post for support, just to rest for a moment, breathing heavily. The bubbling turmoil of thoughts and emotions slowly died away, and left her with an aching hollowness. By reflex, she tried to reach the blank emotionless state she\u2019d trained herself to live in, but it wouldn\u2019t come. A great welling of sadness and despair welled up instead, and tears began again to flow freely down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As the heat of emotion drained she began to feel chilled. She blinked away her tears, finally focusing on the world around her. Her clothes were soaked She\u2019d left her coat in the caf\u00e9, and the rain had soaked through the thin material of her blouse. Probably within moments of her leaving. Funny how she hadn\u2019t noticed it until now. Funny how she\u2019d wound up here, of all places. When she started the day she was looking for closure. Now here she was, clutching a lamp post at the top of a bridge, freezing and staring at the dark water churning below.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wouldn\u2019t look directly at him though; instead she stared at his reflection in the window.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cLook, just come and talk to them\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWe have nothing to talk about\u201d. She spat.<br>\r\nThe words stung even as she spoke. It was a lie. They both knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of silence passed, and then Ray spoke again, trying a different tactic.<br>\r\n  \u201cYou\u2019re killing her\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cGood. Fair is fair\u201d. The lack of tone in her own voice surprised her, as if she didn\u2019t care. She had cared. Too much in those early days, when her anger was hot and she had furiously swore to have nothing to do with any of them ever again. For weeks she fanned the coals of fury when ever they died down until the flames had burned white hot once again. But she had never been one for holding onto anger, she\u2019d never had to, in her old life, and too soon the righteous fire of indignation had burned away, leaving only the cold ashes of regret. By that time she\u2019d moved out of the apartment. And gotten into the habit of avoiding all the places they used to hang out. She stopped answering her phone, letting the voicemail take it until there was no room left, and then eventually letting the contract lapse until it had been disconnected. She told herself she didn\u2019t care. The problem was, she still did. She could only lie to herself for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cShe misses you. We all miss you\u201d.<br>\r\n  And there it was. In truth, she missed them as well, probably as much if not more. She missed the good times. She missed the easy comradely they had shared. She missed just having someone to talk to who wasn\u2019t trying to sell her something, or get into her pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat, staring at the drizzle running down the window, not really seeing the wet street in front of her. Abruptly, she turned and looked at the man sitting beside her. The cold window reflection really didn\u2019t do the real thing justice. The shock of reddish coloured hair. The deep blue eyes. The firm chin. The wry grin. It was a look she had intentionally cultivated; one that used to drive the girls crazy, a lifetime ago. The new Ray wore the look as naturally as if he\u2019d been born with it, instead of having it foisted on him. Still, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to resent how he looked. It wasn\u2019t his fault. It was Kayla\u2019s. No, that wasn\u2019t right either. Blaming Kayla was more from habit at this point, a habit born of that part of her anger had burned out long ago, leaving only the ghosts of words that no longer had any substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay looked into her eyes, a serious expression on his face. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing. Is it to punish her? It\u2019s wrong. You\u2019re punishing yourself to punish her and that\u2019s wrong\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  With a start she realized what he\u2019d said was true. Sure she\u2019d been hurt and betrayed, but she\u2019d pushed it over the top. In her old life she had hated drama queens, and then went full melodrama at the first opportunity. It was time to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Still she denied it, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to punish her\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Ray was not convinced. \u201cAre you sure? Are you sure you\u2019re not hurting yourself because you know how much it would hurt her? Don\u2019t you realize that nothing you do will hurt her anymore than she already hurts herself\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cI doubt that\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? \u2018Cause if you\u2019re interested you might like to know we\u2019ve spent the last 6 months wondering where you were, what you were doing, if you were okay. There are nights she\u2019s cried herself to sleep over what she\u2019s done to you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cAnd of course you haven\u2019t\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cI\u2019m a man now. I\u2019m not supposed to cry. But when I hear her sometimes I do. And it hasn\u2019t made things better\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cDoes it matter? We can\u2019t go back\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYour right about that. We can never go back to what we were.

For some reason she couldn\u2019t identify she wanted him to think he was talking her into this, something she had already decided she was going to do. Where had that come from?<br>\r\nRay scooped both her hands up from the table, clasping them in his as if the two of them where deep in prayer. You can. You must! He said feverishly. If only to let her know you\u2019re still alive. <br>\r\n  \u201cOkay\u201d. She stood up \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Let\u2019s go\u201d.<br>\r\n  \u201cWhat? Just like that\u201d? he asked, shocked at the suddenness of her decision.<br>\r\n  \u201cYes\u201d, she said, gathering the meager belongings she had with her. \u201cbefore I change my mind\u201d.<br>\r\n  They left the shop at that, walking the short distance to the train station in silence. Not to much later they had boarded the train back to the rented house Ray now shared with the other two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The train ride was nerve racking. Her courage, so strong in the coffee shop, faltered Several times she almost decided not to go through with it, to get off at the next stop. But each time she hesitated, and each time the moment of opportunity passed. <br>\r\n  She wasn\u2019t familiar with the neighborhood, and the walk from the train station to the front door seemed to take forever, and yet oddly no time at all. At last they stood on the porch while he fumbled out the key, her heart beating so fast she was sure she would pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first Ray just stood there in shock. The giggling was infectious, and after a moment he to started to laugh, which made her laugh. The relief of tension the empty house provided proved to lighten the mood, the first lightheartedness either of them had felt in a long while. Acting on the moment he took on the role of the gracious host and played it to the hilt, showing her around the small house and outrageously embellishing it\u2019s features like it was an episode of \u2018Cribs\u2019. Before she realized it they were talking about anything, and everything, just like old friends again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The afternoon flew passed, and they only realized it when the growl of someone\u2019s stomach let them know it was way passed diner time. Together they whipped up a simple dinner, spaghetti with a tomato mushroom sauce and a bottle of red wine.<br>\r\n After dinner and a quick wash up, they took the wine and moved to the living room, sipping and continuing to chat until the bottle was finished. Ray was just about to suggest they open another when they heard the door of the house open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cRay\u201d? came Kayla\u2019s voice. \u201cAre you here\u201d?<br>\r\n  \u201cIn the living room\u201d Ray called back, then put one finger to his lips and winked at Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhggh, you won\u2019t believe the day I\u2019ve had.\u201d Kayla complained her way down the hall. \u201cI swear if that Jackass of a district manager they hired says one more thing to me about how\u2026\u201d She came around the corner and froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Rachel stood up, although she would be hard pressed to say if it was out of politeness, or in preparation to flee. At the sound of Kayla\u2019s voice all the anxiety Rachel felt had come flooding back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cHey Kayla\u201d Ray said brightly \u201cYou remember Rachel, don\u2019t you\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  For a long moment the words hung in the air, then, in a sudden flurry of movement, Kayla rushed at Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cRachel? Rachel! Oh my God!  It is you! It really is you!  Oh my God\"!<br>\r\n  The shear savagery of the hug Kayla inflicted knocked Rachel off balance, and she nearly fell back onto the couch. <br>\r\n  I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you! Your really here. What are you doing here? Where have you been? Are you okay? What made you come back? What have you been doing\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cEasy there Kayla\u201d Ray laughed, pulling Kayla back a bit so Rachel could catch her balance. \u201cFirst you need to stop squeezing her so hard so she can answer\u201d. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or was it literally a small mansion, since the grounds were surrounded by a high wall, with gates at the entrances, and immaculately kept grounds? Yeah. When a servant answered the door, that pretty much ended that debate. This was the home of your old high-school buddy, Brock, who had been involved in some kind of internet startup while he was in college, and just like that, he was super rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impressive to see the place, but you had to wonder what Brock wanted with you? You were a mechanic, so you were sure that there was nothing you could do to help him in his kind of business. Wait! Maybe he had a fleet of cars and wanted to hire his old friend as the guy to maintain them? That would be so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were waiting in the large foyer when you saw Amanda walking toward you. Amanda was Brock's beautiful wife. You had not seen her since the wedding of course, but she looked as great as always. She was short, with average breasts, but on her slim body, and with her face and beautiful, long, chestnut hair going down to her waist, she looked incredible as always. Her heels clicked loudly on the marble floor, and she looked sexy as the skirt of the blue dress she was wearing swished around her legs. She smiled up at you, \"Ken! I can't tell you how wonderful it is to see you again!\" She shook your hand firmly... for a girl. \"Brock will was delayed, but let's wait for him out bye the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her, \"Good to see you again Amanda. Lead on!\" Even though she was Brock's wife, you couldn't resist watching her cut, tight, butt wiggle as she walked in front of you. You considered Brock lucky in many things, not the least of which was the perfect proportions of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you chatted while you waited for Brock. Amanda smiled at you, \"Still nobody in your life Ken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, \"No. I guess that I am just too picky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Nothing wrong with that. If I recall what Brock said correctly, part of your problem is finding a girl who wants a big family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit sheepish talking about this with a woman, \"Yeah, well, most women want careers now. They don't want big families, if any. I just love kids though, and I think it would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Yeah. Easy for a guy to say when his wife is the one who has to go through the whole pregnancy and childbirth thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Yeah, so I hear. And hear, and hear, and hear.\" You try to defend yourself, \"But I would be a good husband and father! I would take care of her. I swear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"What if you could be the one to have the babies, and be taken care of? Would you still be anxious for a big family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, \"Sure! I would still love children. And I like the sound of being taken care of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Well, you could have that chance.\"</span></div></div>",

Great to see you again! I miss the fun times we had you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"Me too.\" Then you frowned, \"Um, Amanda asked me lots of questions about me wanting children, and said something cryptic about a deal or something. What's up?\" Then you thought of something, \"Oh! Wait! Dude, if this is about something like, you can't father children and you want me to be some kind of surrogate, I can't do that bro. I love you as a friend, but, well, I want my kids to be my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock laughed, \"No! Nothing like that! But I am glad to here the last part of what you said!\" He sat down and looked serious, \"One reason that you and I always got along so well was that we both hate beating around the bush, so I will get to it. First, an explanation. You see, while Amanda and I love each other, we have come to a major problem in our marriage. I admit, I should have asked her before we married, but...\" He sighed, \"You see, I want a family, but Amanda doesn't want to get pregnant. Not even once. She doesn't want to be a mother, ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"Wow! Sorry about that dude. That is why I haven't found anyone yet. I ask that question too soon. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"I know. That is why you are here.\" He saw the puzzled look on your face, \"I know, but hang with me a while yet. This gets tricky.\" He paused, \"You know I always loved history and stuff. Since I have made so much money, I have been able to collect all kinds of things. A few months ago, I came across something unique, and discovered something inside of an old item that I bought that I don't think the seller knew was there. In fact, I think it has been lost for centuries. Perhaps millennia.\" He had you interest now. \"It is a book of spells. Real magic Ken! I tried some, and it works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned, \"Really! Wow! You are so lucky Brock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Well, thanks to one of the spells, you could share in my luck, if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he really had your interest, \"Really? How is that? Can you make me a partner or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"In a manner of speaking, yes.You see Ken, one of the spells in a body swap spell. What I am offering is for you to become my wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at him. You would have laughed, but his face told you it was no joke. Now Amanda's questions, and her final comment, made more sense. \"Um, if I didn't know you as well as I do, I would think you were pranking me.\" You took a deep breath, \"If this is possible, why would you want me? Why not another female who would want to have children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock grinned, \"Good questions Ken. First, think about it. Think about how hard it is just to find a girl who wants a family in the first place. We could be searching for years with no luck. And then, when we found one, would she be someone who I really would want to be married to? Would she make a good mother? Care for the children? Or would she use me and take my money?\" He leaned front, \"I know you Ken. You never agree to anything without following through. Not only that, but I know we are compatible. I know you longer than I knew Amanda before I asked her to marry me. Far longer. If you swapped with her, I know we could make it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was spinning with these thoughts, \"Um, okay. I can see you logic there, but what about Amanda? Why would she give up being a rich, sexy female to become a normal guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock shrugged, \"I won't tell you I fully understand, but she does.She like the idea of becoming a male, and thinks that your body would do very well. That, and if you go through with it, I will make sure to set him up with a business that will make things smoother to transition into that life.\" He waved, \"All of this could be yours Ken. You could be a very wealthy woman. But if you don't want that, no hard feelings, and all I would ask is for you to keep my secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was incredible! But the idea of being a female, of losing your manhood, was no small matter. On the other hand, being wealthy would sure make having a pussy a lot easier! \"Um, if I agree, would there be, like, a trial period? Could I take her body for a test drive and see how it goes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock laughed, \"I like the way you put that Ken! Unfortunately, no. It doesn't work that way. It is a one-way swap, and it would be permanent. In fact. Neither of you could ever be swapped again, with anyone. At least, that is how the translation comes out. Based on my other experiments, I believe it is right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, if you agreed, you would be Amanda for the rest of your life. This made the question that she had asked you much more serious. Given the chance, would you really be willing to be a mother? To go through pregnancy and child-birth? You would be wealthy. Would that make up for it? In spite of your fears, it was tempting. You really did want children, and here was a way to assure that you did, if from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Brock, \"If I agreed, would you respect me? I mean, a guy who gave up his manhood to have babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock looked hopeful! If you hadn't freaked out, there was hope that you would do it! \"Respect you? I would love you for it!\" He actually laid a hand on yours as if you were already his wife, \"And I promise, you would have the best of everything!\" He waved, and Amanda came walking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"Wow! I am actually surprised! I never thought you would seriously consider it, but if Brock waved me over, that means that you are. Will you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her body. What would it be like to have that incredible body AND be wealthy beyond your dreams? You growled, \"Oh hell! Why not? Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both grinned and led you to a room, and inside of that, was a secret room that had top-end biometric security. Only Brock or Amanda could open it. When inside, Brock took a book, \"Last chance to back out Ken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your focus on Amanda's beautiful body, \"Do it before I can change my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock read something and soon your head started spinning. Then you blacked out!</span></div></div>",

Then, as you began to come to your senses, you remembered. The room, Brock, Amanda, the spell. Wait! If that worked... your eyes shot open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see that you were still in what you thought of as Brock's safe-room. You just focused on your breathing for a moment, but it was soon obvious that there was a weight on your chest that was unfamiliar. As you focused on that, you could feel the straps and cups of a bra around your chest. You gasped, then whispered, \"Oh my god! It worked!\" And both the gasp and your voice sounded feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male voice next to you said, \"Yes, it did my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Brock's voice. And did he just call you 'my dear'? As you started to sit up, he helped you. You had been laying on couch in the safe-room. As you sat up, you could feel your breasts shifting. You smoothed the skirt covering your legs and crossed your legs. You looked up at Brock, then around the room, \"I don't see Amanda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock smiled, \"No, but I do.\" Then he said, \"You mean you don't see Ken. You are Amanda now. I realize that that might take some getting used to though.\" He chuckled, \"Ken woke up long before you. I guess you kept that body in good shape, because he recovered quickly. He went home to start exploring his new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the absence between your legs. You were missing something that you had been used to for your whole life, but now it wasn't there.Not that your crotch was empty. There were new and different sensations from 'down there'. You didn't miss the male references to Ken/Amanda., you voiced your first thought, \"Well, it actually worked. I mostly doubted it would, but now what? Where do we go from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went to stand up, Brock gave you a hand. It was a bit of a shock when you were fully standing, but Brock towered over you. Of course, you were not only just over five-feet tall, compared to Brock's six-feet two-inches. It was very intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock smiled at you, \"Now we get you used to being Amanda. Bye the way, in private, I have always addressed you as Mandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps, and even though you were wearing heels, you found yourself waling normally. Well, for a girl. \"I seem to know how to walk anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled, \"You will find you know how to do a lot of things that the body remembers. You will naturally sit, stand, walk, even talk like Mandy. You should also find that you know how to do makeup, your hair, and even possibly some fashion sense. The spell works that way. But don't worry, you won't lose track of who you are. It won't replace memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Well, like I said before. now what?

And I know that men can't wait too long.\" You gave him a wry smile. \"I am curious about that part myself, but yeah, it would be good to have a couple of days to 'settle in' so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock chuckled, \"I am glad that you are curious about that. I do have a thought though. Why don't we fly down to Key West and take the yacht to the Caribbean for a couple of weeks. The captain and crew have never met Mandy, so you won't need to feel any pressure about not acting right. It is very relaxing too.

It must have been instinct that caused you to reach up and wrap your arms around his neck  You closed your eyes as he bent down and just let it happen. As your lips met, it shocked you at first, but it did feel good, and before you knew it, you were kissing him back! The kiss began to get passionate, and you felt an odd tingle in your crotch. This scared you, and you broke the kiss, being afraid of where it seemed to be leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock smiled down at you, \"Thank you Mandy. Both for the kiss, and consenting to be my wife.\" He caressed your cheek, which also felt good to you, \"I will go make arrangements for our trip, but first, let me show you to our bedroom. You might want to do some exploring of your own there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw him turn red right after he said that. You knew that he had meant clothing and such. Getting to know the place. But it could also be taken as exploring your body. You actually found his reaction 'cute'. You giggled and said, \"Well, that might not be a bad idea. Remember not to come in if there is a sock on the doorknob!\" You both laughed, and your new, melodic and feminine laugh was strange in your ears, but not unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took your hand and gently led you through the halls. This place was going to be a challenge to learn where things are! Your smallness and the size of the place made you feel like a freshman on his, um, her, first day of high school, getting lost in the new, huge building. Finally, you arrived at some double doors, and Brock opened it to let you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at you, \"Now I will go to make the plans. I have things to do, so you have the rest of the morning to yourself. I will stop bye at noon to take you to lunch.\" You caught you off guard when he leaned over and kissed you lightly on the lips.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Brock left, you turned to the room. You did explore some, but it felt odd for a number of reasons. Even though this was your home and your room now, you felt like you were sneaking around and spying on Brock and Amanda. In looking through the closets, you remembered that Amanda always dressed in very feminine ways. All the clothing reflected that, especially in that most of the choices you had were now dresses and skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt very odd to go through drawers and find Brock's underwear. However, while that brought a small blush to your face, it was not as much as when you found Amanda's, well, now your, lingerie. The sheer bra's and panties that she seemed to favor would have thrilled you to see her wearing. Now you would be wearing them to thrill Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the panties in particular brought to you mind just how different things were now in the area that they covered. You walked over to the mirror on the wall and saw the beautiful form of Amanda. It was still hard to mentally connect.that beautiful woman in the mirror with being your reflection. But as you moved, so did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but at last you got up the courage to begin to unbutton the front of the dress you were wearing. Soon, you had kicked off your heels, and removed the dress. It was incredible to see Amanda standing there in her underwear. You moved a hand up and massaged a breast. It felt good, but it was so strange to not only feel that breast with your hand, but also feel the hand touching it! You reached behind your back and found yourself very adept at removing your bra. As you removed the bra, you quickly felt your breasts sag slightly as gravity pulled them down. It was a very different sensation indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your eyes settled on the flatness of your crotch. Of all the things that differentiated men from women, it was there. You would never again see the bulge that you had been used to. Well, not on yourself at least.You pulled the panties down, letting them slide down your legs and then stepping out of them as you looked in the mirror. You recognized that seeing Amanda's naked body was stunning. There, in the clear gap between your legs, was Amanda's pussy. That would soon be the focus of Brock's interest. But you were bothered. Even as you looked at that beautiful, naked body, the only time you felt the least stir of excitement is when you thought of Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the edge of the bed, you spread your legs and looked down. Through the neatly trimmed pubic bush you could see the slit that was to be expected. With your fingers, you spread the lips of your pussy apart, exposing the entrance to you vagina. A chill ran up your spin as you thought, \"That is my pussy now.\" You mind went to the fact that you wanted to have children. What that meant to you was that, now, that small hole had to receive Brock's penis. And when his seed was planted deep inside of you, if it did it's job, a child would begin to grow. You realized how scared you felt when thinking about the fact that that child would have to pass out through that tiny hole! You didn't want to dwell on that thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still bothered that, here you were, not only looking at, but touching Amanda's pussy, and it did nothing to excite you. You decided to try an experiment. You closed your eyes, and tried to imagine Brock next to you. Then you ran a finger along your pussy lips, and imagined that it was Brock touching you. The sexual thrill that hit you was so intense that it made you gasp! So there was no doubt in your mind but that you were now a normal, heterosexual woman! You repeated it and were again rewarded with that sexual thrill! Soon you thought of having sex with Brock as you lay back and played with your breasts with one hand and your pussy with the other. After a long time, you had an incredible orgasm! Waves of pleasure passed through your body, causing you to moan and arch your back! Only after it had subsided did you have the mental capacity to wonder if this is what Amanda always felt, or if it was a result of some part of the spell? In the end, you didn't care. Not as long as you continued to feel that way. It made you look forward to your honeymoon with Brock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had recovered enough, you washed up, freshened your makeup, and occupied yourself with trying on different clothing until Brock came back.</span></div></div>",
