Well time to get up and go rule your own domain. <br>\r\nYou get out of bed, take a shower, brush your teeth, and put on your usual 'hoodlum'<br>\r\nclothing as your mom calls it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hop down the stairs and grab some bacon, eggs, and waffles then start eating your breakfast. Your mother glares over at you and says as usual,\" I wish you wouldn't wear those hoodlum clothes you could look so nice if you would just dress normal.\" You smirk at her and say\" Sorry I don't wanna look like a dork and besides if i looked normal we would not have this lovely chat every day.\" She groans and says she has to go or she will be late for work and that you need to lock up and try to behave at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what you are use to her not being there and staying at home alone.You look at the clock and decide to go ahead and go get a little extra lunch money  donated to you. It is sooo hard being the enforcer but ohh so fun. You can't say that you don't enjoy being the toughest kid in school but it can be hard to live up to. Well anyway time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get on your bike and go to school or maybe somewhere else?</span></div></div>",

The water poured into a bucket and it hung as well on a hook screwed into the cell wall for you to use to drink, it all seems proper and yet wrong at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the cell people talk, as inside you cell you listen but the words fail to own much meaning, only a rare few words seem to have your mind realize what was said... this too causes a sense of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching breakfast, the uncivilized way the keeper forces you to dip the face to the box and use your tongue to lap-lick up the tasty food from that wooden box. When the food is gone and licked out of every corner of that crude musty scented box, a slurped drinking of the clean water quells the sense of frustration and anger for being jailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon then they will come and as the keeper did every morning, he entering you cell and without so much as a friendly word said, he clips a rope to that thing someone draped and latched snug about the head, as use it to make you move, to lead, and join then with other prisoners to do as shown, day after new day, boringly repetitious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spin-turn and while having to stand as not sit, reaching the head high and straining the neck to stretch, the lips reaching grab at the other other possible food available, that being strands of long, freshly cut grasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoarse kernel grains, fresh cut grasses, a bucket of water to slurp and drink from, totally inhumane treatment and all this because you kicked that dirty little dog?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Here, stall number nine, the stallion, the boss said to make use of him to breed the mares feeling their time of estrus.\"</b> A man said, and some of what he said, the mind knew and rational thinking processed, adding new knowledge to a situation cloaked by a forgetful brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds then of other prisoners walking past the cell on their way to work a monotonous job of making a machine revolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Lucky boy today fella, Mister Jacobs wants you to perform the way a good pony stallion should, you get to breed-mate four mares today, more tomorrow if you do each a good deed.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new words, those being \"Good and Deed,\" they ring a bell in the mind, as you recall the old man and what he said, you needing to do a hundred good deeds before you can become your truer self....wow !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In this story <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou are a school bully who angers a drifter who changes you into a dog( or other <br>\r\n<br>\r\nanimal but be reasonable) and makes you have to perform 100 good deeds to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nchange back into your former self. I am not trying to make an exact remake of the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstory so you can and should have fun with it. I have this rated pg18 since i believe <br>\r\n<br>\r\nan artist should have freedom in their creations.. I welcome additions but if <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey are stupid, just those one line entries, or just made to be annoying i will <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndelete. If you want the character can lose deeds for acting up and can find other <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntransformed animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrules<br>\r\n1. this is first person no he ran to the kid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. the only ones you can communicate with are the drifter, the last person you picked on and other animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. you can have it where you lose good deeds but no negatives the character can go back to 100 at a max<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. i will add to yours if you add to mine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo i hope that people will enjoy this story please commment and rate i appreciate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nany review if it is the honest opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS i thank whoever you are who gave me the gift that they did they know who they are and i do not.</td>",
