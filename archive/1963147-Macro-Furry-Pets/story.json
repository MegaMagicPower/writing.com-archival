Thunder occasionally roars loudly outside, and countless drops of rain slam loudly against the roof. Even though it was midnight, you couldn\u2019t get a moment of sleep no matter how hard you tried. You couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that you weren\u2019t alone -- that something was watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes scan your tiny bedroom, occasionally illuminated by the strikes of lightning, before coming to rest on your closet. You realized that, while the rest of your room was decently lit, your closet was completely, impossibly dark. Anything could be waiting in that darkness, staring back at you, invisible, waiting to strike when you least expect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze your eyes shut, trying to expel the thoughts from your mind. Your heart skips a beat when you look again and see large, glowing red eyes staring back at you from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"crose\">\u201cI brought cookies!\u201d</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden booming voice from your closet almost caused you jump out of your skin. <b>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</b> you yell, startled. <b>\u201cDon\u2019t scare me like that, Kasadya!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall, sylphlike figure emerged from your closet, stepping into the light. You recognized her easily. Nobody else you knew had a body like that. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"crose\">\u201cHehe! Sorry!\u201d</span></font> she giggled, flashing a cheerful, but ominously toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour visitor resembled an huge anthropomorphic bat, but with a few monstrous features, such as intimidating horns and a long forked tail. She was just less than 15 feet tall, being over three times your height. Being a monster, she was always both supernaturally voluptuous -- with pillowy breasts that were bigger than your head -- and naked, though her long purple fur did provide her some modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, in the remote city in which you lived, parents would often scare disobedient children with the tale of the <i>Kind\u0115k</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kind\u0115k, or so the legend goes, was a large anthro woman, tall enough to swallow a normal human whole. Most of the time, the Kind\u0115k was invisible, and would watch over the younglings of the city. When she found an obedient, innocent child, she would leave them gifts, or grant wishes for them. When she found someone nasty and corrupted, she would pester and haunt them and, if they don\u2019t change their ways, eventually devour them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you\u2019ve met this legendary \u2018Kind\u0115k\u2019, and in reality, her name is actually <span class=\"crose\">Kasadya</span>, and she was a total sweetheart. She may be a monster, but she was also one of the only friends you\u2019ve ever had. Before you met her, you assumed she was just a fake myth made to scare kids into obeying their parents, but as it turns out, the myth was completely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were very young, Kasadya seemed to take special interest in you for some reason. You would often find gifts mysteriously appearing in your room, and other strange \u2018coincidences\u2019. After you lost your parents, her sympathy for you increased, and she ended up revealing herself to you and offering you one wish. One wish for anything in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished for her to be your pet, and from then on, she had always been by your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasadya picked your tiny body up easily, and you blushed as she wrapped you in a warm hug. Since you are a third her size, she is far stronger than you are. <b>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</b> you ask as she hugs you against her chest. <b>\u201cYou haven\u2019t visited in three months!\u201d</b> Kasadya didn\u2019t want her existence to be discovered, so she could only visit you late at night, when everyone else was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"crose\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, pumpkin. I\u2019ve just been sooo busy,\u201d</span></font> she frowned, as she set you back on the floor. <span class=\"crose\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cChildren are just so disobedient nowadays! Smoking, cursing, bullying\u2026\u201d</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out a plate of cookies she brought with her.  <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"crose\">\u201cBut I can make it up to you. Here - chocolate chip cookies, hot out of the oven!\u201d</span></font> she smiled, offering you as many as you like. Most of the food you got to eat in your day-to-day life was slop, so Kasadya knew how much you appreciated treats like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAre you sure these are safe?\u201d</b> You say, staring incredulously at the snacks. <b>\u201cYou remember what happened last time you tried baking something.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"crose\">\u201cYep! I didn\u2019t even use a recipe from the necronomicon this time,\u201d</span></font> she insists. <span class=\"crose\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cJust a regular, non-evil cookbook. Here, try one!\u201d</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that it must\u2019ve been extremely difficult for her to bake these cookies given her large size, so you shrug and accept her gift. You hesitantly chomp down one of the cookies, only to be pleasantly surprised. <b>\u201cHm! These are pretty good!\u201d</b> you say, reaching for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles as you chow down, sitting down next to you on the bed, your small bed creaking beneath her butt. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><span class=\"crose\">\u201cSo how have you been doing while I\u2019ve been gone?\u201d</span></font> she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back on the past few months with grief. You\u2019ve been treated poorly by your guardians and peers, but even worse has been the crushing loneliness. <b>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2026\u201d</b> you say, your sadness apparent in your voice. <b>\u201cI just wish you didn\u2019t have to leave all the time.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cAwww,\u201d</font></span> she frowns, again.

Their abilities and traits vary wildly, but they all share a few features; they\u2019re all anthropomorphic women of varying shapes and sizes, they all have magical abilities, and they all have a peculiar diet consisting entirely of human kids. In folklore, they are commonly referred to as \u2018boogeymen\u2019, as if somehow designed to scare children into behaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Kasadya only has to eat every month or so, so it\u2019s usually not that big an inconvenience. It was now, though. <b>\u201cPlease!\u201d</b> you ask, giving her a cute, pleading look. <b>\u201cYou can eat while you\u2019re here!

During the day, she had to stay invisible, so nobody would notice her. But at night, when everyone else was sleeping, you and her stayed up having fun until the wee hours of the morning, as long as you didn\u2019t make too much noise. Even though your time with her was limited, it was always great having her over -- she was your only real friend, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you want to do on your first night together?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just how on Earth did humans come to preside over anthros in the first place? After all, anthros range anywhere from 5 to 50 times taller than the average human, so you think they\u2019d be the ones in control. It\u2019s a good question - one anthropologists have been debating for centuries. Just the fact that humans still exist at all is a miracle. There were plenty of other intelligent species that were around human size, but they all went extinct long ago, devoured by the massive anthros. So why did the human race survive? Well, it\u2019s simple - they\u2019re not very tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how did humans manage to not only befriend anthros, but rule over them? Knowing humans, you might assume that the answer was through warfare - that they might\u2019ve dominated the anthros using explosives and fire. In reality, though, humans came to become the dominant species through diplomacy! You see, anthros have BIG appetites, and humans were the only species to master agriculture, allowing them to grow enough crops to keep the anthros well-fed. Once anthros are well-fed, they\u2019re docile, so the anthros quickly allowed themselves to be tamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least, that\u2019s what this textbook you\u2019re reading says. Living deep in the labyrinthian alleyways of New Fluff, reading was one of your only hobbies, and you always enjoyed pouring through the books your feline companions brought for you, in exchange for your \u2018services\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, perhaps I\u2019m getting ahead of myself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllow me to explain. Have you ever heard of a \u2018feral child\u2019? Someone who\u2019s taken in and raised by animals, instead of humans? Well, you\u2019re sort of one of those. When you were born you were abandoned by your mother, left to - you shudder to think- die in an alleyway in the rain. Luckily, one of the local alleycats just so happened to hear you crying\u2026 and ended up bringing you to a community of cats just like her. They were all \u2018strays\u2019 - anthros who have been abandoned by their owners\u2019 - and thus, they sympathized with your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then, these alleyways have been your home, and the local strays have been raising you like one of their own. They\u2019ve given you the human name of \u2018Joseph\u2019, although you also go by a nickname, \u2018Catnip\u2019. You don\u2019t really speak to your fellow humans much, preferring the company of your feline companions\u2026 speaking of which, from the massive footsteps growing louder, you can tell one of them is approaching!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\u201cGood mornin\u2019, Catnip!\u201d</font> The lid of the little cardboard box you were resting in was pulled over, and a massive, smiling, feline face loomed over you. You chuckled as you started up into her massive, excitable, golden feline eyes. You\u2019d recognize those eyes anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Vivian!\u201d You waved, only to giggle a bit, startled, when she reaches into the box and grabs you by the shirt collar, lifting you up in the air. Vivian was an egyptian mau, with beautiful white fur with light gray patterns. Like the other strays, she was, of course, completely naked, although her long, silk-like fur lent her some modesty. Like the other cats, she was about 50 feet tall, meaning she could easily carry you in the palm of her hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the rush?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cOh, I don\u2019t need ya for anything, myself! One of the other cats jus\u2019 wanted me to come fetch ya,\u201d</font> she giggled as she walked, carefully holding you in her hand. A sultry, teasing look dawned on her face as she continued. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cShe said it was an \u2018emergency\u2019.\u201d</font> You smile a bit, excited. An \u2018emergency\u2019... you know what that means!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, one of the other ways in which humans befriended anthros was by showing their usefulness as, well\u2026 \u2018toys\u2019. After all, humans are small enough to fit into all sorts of nooks and crannies, and the resulting sensations can be mind blowing, or so you\u2019ve been told. Well, recently, in exchange for all of the hard work they\u2019ve done for you, you\u2019ve started offering these sorts of\u2026 \u2018services\u2019 to the alley cats you live with. Yeah\u2026 let\u2019s just say you\u2019ve come to know all of them on a very <i>deep, intimate</i> level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian was probably your favorite. She was always so gentle, always listening to what you had to say and trying to make it fun for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was Bianca and Serena - a maine coon and a norwegian forest cat, respectively, who were madly in love with eachother, and often asked for your help \u2018spicing up\u2019 their sex life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was Jeanette, who was a little\u2026 rough around the edges. She was the domineering type, being a little forceful and loving to squeeze down around you, trying to show you who\u2019s in charge. Though, deep down, you knew she had a softer side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Fleur, a chausie with beautiful dyed fur. She rarely requested your help, considering she already knew plenty of anthros boys around town who were all eager to satisfy her every desire. But, when you\u2019re lucky, she\u2019s occasionally in the mood to toy with a human. In those times, you\u2019re always blown away by just how\u2026 hypnotic and seductive she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, there was Rosalind, a savannah cat who was, apparently, abused by her previous owner, and doesn\u2019t seem to trust humans. Thus, she only requests your help when she\u2019s in heat, and even in those times, you have to be very careful and gentle with her. You honestly feel sorry for her, sometimes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, as Vivian navigates the winding alleyways, you soon see who you\u2019ll be serving today!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Poor Jeanette. Like all strays, she had been treated cruelly by humans in the past\u2026 in fact, she had almost received the worst treatment back when she was a pet, second only to Jeanette. The abuse she\u2019s gone through left her with a scar on her face, and what some would call a bad attitude. She was the guard for the strays, as her aggression made her great in combat\u2026 but not so great at appealing to potential mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian led you to some tucked-away corner of an alleyway, where Jeanette was lying on a stained old mattress, two fingers already plunged into her sex as she tried to work through some pent-up frustrations. She had gone on a date with some canine guy from another pack last night, and from the look on her face, it hadn\u2019t gone well. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cFinally! Took ya long enough!\u201d</font> She growled as Vivian walked up, and snatched you from her hands. In response to her rudeness, Vivian only giggled, nonplussed as she trotted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a little startled yelp as her hand suddenly clamped down around you\u2026 but eventually, her fingers unfurled, revealing her frustrated-looking face looming over you. She was actually quite pretty, in your opinion, with more of a toned, fit body than the other girls, betraying her as something of an athlete. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cAlright, runt! Full disclosure; I\u2019m in a shitty mood right now, and I need to blow off some steam,\u201d</font> she lectured you, her teeth grit tightly. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m on a short fuse right now, so don\u2019t piss me off! Just do your job and do it well. Got it?\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d You immediately respond, obediently. When you were growing up here, you used to hate Jeanette. You thought she was mean, and cruel, and always on the verge of getting angry. You thought she was going to eat you one of these days! But over the years, you\u2019ve come to realize - she wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. This short temper of hers\u2026 its all a response to some\u2026 helplessness she\u2019s felt in her life. After all, pets trusted their owners with their lives\u2026 so to have your owner betray that trust and abuse you\u2026 well, it must be more devastating than you could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, you almost pitied Jeanette\u2026 even as she was lowering you between her legs, holding you feet-first before her (comparatively) giant pussy as she reached down and spread her lips with her fingers. Jeanette always seemed embarrassed to be getting pleasured by a human, so she always wanted your \u2018sessions\u2019 over with as quickly as possible. It wasn\u2019t long before your toes feel warm and wet as they\u2019re pressed against her vulva\u2026 and with a quiet gasp, she pushes even harder and gently slips you in up to your ankles into her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grit her teeth, trying her best to look aloof even as she was blushing beet red. She tried desperately not to make any noises, but as you were slipped deeper into her, she couldn\u2019t help but letting out a few quiet purrs and whimpers, which were always music to your ears. Instead of just tucking you away completely, though, you know there\u2019s something she likes you to do for her first. Just when you were about halfway buried in her warm, tight pussy, you leaned forward\u2026 and started sending your tongue lapping along her sensitive clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cMm\u2026 ooh\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d</font> She immediately shuddered, leaning back, not even bothering to pretend not to be enjoying this anymore. She was wriggling a bit involuntarily, gasping and moaning as one half of you was wriggling around inside of her, and the other half was diligently working on her clit. Sure, she might be a good 45 feet or so taller than you\u2026 but in this moment, you had her wrapped around your finger. Being able to make such a huge, powerful feline lost herself in ecstasy was always a thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, you can\u2019t help but notice that something was\u2026 off. She didn\u2019t seem to be enjoying this as much as she usually was. She was trying to get into it, but it seemed her mind was just\u2026 elsewhere. Eventually, you realize she must still be thinking about that guy earlier. He must\u2019ve really broken her heart. \u201cHey\u2026 Jeanette?\u201d Her dopey expression suddenly disappears as she looked down at you, wondering why you had stopped licking. \u201cI just wanted to say\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if that night with that wolf guy didn\u2019t work out. I mean, there are plenty of other fish in the sea. You don't have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was baffled. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you-?\u201d</font> From the look on her face, you realize you had just made her angrier than she already was! That wolf guy was the LAST thing she needed to be reminded of right now! Before you can even apologize, she pressed two fingers down on top of your head. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cUgh, just\u2026 get in there!\u201d</font> Without letting you get a word in edgewise, she simply thrusts her fingers into her sex\u2026 and you are suddenly completely enveloped in darkness and tightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a\u2026 familiar sensation. To be tucked away completely inside one of the felines you so love, feeling the utter warmth and softness of their inner walls. There was nothing more relaxing in the world\u2026 although you didn\u2019t take too much time to savor it. You had a job to do! You immediately get to work kissing, rubbing, massaging, and licking the slick walls, fumbling around in the darkness and knowing that you\u2019ve found her G-spot when she suddenly tenses up and gasps. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cMm\u2026 ffuck\u2026\u201d</font> She sighed, her tongue lulling from her mouth as she was overcome with bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her worries were slowly being forgotten as she laid there, rubbing at her clit fervently, feeling you moving around inside of her in just the right ways to make her purr. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cMm\u2026 you see? This is where\u2026 you little runty humans\u2026 belong\u2026\u201d</font> She manages to breathe out inbetween gasps and moans. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cI think Vivian has been - ooh - spoiling you! You need someone to\u2026 put you in your place\u2026\u201d</font> Indeed, Jeanette was definitely something of a\u2026 domineering type. Especially when it came to humans\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer favorite part was left to come, however. You tried to rub at her walls just as vigorously and relentlessly as she liked it\u2026 but of course, your muscles soon grew sore, and you started to slow down. You knew what would happen next. All of a sudden, her pussy clenches down around you, and you let out a uncomfortable yelp as she relentlessly squeezes you! <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cMm\u2026 don\u2019t think you can slack off, now! You know what will happen!\u201d</font> She cooed, tensing up her hips as she squeezed at you. You quickly get the point, and go back to pleasuring her with all the strength you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she loses herself again, and you\u2019re jostled around slightly as she gently started moving her hips, rubbing at her clit with one hand and toying with a nipple with the other, enjoying your every movement. She delights in squeezing you painfully tightly every time you started to slack off, but for the most part, she just sits back and enjoys. Eventually, you could feel her entire body start to tense up. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cAh! F-fuck! Ahh\u2026 oooh!\u201d</font> As her climax finally hits her, your world feels like it\u2019s turned upside down as muscles start clenching and undulating wildly around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rides out her orgasm, you can hear clearly hear her gasping and yowling\u2026 but eventually, everything goes still, and she goes silent. You can hear her faintly panting in exhaustion, her entire body limp for a while as she slips into a half-conscious state of ecstasy. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cHhng\u2026 ooo\u2026 damn fine job, runt!\u201d</font> She chuckles as she eventually sits up. You rest inside of her as you can hear her light up a cigarette. As she smokes, she can\u2019t help but think about what you said earlier. Come to think of it\u2026 you really did seem to be concerned for her, and she might\u2019ve been a little rude in hindsight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cHey, uh\u2026 Joseph. I know I can say some\u2026 mean stuff sometimes. I, uh\u2026 I hope you know I don\u2019t really mean it, right?\u201d</font> She says idly, her voice completely audible to you from your perch inside of her. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cI mean, like\u2026 it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about you. You\u2019re a\u2026 really nice guy. Like, I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you or anything! It\u2019s just\u2026 I can get into a\u2026 bad mood sometimes, and\u2026 I think I take it out on you too much\u2026\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell she struggles to express her emotions like this\u2026 but it means the world to you! She shivers a bit as you gently rub against the walls in affirmation, a smile on your face. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cSo ya understand? Good,\u201d</font> she nods. Some time later, she finishes her little smoke break and stands, slipping on that old, stained leather jacket she always likes to wear. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201cNow, I\u2019m gonna run some errands. Surely, you don\u2019t mind staying in there for a while?\u201d</font> She chuckles a bit as you gently rub at the walls again, which she took as a \u2018yes\u2019. With that, she was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, getting relaxed, feeling her walk and listening to the sound of her voice as she hummed a little tune to herself. Nothing was more comfortable than being curled up inside one of these felines like this. Sometimes you idly fantasized about going deeper, and curling up inside their wombs, never having to worry about anything again\u2026 but they were quick to remind you that that\u2019s really not how it works. You just had to face the fact that, eventually, you were going to have to face the cold, unpredictable outside world again. It was a sad thought\u2026 but for now, all you had to do was sit back, relax, and savor the moment...</span></div></div>",

As you walked through the suburban neighborhoods you looked at the many massive houses which were renovated to accommodate for their huge pets, some of which were playing in the gardens, having a nap or even coming up to you for a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you got home and opened the 60 ft high door, which was surprisingly light considering its sturdiness. No one was in although you could smell the unmistakable scent of your freshly cleaned cat Luna. You then called for her, \"Luna, I'm home.\" As if en queue your cat ran out of the sitting room and leaped towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a beautiful black cat, hence the name Luna. Last year she reached her peak height of 50 ft at just 13 years of age. She outgrew you a long time ago although you still have those fond, if brief memories of holding her in your arms as a little kitten, which she will always be to you. The moment you both looked at each other you both knew it would be a lifelong friendship, and you've been inseparable ever since. At first she would always cry when you were in school and she still reacts the same when you arrive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically she was also at her peak. A bit muscular but still extremely soft to hug, especially with her warm, soft fur. She was always clean, even after messing in dirt she remained somehow clean. Her legs were impossibly long, even when she was normal height it was obvious. Her nails sharp but regularly trimmed. Her assets were perfect as well (T and A), even to the point where you got stuck in her cleavage sometimes when she hugged you. Her hair was black, and she loved to change styles very often. Her eyes were a hypnotizing shade of hazel/green, but were circle rather than slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately you were also teaching her how to speak English, and a few months ago she finally became fluent, revealing a deep, sexy but feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sprinted at you and lifted you up with her tail into one of her impossibly tight hugs, and once again got trapped in her cleavage.</span></div></div>",

Whenever you tried to get up, Luna would tighten her grip around you, making it impossible to leave her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uncharacteristic behavior began to concern you. What is she doing? Did I do something to upset her? Eventually you decided to turn around and ask her. \"Why won't you let me go Luna?

Your world seemed to stop as she said that one word which she only ever referred to you as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly you could see her reasons as perfectly rational. You taught her everything you knew, even how to speak perfectly. She was strong both physically and mentally and your love was both mutual and boundless. But at the same time you were nervous. How could you say no and risk her potential anger. She was in a serious mood, and you never saw her angry before and now that you think about it, you may never want to. She would never hurt you, but maybe would take you for herself and no one else. She never liked the sight of another unknown female in the house. She wanted to be the only female companion you ever needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly petted you on the head as you thought about it in your mind, which made you truly realize that she would be a perfect owner to you. Kind, loving, considerate, friendly. You finally came to a conclusion. \"Okay Lun... I mean... Master. You are now my owner.\" Luna's eyes beamed with glee at your response, and hugged you ever so tightly while giving you countless kisses in thanks. \"Thank you sweetie. I promise you won't regret this decision. I'll be as loving an owner to you as you were to me.\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately she didn't quite state the context in which she would be a loving owner. Contrary to the belief that you would be a pet to your cat you were instead treated like a baby. She wouldn't ever let you leave her sight, even to the point of you leaving school as a result. She cooed upon seeing you and sang lullabies for you at night, which admittedly was nice due to her pleasant singing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the most awkward thing for you though was her insistence on giving her baby the 'appropriate nutrition', i.e. your own cat's breast milk. You didn't even know she could lactate at will but in truth you should really stop being surprised by Luna's abilities. She would often breastfeed you like you were her own baby and it was quite a shameful pleasure of yours because it tasted heavenly. You no longer slept in your own bed, instead sleeping in your master's bed and snuggling up to her warm, soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis became the custom for your new life for the last week or so.

She's big, but since she's a mousegirl, is smaller than usual furry pets; she's almost twice your size. She appears to be your age, and has grey fur, medium-length brown hair, bright blue eyes, and lots of freckles... and with a long stare at her, you notice she's not wearing any clothes. You stop staring at her chest as she approaches. She's glancing over her shoulder, but turns to notice you. With a squeak, she starts blushing heavily and covering her privates with her paws, then she hurries past you and crouches behind you, as if she's trying to hide behind you despite the size difference making that impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she covered her privates when she saw you, you assume she's intelligent to some degree, more so than standard, untrained, wild furries, like she seems to be one of. So, you glance back at her, slightly startled by the sight of her slightly chubby face inches from your own, and ask her what she's afraid of, expecting an answer due to the aforementioned intelligence you assume she has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately get an answer, but not form her. A giant catgirl comes around the corner. She's very dirty-looking--a stray, by your guess--and you can approximate her height as being 40 feet or so.. She has matted black fur and dull green eyes, with black and unkempt hair on her head. She's crouching, and has her hand-paws on the ground. She apparently has no clothes, but her hair is long enough to cover her chest, and she seems to constantly keep her tail wrapped around herself and covering her privates. She freezes when she notices you standing between her and the mousegirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mousegirl squeaks in fear and cowers more, and the catgirl frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human,\" she says, her voice somewhat shaky. \"D-didn't expect to see one of you again... Just... leave, okay? I need to... just let me get to that mousegirl, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're confused by some of what she says, especially the part about not expecting to see another human even though she lives in a city, and you're unsure what she wants with the mousegirl. Most likely, she sees the mousegirl as prey, and you don't want to allow a mousegirl to die by refusing to try and protect her. On the other hand, the catgirl can easily get you out of the way if she wanted, and it might be pointless to resist her. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Even so, you stand there, glaring up at the giant cat furry as she very slowly moves towards you, continuing to stay on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You're not gonna leave her, are you?\" the cat furry says. She's trying to sound menacing, you can tell, but she just seems very unsure and upset more than anything. \"Well then... I'll just have to get you out of the way, then? You won't move at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Leave her alone!\" you shout, surprised at your own bravery (or stupidity) as you stand up to this catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl frowns. Then, with speed that shocks you, she lunges. Both hand-paws outstretched, she hits the ground right in front of you and slams her paws together, trapping you painfully between them. The mousegirl squeaks loudly and falls over backwards, scrambling away as she stares in fear at the catgirl that just snatched the human trying to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the catgirl's paws, you squirm and shout, but the grip is too tight for you to escape. She's holding you between both paws, pressing them together to keep you in place, but she soon begins to manipulate you in her paws until she is holding you in one paw, clenched into a fist with you held inside from your chest to your knees. This is a position you've been in several times--furries are typically big enough to hold a human in their paws even at a relatively young age, and you've willingly (and sometimes unwillingly) had furries pick you up many times before. It's a feeling you've gotten used to by now, but this time, it scares you, since you're not sure what this catgirl plans to do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms are free, since you had them raised when trying to protect the mousegirl, and so you start pounding on the catgirl's furry hand and shouting for her to let you go. Unfortunately, she simply squeezes you, forcing you to stop so she won't hurt you further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that you've given up resistance, the catgirl picks herself up off the ground and rises to a knee, bringing you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't hurt you,\" she says, to your surprise. \"I'm upset that you got in my way. But that doesn't make me want to hurt you. I just want to talk to the mousegirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, talk?\" you ask. \"You mean, you won't eat her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat her! That's disgusting, of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then why didn't you just tell me? I thought you wanted to kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't believe me,\" the cat furry says with a small shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself that you're glad she apparently is gentle, although you're a bit upset that she didn't tell you that sooner. You're also glad to know that the mousegirl won't be hurt, if the catgirl is telling the truth. Even so, you're not sure if you want to leave the two of them alone; you'd feel better if you stay with them and listen to them, making sure the catgirl doesn't hurt the mousegirl. However, where is the mousegirl?</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s feminine, and is noticeably shaky, as if in fear. It seems to be closer to your age than the dog furry holding you, but still younger than you. Interestingly, it seems quite loud, so you assume it's from a furry instead of a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unable to turn around enough to get a good look, but the dog furry holding you can apparently see who's making the noise. \"No!\" she says, suddenly squeezing you tightly to her fluffy chest. \"MY human!

So, you decide it would probably be safe to stay here with her, at least for a little bit, because it seems like she wants to talk with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought, she continues to speak. \"Um... listen, I...

You have some spare time; you can talk with this catgirl for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl smiles at you, revealing a single fang that worries you slightly due to its sharpness, but you're still not afraid of this furry, and remain in the alley, waiting for her to answer your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... See, I've been a stray all my life, and I've always wanted to live with a human... I've always been ignored or hated, though, and I've been starting to give up hope... Do you think you could... y'know... adopt me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden question is very surprising, and you stare up at the giant catgirl for a few moments, unsure of how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... that's a really big question there, kitty,\" you say. \"It's not so easy to adopt someone, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't want to, I understand,\" the catgirl says quietly, starting to turn and head back deeper into the alley. \"I'll just talk to the next human that comes in here...

Before you can finish your sentence, the cat anthro sprints towards you and quickly picks you up and brings her to her very comfortable chest, hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a tiny yelp to be heard from you, but as you noticed that she was being gentle, you decided not to yell for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" the cat anthro said, seemingly saying that hundreds of times. \u201cI promise you that you won't regret your decision! I'll be the best pet ever!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit at this reaction from the anthro, you say to her: \"It's no problem at all. Besides, I think that this will be really fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you said that, she brought you to her face, and you noticed that she started bringing you towards her maw. You thought for a second that she might try to eat you, but you shaked that feeling out when you remembered how thankful she was. Instead she started licking your face, giving you thanks for what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stopped licking you, you remembered that you still haven't told her your name. \"My name is Jason, by the way. But friends just call me Jay.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jasmine, but my friends call me Jazz.\" She said, looking at you with a happy stare. \"Oh and sorry picking you the way I did. I was just so excited at having finally found a home after all these years. Sorry if I scared you or anything like that!\" She said that as she began setting you down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping down from her paws, you say \"Hey, it's no problem at all. I actually liked that hug. Your fur felt really comfortable.\" You looked at her blush for a second there after you said that last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, how about we head to my house. It's about 5 blocks down the street. It's getting pretty late already and I don't want anyone else snatching me up like that dog anthro\" You tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to!\" She said enthusiastically. \"And, if you don't mind, may I hold you in my paw again? We will get there quicker if you let me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, you tell her \"Sure, you can hold me again, just be careful please!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, she lowers her paw with her fingers stretched out and her palm facing up. \"Hop on, then! And don't worry, I promise I'll be super careful!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step onto Jazz's hand carefully, making your way to the center of her outstretched paw. Once that you make it to the center you lie down against her thumb. After making sure that you are comfortable enough, Jazz begins lowering her other paw on top of you, so you'll be safe on the journey home, in case Jazz bumps against another anthro. Once that she is certain that you are secure, she begins raising her paws slowly until you are next to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so excited! My first home!\" She says while walking out of the alley and out into the street. \"No more sleeping on the cold ground or being wet while trying to get out of the rain, and this is all because of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins purring at the thought of a warm bed, bringing you up from time to time to cuddle against her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thought just hit you. Where will Jazz sleep? While you have a house big enough for Jazz, you don't have a bed made for anthros, or any other kind of supplies such as food or shampoo made specially for cats. Not wanting to disappoint Jazz when she arrives home without any place for her to sleep other than the ground, you decide that the best course of action isn't going straight for home, but to make a quick stop (Or maybe a long stop, depending how many things you need to make Jazz's stay comfortable). So, you decide to change course before you arrive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jazz, you say to her \"Hey, Jazz. I was thinking of making a quick stop somewhere else before heading home. I have to buy a few things. Would you mind taking me there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! A few more minutes out here won't make a big difference and I'm used to it.\" She says, while she stops looking around her. \"Which way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a few blocks down that way. We should be there in a couple of minutes\" You tell her, trying not to reveal to much since this might be a pleasant surprise for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the store, you decide to ask her something: \"\u00bfSo you have never had a place to call home in your entire life?\". Without looking at you, she says in a solemn voice \"Well, not really. I was born somewhere in the city, on the streets. I can't remember much, of where, but I do remember that my mom took care of me most of my life in the alley that I met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she mentioned her mom, you wonder why she wasn't with Jazz back at the alley when that anthro dog captured you, but you decide it might be a bad topic for conversation having just met Jazz. Besides, you don't want to ruin Jazz's mood. She seems so happy about finally having a home and you can even see her smiling every time she turns her gaze to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that you see the pet store coming up, you tap Jazz's thumb and ask her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Jazz looking a bit confused, looking around for another store. \"Are you sure we are there yet? I don't see another shop besides the pet store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jazz is looking at you for answers, you make a big grin. That's enough to send a loud and clear message to Jazz about your intentions of bringing her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be joking!\" She says, with and incredulous look on her face. \"We just met, and you want to buy me stuff? You are the best human ever!\"<br>\r\nShe brings you up to her face and starts licking you for what seems like hours. Once that she is finished, you are soaked in her saliva. She starts looking at you with a kind of loving gaze once that she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about we head inside? I\u2019ll let you choose whatever bed you want.\u201d You say to her. \u201cBut make sure to also choose some clothes. We can\u2019t have you walking around with only your fur coverings now, can we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles at your last remark and starts making her way inside with a quick pace. You can see her face and see a hint of glee. <br>\r\nOnce inside, you both marvel at the size of the store. There must a million things for pets inside of this store. There\u2019s hundreds of categories for pet supplies, with different species in mind and a massive selection of clothing for each species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz sets you down on the ground and starts darting from stand to stand, marveling at each item selection made for cats. You can hear her \u201cOohs!\u201d and \u201cAhs!\u201d every time she sees something she likes. Once that you get to the bed aisle, you can see Jazz\u2019s expression suddenly change. She looks like she is about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright, Jazz?\u201d You say. Once that she hears this, she wipes away a tear and says \u201cOh, I\u2019m actually so happy. It just reminded me of sleeping on the ground, on a piece of cardboard all the time. And now, I\u2019m actually going to sleep in a bed for the first time. It\u2019s amazing to think about it!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Just make sure you choose a bed that you like. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that she has chosen her bed, some clothes, a sofa for anthros and supplies, you make your way to the cashier. It looks like the cashier is an anthro Iguana with a human sitting on her shoulder. Once that we make our way there, she smiles at us and asks if that\u2019s all. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t have a way to transport the bed and the sofa to my home right now. Do you have a transport service or something like that to help us out?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at you, she says \u201cOf course, sir!\u201d while she passes out a form \u201cIf you fill your address here, we will transport your furniture to your home. If you live close by, we might even be able to take the furniture there tonight since we don\u2019t have anything else that requires transport services right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that you fill the form, Jazz picks you up again and holds you on her paws. You begin to notice how soft her paws are with all the fur, even if Jazz seems to be a bit dirty at the moment. You also notice some little scars on the exposed skin of her palms. Looks like she lived a rough life back in the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head outside, Jazz brings you to her chest and gives you a hug. You can feel her breasts on either side of you. You notice that they are big, even for anthro standards, but you quickly banish the thought. Once outside, you give directions to Jazz towards your home and she begins moving with a slow pace, savoring every moment while hugging you and purring with content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home\u2026</span></div></div>",

You can feel her heart rate accelerate as you tell her that you are close to your home, clearly showing how excited she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive outside your home, Jazz is marveled at how huge your house is. She has a huge grin on her face, almost like she is contemplating all the fun times she is going to have in her new home. It's a good thing that the previous owner had anthros living with him, so Jazz should be able to accommodate easily to her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to the doorstep, the door is easily 50 feet tall, enough to accommodate Jazz's height. You then take your keys out of your pocket and signal Jazz to put you down so you can open the \"side door\" which is made for humans. Once inside, you press a button next to the huge door to unlock it and let Jazz inside. Once unlocked, the door almost instantly opens and Jazz comes running inside all excited with glee showing on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking around the main hallway, she runs back to you and picks you up, hugging you to her chest. You can hear and feel her purr happily. You kinda feel like she is acting a bit like a little kitten, although a huge one at that. You feel that the hug lasts for an half an hour, but it actually only lasted for a couple of minutes. Once that she stops hugging you, she brings you to her face and starts licking you over and over again. You can feel her tongue all over your face. It kind of feels raspy, but at the same time it feel kind of nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she is done, you are dripping with drool. When she sees this, she starts giggling and apologizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you like to do next?\" You ask Jazz, staring her at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which she replies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

OUR home!\u201d You giggle, stroking Jasmine\u2019s thumb as you sit there looking at her face. She is looking at you wide, with her eyes already welling up from all the excitement and joy that she has had during the day. She brings you to her lips and instead of licking you again, she gives you a kiss on your head. They literally cover your entire head, her lips molding around it. You can feel her warm flesh it transfers some of it\u2019s hit to you as it makes contact, as well as a damp feeling, as her lips are somewhat wet from her saliva. You feel light sucking as she puckers her lips, before she pulls you away from the kiss. You are speechless, unable come up with words to communicate what you feel. As you look at her, she is looking at you with care. You see her lips moving saying a silent \u201cThank you\u201d, before she lowers you down to her shoulder. You hop off and sit down, grabbing strands of her fur for support and for balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a little ahem, breaking out the awkward moment, before speaking. \u201cSo\u2026 Let\u2019s start with the living room, shall we?\u201d you said, pointing at the room lying in front of both of you. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a pretty cozy place. It has a fireplace to keep me warm during the winters, a flat screen TV and a sofa, which turns into a bed in case there are any guests staying over.\u201d You say, sounding like a sales agent. Before you continue, Jazz interrupts you by holding a hand in front of you, like if she had a question. \u201cYes?\u201d You ask, a bit curious about her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s all beautiful looking and all, but I don\u2019t see anything of what you are speaking of. The room is empty.\u201d She says, a bit perplexed. You laugh, pointing at a little corner of the living room where said things were, done for your size. \u201cOoooooooh\u201d she let\u2019s out, realization dawning upon her as she lets out a soft giggle. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m living on my own inside a house made for giant anthros. Why get giant stuff if I\u2019m living on my own.\u201d You say, shrugging at the situation. Jasmine walks over to the tiny set of furniture lying on the corner and crouches down, inspecting the TV and the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s cute!\u201d she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that you think so, but we aren\u2019t done with the tour yet. Onwards!\u201d you yell, as you buckle and point towards the kitchen. She lets out another giggle, before walking over there. To her surprise, the kitchen was fully equipped for her size. \u201cThe previous owner thought that it would be too much trouble to take everything from here with him, so he only took the fridge and the microwave with him.\u201d You tell her, as she walks around the kitchen, marveling at the cabinets and at the remaining kitchen appliances. \u201cOf course, we will have to live without a fridge for you for awhile. In the meantime, we will have to make do with Cans of food and what not. I hope that you like tuna!\u201d You tell her, a bit worried that she might not feel welcome without fresh food. To your surprise, she is quite happy. \u201cOh, of course I love tuna! I always had to scavenge from trash piles, so this is quite the improvement for me!\u201d She says with joy in her voice, as she gives you a tiny peck on the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue showing her the rest of the house, including the guest room where she will be staying and your room. As you finish the tour of the house, you hear the bell ringing. Someone is at the door. You head over there with Jasmine and peak over the window. It\u2019s the pet store helpers\u2019, bringing all the things that you bought over in a giant truck made from anthros. Jasmine giddily open the door and sets you on her palm, as you are handed some documents that need your signature. As soon as that\u2019s done, Jasmine steps aside as a couple anthro dogs walk in, carrying inside what you had bought at the store, making multiple trips between your home and the truck. As soon as they are done, a tiny human sitting on one of the anthros shoulders waves goodbye and they depart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine closes the door, and immediately runs over to the new sofa and jumps in, you still in her hand. The world spins around you, as gravity shifts from side to side, until she finally lands. You are a bit disoriented, but before you know it, Jasmine is licking you again, purring all the while. This was one happy kitty.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter awhile of chatting and getting to know each other better, you let out a loud yawn. She follows suit, stretching and yawning. \u201cWell, it\u2019s getting late. I better let you sleep. It has been a long day!\u201d You tell her, before you motion her to let you down. Before she does, she brings you up to her face, and looks at you with pleading eyes. \u201cI\u2026 know that you have done a lot for me, and I shouldn\u2019t be asking for more after all you have given me, but\u2026 could you sleep just this night with me?\u201d She pauses a bit, before bringing you closer to her face. \u201cIt\u2019s just, since it\u2019s my new home, and I have known that alley I was for many years, I might feel a bit lonely\u2026\u201d Before she continues, you cut her off, waving with your hand and smiling. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for explanations. I\u2019ll be happy to sleep tonight with you, Jazz!\u201d As you say this, she brings you down to her chest for a hug. Softness and warmth surrounds you, as both her flesh and fur brush against you. She doesn\u2019t stop hugging you, and instead begins walking to her room with you trapped between her chest and her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrives to the foot of her new bed, she flops down face up against the bed. Her body bounces a bit as she settles. She opens her arms, revealing your tiny figure cradled between her huge orbs. You wiggle out and stand between her chest. \u201cAlright, then. Goodnight Jazz!\u201d You say, as you turn around to jump off her body and onto the mattress. Before you do, she pins you down with one hand and snuggles you to her cleavage. \u201cWhere do you think you are going? I never said you\u2019d sleep on the bed, silly.\u201d She says, with a sly grin on her face, showing off one of her fangs. You blush, of course, surprised at her sudden request. Well, not a request, more of a command. You smile shyly, before speaking \u201cI\u2026 Are you sure? I\u2026 don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOf course not! I was the one that made the request, remember? Now lie down and enjoy.\u201d She says, her voice soft. You can feel and hear her purr, content to have you there with her. She brings a hand up and setting it on you, covering your head and torso. As you lay there, you are glad that you made the decision and adopted her. This was truly going to be an interesting start to both of your new lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon fall asleep, both from her purring and one of her fingers patting your head. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dog furry holding you takes a few steps towards the young man, but he holds up a hand for her to stop.<br>\r\n\"Who's that, girl?\" he asks, pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My human!\" she says, holding you out in front of herself. You look over your shoulder at the man on the ground some distance away from and below you, and shrug as best you can. Seeing as your arms are currently pinned in the soft, yet tight, grip of this dog furry, you can't really make the gesture too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighs and tells the dog furry to put you down. She follows the order, looking at you sadly as she walks over to the man. The man apologizes to you, then continues walking down the sidewalk, the dog furry following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. It's a shame some people can't control their pets. Even if all the pets around here are many times the size of humans, they're almost always trained extensively to be obedient, by owners or breeders. Apparently, sometimes young furries just forget their training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what to do next. You could continue on your way back home, but you really want to know who the owner of that voice in the alley was.<br>\r\nYou decide to check the alley. Walking into it again, you see a giant shape moving in the shadows. It stops when you approach, and you decide to speak.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say. \"Who are you? Are you the one that tried to get the dog furry to release me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadows comes an interesting sight. A cat furry, but very dirty-looking--a stray, by your guess. She has matted black fur and dull green eyes, with black and unkempt hair on her head. She's crouching, and has her hand-paws on the ground. She apparently has no clothes, but her hair is long enough to cover her chest, and she seems to constantly keep her tail wrapped around herself and covering her privates. She stops approaching you when she's about twenty feet away, and you can approximate her height as being 40 feet or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes... I spoke up...\" she stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. Something is definitely wrong with this furry. She seems so afraid... \"Is something wrong? Why are you so scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath before replying. \"Well... You see...\"</span></div></div>",

Another prod.<br>\r\n\"Master, it's time to wake up.\"<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" You mumble louder.<br>\r\n\"Master Keith, I'm sorry, but if you don't get up now, you'll be late for your Anthro-History class.\" With that, you feel a strong force pull your warm covering off of you- she's taken your blankets.<br>\r\nUuuuuugh.<br>\r\nYou rise to greet the world around you, another Monday, another week of tedious classes to go. You yawn and rub the sleep from your eyes as Tundra stares at you intently with her piercing blue gaze. You got her when she was still a young puppy at eight years old, ten years ago, and the husky still somehow beat you to maturity. Tch. Anthros. Still, at least her eyes stayed beautiful.<br>\r\nYou pick your clothes out of your closet and get into the shower for another day of classes at Hamilton Grove University, pulling the screen around your living space. You don't know why you bothered; Tundra could and would sneak a peek over your curtain that 'partitioned' your space from hers whenever she felt like it, at fifty feet tall. (Forty-nine and nine inches, but whatever.) Speaking of which...<br>\r\n\"Tundra...\" You call out warningly, feeling her icy azure gaze wandering over to you.<br>\r\n\"I'm not looking, Master,\" She called out in a sing-song voice, happily munching on some eggs and bacon she had on her own over-sized table. Suuure she wasn't. At times like this you wistfully juggled the idea of getting a solo dorm room for yourself, but you know it'll never happen. The rooms were expensive enough as it is at a college just getting one for yourself, and you certainly didn't have the budget for both Tundra and yourself to get perfect privacy. The human-only dorms were really only reserved for visitors, the especially rich, or those who didn't have any anthro partners of their own and could forego the expense of an anthro room- but in this day and age, who ever heard of not having an anthro beside them?<br>\r\nSo, you were stuck with some miniscule living quarters built almost as an after-thought into the not-so-miniscule living quarters of your own pet husky. She was living better than you were. Anthros.<br>\r\nYou towel yourself off and brush your teeth, but you've barely picked up your pants before Tundra chimes in, \"The stick, Master Keith!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" You call out. You'd almost forgotten your deodorant. You grab your Old Spice stick and run it over you a few times before getting dressed. It's only after you finished pulling the shirt over your head that you feel the sudden tension of excited expectation in the air. You only get to cry out as you're grabbed under the armpits, hoisted thirty-five feet in the air, and felt a moist, spongy feeling envelop your back. An instant later-<br>\r\n<i><b>SHNNNNNNNNNNNFFFFFF!</b></i><br>\r\n\"TUNDRA!\" you yell, trying to look behind you in her grip.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Keith, it's just... you smell so good with that deodorant on,\" she says with a contented smile. Her pointed ears are especially perky, you can tell.<br>\r\nAnthros.<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, Tundra, you know where classes are,\" You sigh. She would carry you to yours before going to her own. Your book bag in her paw and her own on her back, she cradled you like an infant and opened her own door to the outside. It was embarrassing to be in this pose, but it was ultimately the most efficient way of transport you'd found with her so far.<br>\r\nBesides, you thought as you looked up to Tundra, cradled in the warm, soft, black-and white furs of a giant you considered a sister, a daughter, and a friend all at once... all the complaining said and done, this life was a pretty good one.<br>\r\nBut you'd never tell Tundra that!</span></div></div>",

It was a quaint 'little' cottage on the outskirts of the town. Stones and gravel kicked at your car as you approached the house. You and your dad were worried that with all the winter storms that hit, that perhaps there was structural/roof damage done. And since Dad was still in a cast, this task was left to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door's lock opened after a few tries, the light from outside cascading along the front hallway. It was then that you smelled it... that... dusty... musty... 'sawdust' kind of odor. Your thoughts first went to worried about the water pipes, perhaps they had burst? You stalked down the hall into the living room, and that's when you first see it... the back porch door had been knocked down and the screen door torn apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeezus... had someone broke into the house? That thought crossed your mind as you approached the back of the house. Then you noticed... some feathers... lotsa feathers actually... covering the floor... going in the direction (if your memory was still correct) of the master bedroom. You carefully picked one of these up... and noticed it was quite the large feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now wished you had a crow bar, a tire iron, or even a BIG STICK on you as you slowly walked down the hall leading to said bedroom.

The leg didn't help things either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, not wanting to startle her... you slid up from the ground.

The expression of the Owl turned more somber as she sat on the bed. <br>\r\n\"Really? They were such nice people.\" mumbled the avian forlornly. \"They used to let me stay in the garage during winter. Or, if it was REALLY cold... the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did?\" you replied with a question. \"Why'd they never mention it to us?\" The owl simply shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Those wounds need some attention.\" you say, turning towards the door. \"I got a kit in my car... I'll be right back.\" The big bird simply watched you go without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you got back in the house with the first-aid kit, the owl was trying to limp it's way out the back door. You rushed to her side. \"What the hell are you doing?!\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"Don't need help!\" she snapped... right before falling on her side.<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ!\" you shout as you open the kit, pulling out bandages, gauze and peroxide. <br>\r\n\"LEAVE ME ALONE!!\" screeches the Owl as she tries to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" you reply as you get near her wounded wing. You wetted some gauze with the peroxide and applied it to the cut on her wing. If she wasn't screeching before... the large big was SHRIEKING now from the new burning pain. She immediately threw you off herself, slamming you onto the carpet five feet away.<br>\r\n\"You need some help! You're in no condition to leave!\" you growl as you get back up, determined to help this silly creature. She gasped as you returned to her wounded appendage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! That Hurt!\" she whimpered trying to push you off again.<br>\r\n\"That's because you're already wounded!\" you counter as you apply more peroxide to it, causing the big busty owl to screech again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced yourself for the expected follow-up...  before...</span></div></div>",

She looked down, tail wagging from side to side, waiting for you to say it. \"C'mere girl,\" and on that simple prompt she leaped on you and purred as you hugged her and petted her. It was a bond that would last a lifetime, and a unique one at that, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was a gorgeous tigress, and quite an imposing one at that. Her steely abs immediately made her an imposing figure alone and that's without the fact that she stood at 50 ft tall. Her legs seemed to take up the majority of her height and her breasts were most likely E-cups were she normal sized. Her butt was also quite shapely and just perfect. Her eyes were sensual and seemed to glow beneath her jet black fringe. Her long hair flowed in natural locks. Her long striped tail was wagging from side to side and her smile was both beautiful and a tad scary for others due to her very sharp white teeth. In truth it was love at first sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypically it was rare for someone to own such an exotic animal, especially for you since your family earned an average income, or slightly below average at that. However your family didn't buy Amber from a pet shop, in fact she came to the city to search for her parents, who abandoned her as a baby to live with humans. Eventually she gave up the search and abandoned any hope of finding them, she would have probably just lashed out at them anyway. As she sat alone by the beach however you happened to stumble into her, looking sadly towards the horizon. Though nervous you still chose to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry to disturb you, but is something wrong? You seem pretty sad about something.\" She looked at you glumly and spoke in a deep voice. \"I wanted to meet my parents. I knew they came to this metropolis, but I've looked for so long now. Maybe I should just disregard them. They did to me, abandoned me when I was a mere cub.\" A tear came from her eye, so you instinctively gave her a soft hug on her surprisingly soft abdomen. \"You're right. Forget about them, you deserve more. You deserve a loving family who'll never leave you. If you want, you can come live with me.\" A smile formed on her face and her tail began to wag. \"I would love that... Master. Thank you so much. In the short time I've known you, you've given me more love than anyone else. But I do need a name,\" she said with a sweet smile. You kept gazing at her eyes which were glowing beneath her hair. \"I think Amber would be fitting. Would you like that name?\" you asked, only to receive an eager nod and a tight hug from your new pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then you've both been inseparable from each other. She insisted on sleeping in the same room as you and you only gave her human food; you felt she was far too good for that shit pet food. Both of you being 17, you ended up in a romantic relationship with her. You were always smitten with the beauty that was her. She acted as a guardian towards you and many foes of yours fled in terror before the musclebound tigress. She was certainly the epitome of beautiful but deadly. She would never dare hurt you though. One time she accidentally scratched you and your arm was bleeding a bit but she was apologizing profusely for it. You would never toy with her emotions, as you both respected her too much and were a tad nervous at the potential consequences of messing with her emotions on a serious matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you and Amber were particularly excited as you finally decided to consummate your relationship. During that evening she laid down on her bed in a seductive pose, and you leaped on top of her. The passion was wild. You kissed each other madly in love and you caressed her fine body. You decide to do her anally as her butt was your favorite asset of hers, and you eventually put your dick in her waiting crack. You continued to thrust your rock hard member into her and her moans were almost deafening. After awhile you eventually finished and came right in her ass. She picked you up, smiling and panting a bit and placed between her massive tits. \"It's just as good as everyone says.\" Amber nodded in agreement and you both fell asleep there and then after you both finally lost your virginity.</span></div></div>",

After a long day of hiking with your friends it began to get dark so you chose to set up camp away from your friends after hearing them snore. After a few minutes you had everything set and managed to start a fire. You sat there for awhile to get nice and warm. It was a much colder night than you had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat by the fire though you saw a rather frightening sight. Behind the darkness of the trees you could see two large yellowish-amber eyes staring directly at you. You began to get very nervous at the sight and started to shake. Even more frightening was that the creature was getting closer and was immediately visible to you once it came out of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a massive tigress that appeared right beside you, with the combined physique of a bodybuilder and a supermodel. Her steely abs immediately made her an imposing figure alone and that's without the fact that she stood at 50 ft tall. Her legs seemed to take up the majority of her height and her breasts were most likely E-cups were she normal sized. Her butt was also quite shapely and just perfect. Her eyes were sensual and seemed to glow beneath her jet black fringe. Her long hair flowed in natural locks. Her long striped tail was wagging from side to side and her smile was both beautiful and terrifying due to her very sharp white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down merely a few feet away from you and started to talk. \"I haven't seen a human before in my life. My parents left the forest when I was a baby to be pets to you people,\" she said, her deep voice showing subtle signs of sadness. Hopefully she didn't bear a grudge against humans for it. Then she continued. \"I heard animals like me live wonderful, pampered lives under humans. I can't blame them but I wish I had a lovely owner. I may be strong and independent but... maybe it would be pleasant to be a companion and a friend to someone.\" Her voice thankfully raised in tone and gave off hope that you would offer that opportunity to her. How could you possibly refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you spoke back to her. \"I'd love to have you as a pet, or more appropriately as a companion.\" Her tail began wagging at super speed once she heard that. \"Really? I'd love that. Of course, I need a name. My parents never gave me one and if they did, I never heard it.\" You thought of a name for the lovely feline, and thought of her spellbinding eyes. \"How about Amber?\" you suggested to her, making her eagerly nod in approval. \"A lovely name. Thank you... Master.\" You smiled as you snuggled up to her warm fur, which was incredibly soft, which was surprising considering her abs. Her breasts and stomach were white which nicely complemented her orange and black stripes. \"One more thing Amber. How old are you exactly? Just out of curiosity.\" She immediately answered. \"17, Master. I've had to grow up quick out here but I think I've done OK up to now. How old are you Master\" She was a proud animal and had every right to be. She seemed to look very young as well. \"I'm 17 too. I would have set up camp with my friends a hundred yards from here but I hate snorers.\" You both fell asleep by the fire and arrived home the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set her bed...</span></div></div>",

She put it down in your bedroom next to your bed. \"Why don't you try it out?\" you suggested to her, where she then laid in there and got comfortable. \"It's so comfy. I think I'll take a nap for now. You're welcome to join me if you want.\" You were still a bit tired from having to sleep outdoors so you thought 'why not?'. She took you in her hand and snuggled you up against her midriff, soft and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laid down she had a good grip on you, so even if you wanted to you couldn't get up. A couple of times as well she purred unconsciously and started licking you. Now that you think of it she also did this the previous night when you were camping. You began to get curious of this as an unnerving thought hit you. Cats play with their prey before eating it. You shook her midriff and woke her up, where she looked at you a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you wake me Master? I was having a nice sleep there,\" she asked, a tad irritated. You quickly apologized to your potential predator. \"Sorry Amber, it's just... well there's no easy way of saying this but, you play with me in your sleep and cats tend to play with their prey before eating them. So what I'm asking is are you at any stage going to eat me?\" you asked, incredibly nervous at either a yes or a no. If it's a yes you're done for and if it's a no you just very much offended her by accusing her of something pretty bad that she didn't do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a shocked and saddened look in her eyes. \"No Master, I would never even think of doing that to someone who has given me a home, a new life. I just want to be your friend. I play around in my sleep but that's just me, it's not playing with my prey. If anything it's playing with my friend, my Master.\" She seemed hurt and looked on the verge of tears, so immediately you hug her tight in sorrow and relief. \"I'm so sorry Amber, I didn't know. I just never had a pet before, and certainly never a wild tigress, so I'm new to this. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.\" Amber let out a small smile. \"It's okay, Master. I understand. I will need a bit of time to adjust to my new surroundings, but I'm not going to eat everyone in the city, don't worry. Maybe just this neighborhood,\" she joked, and you shared a laugh. At least she had a sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber then had something else on her mind. \"There is one thing that I might be interested in with you, Master, but it doesn't involve me eating you though,\" she chuckled. \"What's that Amber?\"</span></div></div>",

Rolling over, you bury yourself into the soft white fur of your pet horse, Breeze. You had owned Breeze ever since you were... seven? No, six years old. At the time, she was already a foot or so taller than you. Like most pets who are introduced to their masters or mistresses at a young age, Breeze quickly proved to be rather huggy, taking most opportunities to display her affection towards you, her master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particularly abiding memory you had was from when you were eight years old. During a particularly stormy night, you had tried to fall asleep again and again, failing time after time. Tired and miserable, relief had came in the form of Breeze, who was eight feet tall at the time. Being too large to even fit on your bed, Breeze had pushed your bed away from its usual spot, and coerced you into sleeping on her for the night, meaning that she had effortlessly lifted you out of your bed, grabbed your blanket, and then hugged both you and the blanket to herself in order to function as a living, breathing bed. Since the night in question was a Friday night, Breeze had used the following Saturday morning to trap you within her already larger embrace, the affectionate mare having grown a full foot taller overnight. That morning had been one of the most enjoyable of your entire life, the entire time spent being hugged and nuzzled and licked by the then nine foot tall Breeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was almost thirteen years ago. Breeze had continued to grow... and grow, and grow... But no matter how big she grew, her personality never changed from the sweet and loving mare who liked nothing more than to show her master just how much she loved him. Breeze was currently thirty four feet tall, and if the TV you had watched over the years was true, nowhere near done growing. Breeze would certainly enjoy that, as the white mare had always been ecstatic whenever she grew taller or bustier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Breeze begin to stir underneath you, the massive mare slowly waking up. Deciding to help her, you sprawl yourself on her body and roll around on top of her, the sensation bringing your faithful pet from sleepy to fully awake in a matter of seconds. Picking up your comparitively tiny and fragile form, Breeze brings you close to her muzzle and licks you, before...</span></div></div>",

Gently placing you at her hooves, Breeze stretches out as you rub the soft fur of her ankles. While you wished that she could talk, Breeze was not that lucky, and like most furries, was born without human vocal chords. Finished with her stretching, Breeze once again picks you up, carrying you to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to Breeze, you were around a foot tall, coming up to about halfway between her ankles and her knees when you stood side by side. As Breeze still had quite a bit of growing to do if she wanted to be able to encapsulate your entire body with a single hand, you usually sat in her palm while she carried you, minimising risks of you falling. Today was no exception, although you were quite a bit more bleary than usual on account of it being a Saturday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house itself was built to Breeze's scale, as it was either that or not have a house. You were <i>never</i> getting rid of Breeze. Never. She was too important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that it was almost twelve o'clock due to the clock on the kitchen wall, an unspoken agreement between both of you makes Breeze alter her course, now moving to the living room. If you got up after eleven, you waited to have brunch. Entering the living room, Breeze quickly sits on the sofa, then lays on it and deposits you on her toned, white furred stomach. You lay there for a while, listening to her breathe in and out, before a though crosses your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze was often very affectionate, and recently hadn't had much time to lavish her affections on you. You could let her go at it for a few minutes, or you could simply keep laying there in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you do?</span></div></div>",

The giant creature chasing you might not be able to follow you into these woods, which you're hopeful is so. You glance out from behind the tree, and see the creature looking around, a confused look on its face. Or rather, her face. The creature is a sheep anthro, one of many different species of anthro in this world. She is a rather young individual, and still has a lot of growing to do--even though she's already almost 40 feet tall. You look her over, taking in her form while you wait for her to leave, hoping she will soon get bored and stop chasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has the body of a young girl, although from her waist down she has the legs of a sheep, complete with wool and hooves. She has a small puffy tail too, and above that, there is wool running up her back. Her front is just tan skin, though, without any wool. Her arms and hands are humanlike, except her hands have only three fingers plus a thumb, and her nails are black and similar to the material hooves are made out of. Rings of wool surround her wrists, the only place besides her back and legs to have wool. Moving up to her head, you look at her face, which appears like a mix between a human's face and a sheep's snout. You look at her long black hair tied up in a ponytail, with some left loose to flow over her shoulders and conveniently cover her otherwise bare chest, and note the sheep ears emerging from where human ears would be were she a human. Her big blue eyes are the last thing you note, and you watch them as they look all around, clearly searching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider whether you should run deeper into the woods. You got enough of a head start trying to escape this anthro that you weer able to hide behind this tree without her noticing. But she's bound to find you soon, especially if you don't move. Then again, who knows what wild anthros are in the forest...</span></div></div>",

Besides, there's one reason to not fear this anthro....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheep-girl continues to look around, but her eyes finally fall upon the tree you're hiding behind. You notice that she's looking right at you. Your eyes widen, and you duck behind the tree. You hear her pounding hoofsteps approach, and know that you've lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, deciding to face your fate, and step out from behind the tree. The anthro is just ten feet away from you now, and her shadow covers you. You look up at her, and see that she's smiling widely. She crouches down, reaching out with her left hand. Familiar with this motion, you raise your arms and allow her fingers to wrap around you, gently enclosing you and squeezing you firmly. You're lifted off the ground and raised up to the giant sheep-girl's face ass he stands upright again. She continues to smile, and you start smiling too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Shegragi,\" you say. \"You caught me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro giggles, bringing you close to her and nuzzling you. \"Yay!\" she exclaims. \"I thought I wouldn't be ale to find you! I didn't expect you to go so close to the woods all by yourself! You know that you're only supposed to go there if a dog is there to protect you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Still, it was a good hiding spot. Should you hide now, and I'll look for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my mom didn't want me staying out here too long, so I've gotta get back home. It's been fun playing hide n' seek, though. We should do this again soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree. Well, do you mind carrying me home, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShegragi nods, and begins to walk away from the woods and across the huge fields of your family's farm. Shegragi is one of many anthros you and your family have raised here, a business that's lasted generations. Because of the sheer size of the anthros, very few of them actually need to be slaughtered for food or materials, so you're able to make friends with many of them. It's your job in the family to look after them and make sure they're doing alright, and protect them with your gun if any wild anthros try to attack them. You protected Shegragi like that when she was a baby and just barely bigger than you, so she's since grown very attached to you. Among all the anthros on the farm, she's the one you're closest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carries you through the fields...</span></div></div>",

So it's a surprise when an enormous wolfgirl jumps from among the dense trees around you and lunges at you with her arms outstretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't stand a chance. Her hand paws slam into you, pressing you painfully between them and gripping you tightly. You squirm, but it's no use. You hear giggling, and are lifted up into the air. When you stop moving and can get your bearings, you finally see that you're inches away from the wolfgirl's face. Her face is more animal than human, and is covered in grey fur. It looks just like a wolf's except for the long black hair falling in front of part of it. You glance down, and notice she's naked, but her hair covers her chest conveniently. She must be feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare into her dark blue eyes, suddenly worried. Feral anthros are very dangerous, and can hurt or even kill humans. And this one has you clutched between her hand paws--she can literally do anything to you. You're helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been in this situation. You've only ever been held by friendly anthros, who won't hurt you. You feel very afraid right now, and start to shiver despite the body heat of the Anthro coming through her hands into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" you stammer, \"Don't kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfgirl cocks her head to the side, in a way you would find cute if she wasn't in a position to kil you any second.

She licks her lips, and grins at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her sharp teeth. By now, you've guessed her size to be the same as the sheep Anthro you had been running from.

Where it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're nervous about letting this wolfgirl take you back home. She seems friendly, but wolves and other such anthros have attacked the farm before.

You're pushed into her soft and squishy tongue, in a way that is actually quite comfortable, but it still is not ideal due to the saliva coating you all over, and you close your eyes and mouth tightly to avoid getting it in them.

You live in in a rural area a little ways away from the city, so you have to commute to your job. Its not that big of a hassle, considering it lets you keep your pet comfortable. The open space lets her stretch out and just be herself. The city is well equipped for pets, with most home and apartments being pretty big, but living out here feels better. Speaking of your pet, a booming sound soon starts behind you. A shadow appears over you and you look up to see a huge anthro German Shepherd. She's got dark brown fur, but her paws and ears are black. She's got an athletic build with large breasts. \"Master!\" she says with a smile. She then scoops you up in her paws and licks your body repeatedly. \"Okay, okay.\" you say in between licks. \"Good morning Daisy.\" She stops licking and sets you back down. Her tail wags as you gaze up at her. She's sixty five feet tall but when you got her she was still a little puppy. You were already in you current house so she had a great time growing up with all the space. Now she's extremely loyal and protective of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do today?\" she ask. Its your day off of work and Daisy likes to spend it with you. Lounging around or playing, she just loves being with you. You're about to tell you just want to relax but then you see her face. She's looking down at you with hopeful eyes. You smile with a sigh. \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" you ask. She then starts jumping around excitedly while her tail goes out of control. She snatches you up and hugs you, squishing you into her huge boobs. \"Um, Daisy?\" you say as she smothers you. She notices what she's doing and pulls you away quickly. \"I'm sorry master!\" she says, but also smiles slightly. Thats another thing. Daisy has gotten more flirtatious with you in the last year. Not that you mind. She's a beautiful girl, and you've definitely thought about her in that way at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy holds you in her paws and starts walking off of the property. She has plenty of space as it is but she really likes going out. She walks down the side of the road in a special area for anthros. The world is pretty much equipped for these huge animals since there are so many of them. Cities, towns, roads, sidewalks, everything is made to accommodate the huge pets. Daisy looks around happily as she strolls down the path. She heads toward the city, which doesn't take long thanks to her size, and explores to her heart's content. You even pass a few other people with their pets as you go. Suddenly you come across a stray anthro rooting around in some trash. Its...</span></div></div>",

Her tail darts to and fro as she rummages through the trash. Its not easy either thanks to her size. She has to pick through it with her giant paws and decide whats good enough. \"Not much today.\" she grumbles to herself. Then she notices you and Daisy and backs up with a hiss. \"What do you want?\" she asks rudely. \"Nothing, we were just passing by.\" you tell her. The cat's glaring causes Daisy to hold you closer to herself. \"So I take it you don't have a home?\" you ask. The cat glares some more and grunts. \"Nice observation.\" she says as she inspects her findings. \"Why don't you go to a shelter? They'll help you.\" you suggest. Animal shelters are actually very good, with the world being tailored to these giant creatures. They're well taken care of until they find a home. \"I don't need to be reminded that no one wants me.\" she says. That last part tugs at your heart strings and you make a quick decision. \"How would like to live with us?\" you offer. The cat drops her trash and Daisy almost drops you. \"What?!\" she exclaims. \"Master, why would you even think to let this CAT in our home?\" You try to calm Daisy down. \"She's in a bad spot. Come on, I'm sure you two can be friends.\" The cat however doesn't take to this idea at first. 'Why would you just let me live with you?\" she asks suspiciously. \"I just want to help.\" you say. Man, taking home strays would be easier if they were smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat thinks for a second while Daisy confronts you. \"Master aren't I enough? I'm loyal, right?\" she asks. \"Daisy I love you, there's nothing wrong. I just think she'd be better with us than on the street. Besides, you'd like another friend right?\" you tell her. Daisy pouts while the cat watches your conversation. She grins and walks over. \"I'll take your offer.\" she says and snatches you up. Daisy growls but a look from you stops her. \"By the way, my name's Jenny.\" the cat tells you. Then she hugs you to her face while looking right at Daisy. \"I guess this makes you my MASTER.' she says in a fake lovey voice. Daisy begins to growl again and clenches her paws angrily. Jenny laughs and hands you back to her. \"Relax dog, I'm just kidding.\" she says and joins you on your walk. After a little while the three of you return home. Daisy doesn't take to Jenny at first, but you know she'll come around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the three of you arrive home Jenny looks around a little. \"This place is a lot nicer than the city streets.\" she comments as she inspects the living room. She gets on her knees and sniffs at a tiny (to her) sofa. You have almost two of each piece of furniture. One for anthro size and one human sized. The only exception is the bed, which you've shared with Daisy since she became a giant. \"Yeah well I hope you appreciate it.\" Daisy says as she licks you. Jenny sees the anthro couch and sits down for a second. \"Ooh, this is comfy!\" she says and starts to get comfortable. It pleases you to see her getting settled in, she may start opening up to you sooner than you thought. \"Don't get too comfy, we should show you the rest of the place.\" you tell her. After a tour of the house you head out to the yard. Jenny smells the air and slowly walks onto the grass. As if she can't help herself she begins rolling around and nobbling at at it. At this point Daisy begins laughing and Jenny sits up blushing. \"Shut up! I can't help it if its instinct!\" she yells. \"Sorry, its just so cute!\" you say with a grin. The cat smiles a little at the compliment, while Daisy gives a \"HMPH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stands again and quickly snatches you from Daisy. \"SO what about the rest of the property?\" she asks. \"Well, I own a big yard, but beyond that is just a forest.\" you tell her. \"We've been out there a couple of times, but there's nothing very interesting.\" You all go back inside and settle in the living room. The girls sit on the couch and Daisy sets you atop one of her breasts. \"I gotta say, this is better than I thought it would be.\" Jenny says as she begins to get into the TV show thats on. You climb up Daisy's body and onto the back of the sofa. Then you make your way to Jenny's head and hop on scratching her ear. The cat jolts for a second but you hold on and keep going. \"Hey!\" she says, but then relaxes. \"Uh...thanks.\" she says quietly and actually begins purring. Guess it feels good. After a couple of minutes you sense a piercing gaze and slide down Jenny's body to the cushions. You go to Daisy and begin petting her leg. Her glare becomes a grin and she scoops you up. \"Oh I forgive you! You're just too nice master!\" she gushes as she licks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night its time for bed and everyone is pretty tired. \"We'll get you a bed but until then will the sofa be okay?\" you ask Jenny. \"Are you kidding? It s way better than a bench.\" she answers. While she's still a little guarded you have to say she's made a lot of progress in just a day. As you and Daisy head to the bedroom. She calls out. \"Hey! Um...thank you. Its kind of nice to have friends. I guess.\" she says shyly. \"We're family now.\" you correct her. Daisy begins walking but feels Jenny still standing there. She sighs and turns around. \"How would like to sleep in our room.\" she offers. You look up surprised and then run to hug the dogs breasts, making her jump a little. She's warming up to her! Jenny reluctantly follows the two of you and enters the bedroom. \"Okay, just make sure you stay on your side.\" Daisy instructs as they lie down. You lie on Daisy's boobs and get comfy as Jenny lies on her side. The girls drift to sleep before you and Daisy rolls over, knocking you off to the mattress. This is normal and she's never hurt you while sleeping. Tonight is different however since you have a an extra person. Jenny has manged to roll over closer an start to hugs Daisy from behind. The dog mutters in her sleep but doesn't wake up. Jenny pulls her closer and accidentally scoops you up in the process. In a second she's clutching Daisy's huge boobs with you caught in the middle. You're trapped between a paw and a breast but its actually not that bad. Both are pretty soft and you fall asleep as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Daisy wakes up and notices the paws on her chest. \"Hey! Paws off!\" she shouts and struggles, which wakes Jenny. In a daze the cat rolls around with her, with you getting thrown about as well. When its settled you're in the middle of the mattress with the two of them on either side. \"Sorry, I've never slept with another person before.\" Jenny admits. Daisy huffs and rolls her eyes. \"Okay I'll let it go. Now where's master?\" she says and notices you down below. Then the two of them see that their fur coverings are off and their nethers are exposed. Daisy doesn't think anything because its you, but Jenny goes red and gets up quickly. Then Daisy realizes what just happened. \"Master! Were you ogling her privates?!\" she asks frantically. After everything settles down you're all having breakfast. \"So I think we'll just relax inside today.\" you say and Daisy agrees. \"I think I'll explore the area a little more.\" Jenny says. Turns out she's going to the forest. Later that day...</span></div></div>",

She rubs your head as you rub her belly with one hand. The two of you watch TV and enjoy this calm moment. \"Master, you give the best tummy rubs.\" she says in ecstasy. \"Thanks Daisy.\" you say and rub a little harder. She giggles and picks you up. she drops you on one of her breasts and gives you the puppy dog eyes. \"Can I get a rub here?\" she requests. With a smile you sigh and get to work. She gently moans and pants as you go, and her leg begins to kick. \"This is the life.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour moment is interrupted by a massive rumbling getting closer. Daisy is surprised and hops up in a flash. You almost get flung off but manage to grasp her fur. \"Sorry master.\" she says and takes you in her paw. She makes her way to the door and is almost run over by Jenny. She manages to dodge but you are tossed from her paw in the maneuver. You land on Jenny's back and grab the fur. She feels you and reaches back to get you while panting heavily. \"Sorry.\" she says in between breaths. \"What was that all about?\" Daisy asks. \"You almost hurt my master!\" Jenny rubs your head and gives your hair a lick. Her sand papery tongue makes it stand up. \"Yeah, I'm really sorry. Its just that I found something in the woods.\" she tells you. \"What could it be to make you so freaked?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carries you to the window and holds you up. Daisy also comes over and looks out. \"I think its still around.\" Jenny says. \"I bolted when I saw it but it chased me. Thank god I got inside.\" You keep scanning the yard but don't see anything. \"What chased-\" you say but stop. You finally see what she's talking about.

She's got some muscle under there too, and her breasts are about as big as Daisy's.  She's sniffing around but her eyes are always on the house. Daisy huffs and walks toward the door. Jenny tries to stop her. \"What are you doing?\" she asks. \"Thats a wolf! A wild animal!\" Daisy scoffs. \"I'm just going to talk to her. Besides, if it gets out of hand I can take her.\" she says confidently. You hesitate when she says that. Sure Daisy is plenty tough, but a wolf is different from a dog. You just hope everything goes alright. When she exits the house the wolf looks in her direction. \"Well look at this, I was expecting the kitty cat.\" she says. Daisy walks right up to her calmly. \"Listen, we're both canines so I think we can work this out.\" she says. \"That cat may be a little rude, but she lives with us, so please leave her alone.\" The wolf growls a little. \"Listen doggy.\" she says, which makes Daisy frown. \"The cat wandered into my territory and I wanted a hunt. Besides, seeing her run like that got my blood pumping. Now butt out or I might make you my prey too.\" This gets to Daisy but she tries to stay calm. \"That little human of yours looks pretty tasty too. Maybe I'll have him as an appetizer.\" the wolf adds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger flashes across Daisy's face and she snaps. \"You mangy mongrel! If you even touch one hair on my master's head-!\" she yells. The wolf growls and lunges at her. \"You think you're tough huh? Lets see how tough you are!\" she says. The two of them hit the ground and you fly out of Daisy's paw. \"Master!\" she calls out and looks around for you. \"Don't worry, I'll take care of him. I'm sure he'll taste great.\" the wolf tells her. As if forgetting about looking for you Daisy turns hr attention to the wolf and grapples with her. Meanwhile you've landed in the middle of them and are pressed between their breasts. At least the softness is preventing you from being crushed. As they struggle you slip away and grab at whatever is nearby to stay put. Turns out its one of their nipples and you hear a gasp. Looking up you see that you're hanging from the wolf's breast and she's looking at you confused. She snaps out of it and reaches for you. Daisy, who has also seen you, grabs her arm. \"Don't you touch him!\" she says and grabs you. She's a little over zealous and ends up squeezing you into the massive boob. This is quickly becoming a cat fight. With you in her paw Daisy continues fending off the wolf. Being whipped around is starting to make you nauseous. Suddenly you stop moving when the wolf pins both of Daisy's arms to the ground. Her paw opens slightly and the wolf leans down. \"Get ready little guy, cause Lucy's gonna have you for a snack.\" she says. So her name's Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy bucks wildly and throws Lucy off of her, but also send you flying. a shadow appears overhead and you look to see the gigantic wolf falling on you. She spots you and at the last minute avoids crushing you by shifting before she hits the ground. She misses you but her head collides with the side of the house. It knocks her out and you walk up to her sleeping face. Daisy runs over and snatches you up. \"Oh master I'm so glad you're okay!\" she says. Jenny also runs out. \"Is he okay?\" she asks, then puts on a straight face. \"Just wondering.\" she says nonchalantly, but smiles when she sees you're fine. The two of them look down on Lucy when you cut in. \"Take her in the house.\" you tell them. \"What?!\" they both yell in unison. \"She tried to eat me!\" Jenny says. \"And you!\" Daisy adds. \"But she saved me.\" you say. \"She could have landed on me but avoided it, and she's like this because of it.\" After some convincing your pets carry Lucy inside, grumbling the whole way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside they put her on the sofa. \"Okay Daisy, you make her something to eat. Jenny, find her an ice pack.\" you say. \"Well you're coming too, we're not leaving you with her.\" Daisy says. \"I'll be fine.\" you tell her. \"I think she's good underneath, remember how you were at first Jenny?\" Jenny folds her arms. \"I'm not feral like her!\" the cat spouts. You give them both a look and they begrudgingly go about their tasks. Meanwhile you are standing next to Lucy's face as she sleeps. She yawns and reaches up to scratch her cheek, and inadvertently grabs you in the process. In the span of a couple of seconds she also scratches her thigh and ends up dropping you there. You roll down until you stop in front of her private area. Just like the other girls its huge, bigger than you no question. Suddenly your pets come back and Daisy screams. \"Where is he?!\" Lucy wakes and shoots up, trapping you between her legs. As Daisy and Jenny rush over to her all three of them spot you near the wolf's nethers. All three of them go red. Daisy in anger, and Jenny in surprise. Lucy's blushing because seeing you there sends images through her head. You clinging to her nipple, and her saving you from being crushed. She... </span></div></div>",

Daisy growls, prompting the wolf to growl as well. \"Hold on guys.' you call out. Both of them stop and look at you hopefully. \"Look, Lucy saved me, so I think she's not that bad.\" you say.

Then she looks at Daisy and Jenny. \"I guess I can deal with these two as well.\" she says with a frown. They frown right back and you sigh. This was going to take some getting used to. \"Master why do you keep Bringing more animals home?\" Daisy asks sternly. \"I guess I just have a way with them.\" you say. She sighs as Lucy sits next to her. She's looking at you and eventually speaks. \"Um, can I hold you?\" she asks. Daisy is about to say no but you give her a look. She relents and hands you over to the wolfess. \"So why the change of heart?\" you ask. \"There's just something about you.\" she says as she holds you with a smile. Guess you really do have a way with animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sits down as well and there's an awkward silence. \"So whats it like in the woods?\" she asks. \"Its okay. I know how to hunt so I don't go hungry.\" Lucy answers. Jenny gives her a look. \"What? Just be thankful you got away or you'd be wolf chow.\" Lucy tells her. Looks like even though she's fond of you she still has a long way to go with the other girls. \"So where will I be sleeping?\" she asks. Jenny and Daisy jump up. \"She can't stay here!\" they both say. Lucy looks at you hopefully. \"Well we do have room.\" you say. Your pets are about to protest but you cut them off. \"Come on Jenny, you know what its like to be out without a home.\" She thinks for a second and folds her arms. \"Fine.\" she says begrudgingly. \"And Daisy, just think of it as the family growing.\" Daisy still doesn't look convinced so you motion for her to pick you up. \"Look, you'll always be my cute little puppy so don't worry.\" you tell her. She finally cracks and licks you. \"Okay, fine!\" she says. \"But master is mine!\" The three girls stare at each other as if they were rivals and the day goes on.

From Daisy trying to keep you all to herself, to Lucy trying to get some time with you, then Jenny also wants attention. It makes you wonder why you were never really popular with human girls. Earlier today Lucy and Jenny's beds arrived and now they're moving them to their rooms. It really makes you think though. If this was a world where animals were closer to huam size this house would seem like a gigantic mansion, but really its just built to house many pets. Even with the three you have there's still plenty of room for more. When you go to check on them you see Jenny rolling around on her bed on her back with her arms and legs held up in front her. She must love having her own room. Walking further down the hall you peek in on Lucy, who's sitting up on her bed and hugging her pillow. It makes you smile that they're so happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lucy sniffs the air and looks in your direction. In a flash she rushes over and snatches you up. \"I love my room! Thank you so much!\" she says and licks you a couple of times. She's acting kind of like Daisy, but if you tell her that she'll probably get all huffy. Its weird how she can go from all lovey with you to territorial with the others. She walks you to her bed and drops you down. You bounce when you land and turn to see her on her knees with her arms folded on the mattress. \"Isn't it comfy?\" she asks happily. \"It sure is.' you tells her as you lay back. \"Would it be alright if you slept here with me one day?\" she asks hopefully. You smile as you answer. \"I definitely will but we'll have to work out some kind of schedule. I don't think any of you girls wants the others to have me all to themselves.\" Her tail wags and she licks you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming sound approaches and you see Daisy coming in. \"There you are master!\" She walks over and she and Lucy glare at each other. They may not really get along but they've learned to keep their cool. \"I was just showing him my room. Its the best isn't it?\" Lucy says excitedly. \"Uh yeah.\" Daisy says rolling her eyes. \"Lunch is ready so lets go.\" Daisy says. Lucy carries you to the kitchen behind Daisy. You have to say Daisy is getting better at letting others hold you. You're proud of her, having new animals move in so suddenly couldn't have been easy for her. Lucy sets you on the table and Daisy sets down a tiny plate. Its fried chicken, which you happily dig in to. Daisy, Jenny, and Lucy all have bowls of animal food. Despite walking and talking like people they still eat kibble and such. Even if livestock was huge, the world would still run out of food if the animals ate it, so pet food was created. From what you see it must taste pretty good as they munch it down happily. \"So what do you have planned for today?\" Jenny asks as she rubs your head. \"Well you guys can join me if you want, but I was planning on going to...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll get to see some exotic felines.\" You look over at Lucy. \"How about you?\" you ask. \"I'm in!\" she says excitedly. You smile at her response. Some people will probably be a little surprised if you have a wolf walking around with you. Some animals, like wolves and bears, tend to keep to themselves. They aren't usually kept as pets. Hell, the only reason you have Lucy is because of your uncanny ability to attract animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you all leave Daisy carries you, telling the others that she has seniority. When you reach the zoo you enter and decide where to go first. \"Where should we start?\" you ask. Looking at a mp you see that there are many places to choose from, but ultimately you just settle on whatever is closest. Turns out its a sloth exhibit. Looking inside you several huge anthro sloths lazily laying in the trees. Some are sleeping, others are eating, and some are looking out at the zoo goers. One of them yawns as she pushes her hair out of her eyes and spots you through the glass. She winks at you and blows you a kiss before going back to sleep. Further down you see a habitat for hippos. They are naturally fatter than other anthros and all of them have huge racks, even by anthro standards. As one emerges from the water you can't help but stare as the water drips off of her wet body. Daisy covers you with a paw and turns away. \"I think we've seen enough of the hippos.\" she says. Jenny and Lucy nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you come across the giraffes, and wow are they impressive. They're taller than any other anthros you've ever seen thanks to their necks. They walk around they habitat picking leaves off of the trees to eat. One of them bends her neck down out of the exhibit and gives you a kiss before quickly retreating. \"Hey!\" Daisy says to the giraffe, who walks away nonchalantly. They also lounge around and even have a radio to listen too. Thats the thing about zoos. Since animals are so human like they can't just sit around all day without getting bored. The zoos provide them with the means to stay entertained so they can live comfortably. There's one exhibit where the coyotes are playing cards, and another where alligators have a jacuzzi. The next exhibit you visit is...</span></div></div>",

One of them has spines so big they look like a mohawk on her head. In another tank are many gecko women who are relatively small compared to the iguanas. They look like they're having fun darting back in forth, racing each other in the tank. Daisy holds you up to the tank to get a better look and one of the geckos notices. She runs up to the glass where you are and presses her face against it. You wave hello and she blows you a kiss. After she retreats from the glass Daisy moves to the next tank. \"Master what is it with you and animals?\" she mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you also see the turtle tank. The girls in here all have big shells on their giant bodies. You wonder if its uncomfortable for them. They all look pretty content lounging under the giant sun lamp they have in their tank. The next exhibit you see has some bigger reptiles. Its the alligators in their giant jacuzzi. In addition to the jacuzzi they also have a normal pool of cool water. A couple of them emerge from the pool and walk up to the glass to flirt with you. Their scaly bodies glisten as the water drips off and their breasts look really soft with the rest of their underbellies. They smile and wink at you until Daisy once again turns away. \"Daisy, its  not like I'm flirting back. You don't have to do that every time.\" you say. Daisy sighs. \"I know, but for some reason it still gets to me.\" she tells you. \"Look on the bright side, at least I can't take any of the zoo animals home.\" you say. \"Hey don't jinx it.\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last reptile tank you come across is the most impressive yet. Inside is a komodo dragon woman lying on her side lazily. As the largest living species of reptile she's much bigger than the other reptiles in the zoo. She's also larger than any of your pets. Her thick thighs and gigantic breasts catch your eye and she sees you staring. She smiles at you and you give one back. Above you Daisy lets out a \"hmphh!\". Lucy and Jenny are also giving you the eye. \"Uh, sorry.\" you say. The komodo dragon resumes her lounging but still watches you with one eye as your group leaves. Where do you head next?</span></div></div>",

She runs over to the glass of one exhibit and peers inside. There are a few slim cheetah women who are racing around the area. \"Wow! Look at them go!\" she says in wonder. Then all of you head to the next exhibit, which contains the leopards. These girls have sort of thick bodies and are lazing about at the moment. One is napping at the base of a giant tree, and a couple others are lounging up in the branches. Jenny points happily and smiles at you. \"This is pretty cool huh?\" she asks. \"You bet it is.\" you tell her, happy that she's having fun. Daisy and Lucy also can't help but smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two exhibits are the most impressive of the cats. The first one contains a lioness, whose fur seems to shine in the sunlight. She's got a huge voluptuous body with great hips and boobs, and is easily as big as the komodo dragon woman from before. Jenny waves at her and she waves back with a smile. Then the lioness sees you in Daisy's paws and gives you a seductive look. She winks at you and blows a kiss, prompting Daisy to turn away. As you walk away she still looks in your direction. Next you see a tiger woman right next to the lioness cage. She's got about the same build as the lioness and is just as sexy. Jenny once again waves and receives one in return to her pleasure. She turns to you and squeals. \"Can you believe it? The two most famous cats right here!\" she says. Just like with the lioness the tigress flirts with you and Daisy turns the other way. Lucy also seems to be getting a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that last exhibit you all decide to head home, as its getting a little late. \"You know, I kind of see where Daisy is coming from.\" Lucy says on the way back. \"Whats up with all these girls coming onto you?\" You shrug. \"I just have a way with animals. Don't forget you're kind of like them.\" you tell her. Lucy blushes with a grin. \"Yeah, but I won you over. I doubt any of those zoo animals will be coming home with you.\" Daisy nods in agreement and nuzzles you to her face. Jenny and Lucy lean in to get in on it, then continue home. Little did you know that an escape is in progress at the zoo. Who got out?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sighed, looking down at the ground, and was pondering wether or not to take a nap to help her forget, if only briefly, the human and his warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst!! Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness turned to face the voice, and saw her tigress neighbour and friend, Nadine, hands on her wide hips. \"I'm bustin' out of this place, you coming with?\" She asked with a mischievous smirk curling her lips. Her smirk didn't last long however, given her friend's surprised expression. \"Ugh! Come on, Abby! I'm sick of this place and I know you are too! Besides, I saw the way you were looking at that guy, and to be honest, I feel the same way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, the lioness brought her hands to her mouth, visibly embarrassed. \"N-Nadine! I-I did not! I was just being friendly to him and his friends! Don't be ridiculous!\" Abby turned her face with a pout, crossing her arms over her large bosom. Smirking yet again, Nadine started teasing her friend again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Then I'll be a pink elephant with wings if that wink and that kiss were meant for the girls that were with him.\" Still pouting, Abby turned to her friend and glared at her. \"Look, you've been sighing like that for the last twenty minutes or so, since he left. I've known you since we were cubs, and I want you to be happy, so the way I see it, the sooner we find that hunk, the sooner you'll feel better. I don't even mind sharing!\" Looking away, she quietly murmured. \"...plus, all those sighs were kinda getting on my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can hear you quite well, don't you?\" The lioness replied, rolling her eyes at Nadine's toothy grin. After a lengthy pause, Abby decided. \"Alright, I'm in. But are you sure about this? I mean, once we're out, the Zoo staff will be looking for us, and if they catch us we could be in big trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much, dear. I have a plan to get us outta here AND another one to keep us hidden. Trust me.\" Leaning closer to the cage bars, Nadine beckoned her friend to come closer. \"Now listen carefully, here's what we're gonna do...\" And the two thick felines began to plot their escape...</span></div></div>",

When you finally get home everyone begins to wind down from the day. \"I'm gonna go take a nap.\" Jenny says and goes to her room. Lucy heads to the living room and checks to see what's on TV. \"Well I think I'll take a shower.\" Daisy says. \"Okay, just set me down here.\" you tell her. She puts you on the kitchen counter and heads to the shower as you decide to have a snack. She put you on the counter near the fridge so you head over to the side of it. Houses equipped for pets have huge fridges for the pets to open, but there are also ways for humans to get in. You enter the small door on its side and walk inside. Its really cold so you grab a quick slice of cake and exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand on the counter and eat your cake a rumbling occurs and a shadow falls on you. You assume its one of the girls but little do you know that Lucy has fallen asleep on the couch, Jenny is napping, and Daisy is still showering. You turn to look up at two women who are even bigger than your pets. Its the lion and tiger from the zoo! You back up slightly and the tigress bends down so her face is directly in front of you. \"Hey there handsome.\" she says and proceeds to lick your entire body. Her sand papery tongue tongue presses you into the counter and you end up getting stuck to it. When she looks at the lioness she grins. The lioness looks a little hesitant but her friend moves in closer and grabs her. She pulls her in for a kiss and the two of them start making out while playing with you in their mouths. You are tossed about and grabbed by both of their tongues. Your whole world is a cave filled with hot breath and saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally break their kiss you are caught on a strand of saliva when they separate. You fall down and realize that they're so close they have their breasts pressed up against one another. You land on the two pairs of mammaries and bounce until you come to a stop. \"Sorry for intruding but we saw you at the zoo and just had to find you.\" the tigress. says. \"I'm sorry, but there's just something about you. You're too cute!.\" the lioness agrees. \"By the way, my name is Nadine.\" the tiger says. \"And I'm Abby.\" says the lion. As the two of them hug with you in the middle, you try to figure out how you'll explain this. They just look at you smiling as their tails swish. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

You look to see her in the doorway fresh from her shower. She's got a look of surprise and a little bit of fear on her face. \"Oh hello. We got bored with the zoo so we thought we'd find a new place to stay.\" Nadine tells her nonchalantly. \"What are you talking about? Where's my master?\" Daisy says frantically and then spots you. Seeing you between their boobs sets her off and she begins growling. Soon she's across the room ready to pounce but Nadine stands up straight with her hands on her hips. Daisy stops and looks up at her, realizing just how big she is. Abby watches on with you in her paws. \"Look girls, just calm down.\" you say out loud. \"Oh we're calm. Its sparky here who's freaking out.\" Nadine says. \"Master! What are they doing here?\" Daisy demands to know. \"I honestly don't really know myself.\" you answer truthfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain.\" Nadine says. \"Me and my friend Abby here took quite a shine to your little master here. So much so that we decided to come and find him!\" Abby nods as cuddles you to her cheek. \"I don't care. Just give him back and get out!\" Daisy says. With that she stomps over and attempts to grab you but Nadine snatches you away first. \"Don't be like that.\" she says and holds you out of Daisy's reach. Daisy is getting madder and when Nadine gives you a lick she loses it. Throwing caution to the wind she jumps on the larger tigress and topples her over. Nadine manages to keep you safely in her grip as the two of them struggle on the ground. \"Hey, watch it or you might hurt him!\" Abby says as she walks over. Daisy stops in concern but Nadine laughs. \"Oh he's fine, now get in on this.\" she says and pulls the lioness to the floor with them. This sudden move causes the three of them to get even more tangled up and you feel Nadine's grip loosening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daisy attempts to grab you Lucy ends up walking in on you all and stops in surprise. \"What the hell is going on/\" she asks, looking from one girl to the next. \"They broke in and took master!\" Daisy tells her. \"Now help me!\" Lucy doesn't quite understand but knows she wants to get you from these newcomers and jumps into the fray. As the little rumble grows Jenny walks in sleepily. \"Hey guys whats-\" she begins before tripping over the four girls and ending up joining in. Meanwhile Nadine finally loses hold of you and you find yourself falling into a sea of giant furry bodies. You're thrown to and fro between their giant forms. Honestly you think it feels kind of great.</span></div></div>",

And why are you always caught in the middle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was...fun. Reminds me... of back when we were cubs, remember, Abby?\" the tigress laughs, slowly sitting up and looking at her fellow escapee. Abby, however, wasn't as amused. \"You used to play rough and you were more straightforward then I was.\" Nadine winks at the lioness, who blushes and looks away, flustered. You notice this, and find her innocent behaviour to be endearing, somewhat, but a puff from Daisy brings you back to the situation at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master... please call the zoo keepers... To...huff... take them back.\" She rises groggily, her chest heaving and shaking as Daisy regains her composure, and both Nadine and Abby give her a serious look. Feeling the pressure from their gaze, and remembering the two big cats were bigger than her, she recoils. \"O-or just kick them out! This house is already crowded enough as it is!\" Lucy and Jenny perk up, their ears twitching when they were mentioned. You ponder for a bit, feeling the girls stare at you intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no.\" Daisy's ears droop and she lowers her stare to the ground, while Jenny just moans and rolls her eyes. Lucy on the other hand seems glad, a sentiment shared by the two felinr intruders. \"It's already late.

Daisy reaches down and rips your clothes off. \"Almost forgot, we can't do anything with those on.\" she says. You step forward at full mast and enter her cave. While you're way too small to do anything normally, you can still stimulate her nonetheless. Without delay you begin rubbing your rod against any surface you can find in here, causing her to buck like crazy outside. Daisy is busy as well. She's got one paw teasing her nipple and the other working her clit. As the both of you keep going you find yourselves reaching the end. When it finally happens you shoot your load inside but it seems like nothing compared to her's. It comes at you like a flood and you are washed out onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy picks you up and starts licking you clean while panting. \"Thank you so much master!\" she says with tears in her eyes. \"I love you, I love you so much!\" When she's done giving you tongue she lays you between her boobs and drifts off to sleep. You do the same and sleep happily. </span></div></div>",

At first you assume its Daisy's but then you notice the color. Daisy's paws are black, but this one has orange fur. Suddenly you realize who it is. For some reason Nadine snuck into Daisy's bed! Daisy begins to wake up as well and feels the tigress. When she opens her eyes to see Nadine in her bed, with her paw between her boobs, she is less than happy. \"What are you doing!?\" she shouts, waking Nadine up. The tigress yawns and sits up. \"Morning.' she says nonchalantly. \"What are doing in my bed?!\" Daisy repeats. Nadine rubs her eyes. \"I guess I wandered in here while I was sleeping.\" she says. \"Oh thats Bull!\" Daisy tells her. \"At least I waited for you to finish.\" Nadine says. Daisy and you both go red. \"Come on I can smell it. I'm pretty sure everyone else will too.\" Nadine says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just get out. We're getting up anyway.' Daisy says with a sigh. Nadine giggles and leaves, waving her tail at you as she does. Daisy gets up with you in her paw and follows. \"Lets get some breakfast.\" she says and heads to the kitchen. When you arrive you see that everyone else is already there. Jenny and Abby are drinking coffee and Lucy is eating some cereal. \"Good morning.\" Lucy says to you. Her nose twitches for a second and she gasps. \"You two did it!\" she says. \"Congratulations!\" Abby says. \"Whatever.\" Jenny says. \"Well its only right. I am number one.\" Daisy gloats, puffing out her chest. \"Yeah we get it.\" Nadine says, sticking her own chest out. She presses her boobs against Daisy's as if to prove who is bigger. After they stare each other down for a second Daisy starts making breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think we should get down to business.\" Nadine says. \"Can we stay?\" Everyone looks to you. Abby has a hopeful expression on her face. \"Are you sure?\" you ask. \"You'll be leaving you're comfy life at the zoo.\" Nadine waves a paw. \"That was getting kind of boring. Besides, we've already fallen for you.\" she says. Abby nods and pleads with her eyes. \"Okay.\" you tell them. The big cats hug each other and Nadine snatches you up. She and Abby cover you in kisses until you stop them. \"Guys, I have to go to work.\" you say. They put you down and you eat breakfast before heading to your car. You really only use it for work. Any other time Daisy just carries you. You drive away leaving the girls by themselves. When work is over...</span></div></div>",

You fall back in shock and look up to see a giant orange paw. Looks like Nadine came to greet you. She's standing over you with a smile and she's licking her lips.\"Uh, hey Nadine.\" you say. She lowers her paw to the floor and you climb aboard so she can lift you to her face. \"Hey there, I was waiting for you to get home.\" she says. \"What do you need?\" you ask, and she starts walking. \"I was looking through the place and found the room I want. You have a pretty big house. How does one guy afford it?\" she asks. \"I actually lucked out.\" you explain. \"The old owner had a lot of pets, but she moved away. We were pretty good friends so she let me buy it from her at a super cheap price.\" Thinking back you realize how lucky you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that Nadine has stopped walking and look round at the room she's in. \"Okay, if you like this one we can have your bed ordered.\" you tell her. \"Thanks, but until then I found this.\" she says and shows you a couple of blankets she spread onto the floor. You start to talk again but she drops you onto a pillow. When you pick yourself up you see her once again staring down on you licking her lips. She looks like she just cornered some prey. Then it hits you. You didn't even hear her coming when you got home. That would only be possible if she was trying to conceal herself. You wonder what she wants when she speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me and Abby really do like you.\" she says as she lowers herself to the floor. She's on all fours and has her face close to you. \"That kiss we had when we first met was great but I'd love to take it a little further.' she says seductively. You gulp and scoot back a little.  \"Come on, its not like it won't happen eventually.\" she says. \"All of us love you, so you're going to have to satisfy us all.\" You know she's right but you didn't expect this so suddenly. Guess you and Daisy made her a little jealous. Nadine licks you a little before pouncing, but what happens?</span></div></div>",

You look up and see that she's propping herself up with her gigantic breasts right above you. She begins to move back and forth, making them sway gently. You were a little nervous at first but the huge boobs above you are kind of mesmerizing. So much so that you almost don't notice them lowering onto you. The mountains of flesh get closer and closer until they're upon you. You hold out your arms instinctively in a futile attempt to stop them but your hands sink into the soft furry orbs. \"I knew you couldn't resist groping them.\" Nadine says from above. She lowers them further until you are pressed against the floor, then lifts them again. You sit up to see them coming back, but this time her nipple is headed right for you. It collides with you and holds you against the ground. \"Grab on.\" Nadine purrs. You decide that this is happening one way or the other, and it would have happened eventually, so you do as you're told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cling to the massive nub with both arms and Nadine gasps a little. You find yourself speeding upwards as she sits up. It also seems to be getting harder to keep your grip. You then notice that her nipples are becoming erect, so they're too big for you to grab. Instead you clutch her nipple flesh tightly in each hand, making her jolt in pleasure. \"Oh!! Thats wonderful!\" she exclaims. You get a chance to look downward and see one of her paws going to work on her pussy. The other is clutching the breast you're on and guiding it to her mouth. Her gaping maw opens and you are plunged into darkness as she begins to lick her own tit. The giant tongue play around with you in total darkness, rolling you around and pressing you into the nipple. When she releases her boob you appear to be stuck to her nipple. \"Mmmm...that was great.\" she says lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself being peeled off of the nipple by Nadine's giant fingers and tossed back onto the blanket. Her massive shadow looms overhead and you see her preparing to pounce again. She leaps at you and you can't help but flinch again. This time however before you even look you are assaulted by a strong aroma. You look to see that her huge vagina is right above you. A glob of her juice drips down onto you, coating you in her essence. Nadine grins as she lowers herself onto you. When her pussy touches down you stick to it like glue. She turns over and lies on her back while you struggle. She bites her lip in pleasure and decides to help you along. Her paw comes down and begins to press you further inside. \"Okay lover, this is it!\" she tells you between moans. \"Lets finish it!\" You shake your head but also smile as you are forced all the way inside. You remove your clothes and proceed to stimulate her. After a little while the area tightens and you are expelled from Nadine, landing in a puddle of fluid with your clothes. The tigress grabs you and licks you clean, humming and purring as she does so. \"That was awesome!\" she says giddily. You smile at her and nod. \"Yeah, I guess it was.\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your clothes drenched in tiger juice Nadine has to sneak to your room to get a new set. This could be hard since you share a room with Daisy. You're either going to get away with it so you can explain things later, or get caught in the act. Which is it?</span></div></div>",

Nadine's face is closely watching as you change. \"Uh...can I help you?\" you ask. She giggles and knocks you over with a finger. \"Don't tell me you're feeling shy after what we just did!\" she says. You pick yourself up and resume getting dressed. \"No, its just kind of...unnerving when someone watches you like that.\" you tell her. She continues to observe you and you roll your eyes. When you finish she snatches you up and heads to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and Lucy are lounging on the couch when you get there. \"When did you get home?\" Lucy asks happily when she sees you. \"Oh, I got back a little while ago.\" you say. \"He was helping me with something.\" Nadine adds. The two of them go back to watching TV and soon you hear someone else coming. Abby comes out of the kitchen with some drinks. She sees you and Nadine when she enters. \"Oh! I didn't see you two earlier!\" she says as she hands Jenny and Lucy their drinks. \"We were a a little busy.\" Nadine tells her. You know can't tell if she's playing it cool or dropping hints. Then Daisy walks in from the kitchen with a bowl of chips. \"Oh there you are!\" she says and sets the bowl on the coffee table. Then she snatches you away from Nadine and sits down in an arm chair. The tigress rolls her eyes and sits on the couch with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is watching TV and actually bonding when Nadine speaks up. \"Hey guys, I think I should tell you something.\" she says. Everyone looks at her and you have a feeling what she's going to say. \"Unless you want to tell them.\" she says to you with a smile. When the focus shifts to you you sigh. \"Okay...when I got home from work Nadine took me to her room. One thing led to another and....\" you explain. For a second everyone looks shocked but then they react in different ways. \"What? She got you before me?\" Lucy says jealously. \"Good going!\" Abby tells her friend supportively. Jenny looks away. \"Whatever.\" she says, but her cheeks are a little red. You look up to Daisy to see how she's taking it but you're pleasantly surprised. She doesn't look mad. \"She looks down on you and sighs. \"Just remember who your number one is.\" she says and gives you a couple of licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that thats out of the way, what next?  </span></div></div>",

Looking around, you can see the ceiling of your bedroom hundreds of feet above you, and to your right and left, two large hills that gave away exactly where you were. Glancing up, you gaze upon the peaceful, sleeping face of your pet Tyrannosaurus Rex, Astra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her gargantuan form, you think back to when you first met Astra. When you were four, your parents brought home the purple scaled Astra to serve as a playmate and pet for you. Her parents had both passed away shortly after she was born, and she was ecstatic when she was finally adopted. The two of you bonded instantly, and pretty soon Astra and you were inseparable as you played together in most of your free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, those feelings only grew along with Astra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you were ten, Astra was thirty feet tall. When you entered high school, Astra topped one hundred and fifty feet. And now that you've graduated college and were living on your own, Astra was an astounding five hundred and four feet tall, one of the tallest pets you've ever seen. At least she had finally stopped growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her height, Astra had also matured into a gorgeous young woman over the years. If she were the size of a human, her breasts would have easily been an H-cup in size, and her butt was similarly massive. Sometimes, out of the corner of your eye, you could see Astra staring at you with a lustful look in her eyes - you figured she had feelings for you, but she hadn't acted on them. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you lived alone with Astra in a house that was designed for tall pets out in the countryside. While you did have your own bed that was designed for someone of your size, more often than not, you woke up lying on top of Astra, who would either force you to sleep with her or would snatch you up in the middle of the night. Honestly, you've probably slept on her for more nights than you've ever slept on a regular bed. Not that you don't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fondly think back on your memories of Astra, the massive form of the T-Rex begins to shift under you. Before long, a large claw that is easily twice your size gently picks you up and brings you towards the gigantic face of your pet. Astra's lips draw back in a toothy grin before she softly kisses you with a mouth that could easily swallow a house whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Master,\" Astra's sultry voice rumbles. \"I hope you had a pleasant sleep on the softest bed in the world!\"</span></div></div>",

The tall woman peeked out from behind the kitchen door in that cute way she did and smiled a warm smile.  She was dressed in an apron, tied behind her back to accentuate her thin and voluptuous form.  With her long, blonde hair tied up into a bun, it was easy for Tania to see the blue of sweet icing frosting the corner of her mouth as she ran up to give the young woman a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie!\"  Blue eyes closed, shoulders were squeezed, and a gentle kiss was planted on beaming cheeks.  \"Did you have fun with your dad this summer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did!  We spent almost every day at the beach and went to Disneyland, like, five times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania leaned back to better see her mother's face over the shelf of her large and firm breasts.  She excitedly told the story of living with her dad these last six weeks.  For her part, Blondie listened dutifully to her daughter, nodding appropriately and laughing when at the right moments.  The split between the parents had been amicable, Charles had gotten away from a bored and unloving wife and she had gotten enough money to live comfortably for the rest of her life.  Finally the beautiful child calmed down and Blondie stood back up to her full height with smooth hands on her trim hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm amazed you can stand, let alone talk after all of the fun it sounded like you had.  Welcome home, my little angel.\"  Tania beamed cutely in response, a small gap apparent in her smile where a baby tooth had lost its struggle a few weeks prior.  \"You know the drill, up against the door frame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six year old slipped off her sandals, wiggling her long toes and obediently stood up straight against the wall.  The top of her head was just a little bit above the top pencil mark and Blondie scribbled a new line above to mark her daughter's new height after six weeks of being apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like just a bit more than 3'10\".  You're getting tall, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I get a cupcake now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a smart one, knowing what treats I have for your homecoming,\" her mother smirked.  She suddenly nibbled her lower lip, glancing upward from the corner of her eye with a wicked look.  \"Why don't you wait for the frosting to set, there's another present waiting for you in your bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I'd leave my precious girl empty-handed after being gone for so long, do you?\"  Blondie nodded upward, sticking her chest out a bit in pride as she smiled.  \"Why don't you get to know your present while I get dinner ready.  These cupcakes will be here for us for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was off like lightning, leaving her mother to bring in her bag and close the front door after her.  Thankfully, her ex-husband had already driven off, beginning the three hour ride home as she glanced outside.  It was nice to hear the soft thudding of feet again as they trounced upstairs.  Blondie was only able to see her little girl's pigtails as she turned the corner before she thought to call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be down in an hour, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania opened the door as her eyes immediately falling upon the large box resting atop her bed.  It was a simple thing, wrapped in a bow with a removable top.  She was already excited to say the least, but what really got her attention were the large holes cut into the sides for air.  Trying to peek through to venture a guess at the contents, she quickly jumped on the bed and whipped it off with a gasp and smile as she saw the beautiful and clean puppy laying down sleeping at the bottom of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cry of excitement snapped the cute thing to attention.  His brown eyes opened up and he quickly leapt to his feet.  He was maybe half of Tania's height, his fur a soft and golden brown with a lighter white across his front.  Ears stood proudly atop his head while large hands gripped the edge of the box.  A pink tongue lolled out from his small muzzle, his panting happy as the thick column of his tail wagged from the small rump behind him, and he yipped.  The girl quickly hugged him and he nuzzled warmly against her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A puppy!  Thank you, mom!  He's wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding him away from her with long arms, she got a good look at her new pet.  His arms bunched upward from broad shoulders as he hung limply.  Legs were toned in boyish muscle before ending in large paws for feet.  Tania put him on the ground and he wobbled slightly, trying to stand up normally before falling forward.  She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still learning to walk, huh?  You'll learn soon enough.  I think I'll call you, Scamp.  Do you like, woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was on top of her, licking her face and nuzzling against any bare skin he could find.  Her laughter mingled with his playful yips and barks and the two rolled around on the floor for what felt like forever until the little girl was sure that they would be best friends forever.  Scamp was warm and soft and he smelled like love.  She scratched him behind his ear, just under his chin, and right above his excited tail, Tania couldn't help but love how his little butt flexed and twitched as she did so.  He gave her one more lick on the neck, pressing his wet nose against her cheek, when her long fingers found his belly and began to tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScamp immediately fell onto his back, wiggling back and forth under her care.  His tongue kept hanging from his muzzle, his teeth playfully nipping her as he enjoyed the sensation, but he quickly stopped moving as he felt a new sensation.  It was a pleasant feeling as his new and beloved master was suddenly playing with the small weight that dangled between his thin legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, boy?  I don't have one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania's eyes furrowed as her fingers brushed up against the soft tube of flesh that was draped over a smooth and round sack.  Scamp got real quiet, only giving out a little bit of a whimper, before spreading his legs further while the child explored.  She gripped it gently, noting a squishiness there, but also something firm just beneath.  Her dog's heart was beating, she could feel it in the tips of her fingers and she marveled at how his fur seemed shorter here, yet just as soft and velvety as the rest of his body.  The sack was large, filling her palm with it's size, and she could see that it contained two round, ball-like shapes that rolled and bounced as she played with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScamp whined again, scooting a little forward to help Tania's curiosity along as he closed his eyes.  Her attention went again to the column of warm flesh that was curving out from his crotch.  She turned and looked at it, fascinated by the wrinkled skin and the curved shape of the tip.  But, as time went on, she realized that it was pulsing and throbbing, pushing outward at he fingers as it tried to force them away and her eyes went wide in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting ... bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six year old's mouth was open in awe as the bulbous head swelled bigger, becoming shinier and a deeper shade of purple.  It straightened, trembled and flexed, and kept growing longer.  All the while, Tania could feel how it was getting stiffer, straighter, and ever more hotter.  When it fully extended, she found she could barely get her fingers to touch, even though she had fairly big hands.  Even encircled by her as it was, it still stuck out a few inches passed the edge of her palm while the heel of her palm rested comfortable against Scamp's fleshy base and that sack.  She looked up with a giggle, seeing her puppy's lucid expression, obviously pleased with what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that feel good boy?  You like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently tugging up, feeling how hard it was now just below the satin skin, Tania gently caressed the rim below the head, eliciting another whine of satisfaction from her pet.  She nibbled her lower lip, unaware of exactly what she was doing, and continued to play with Scamp's erection...</span></div></div>",

Soon enough Tania had to start using both hands just to continue and even then her fingers could not touch, scamps cock was about a foot llong now. Scamps cock was not the only thing that was growing, all of scamp was growing aswell in fact . Scamps body had now rocketed up to 4 feet tall, his arms started to fill out with muscle as well as his legs. His stomach began to show a firm rock hard 6 pack and his chest started to push out producing 2 huge strong pecs, his balls were the size of tinias head now. Finally scamp wined as his cock started to jet out cum all over the floor and tanias face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww what's this. It's sticky, and tasty. Yum.\" Tania said as she began to lick of the sweet white sticky liquid.<br>\r\n Scamps then stood up on his hind legs, wobbled a bit but them stood proud. It seems his new muscle made it Easy for him now. Scamp walked yup to Tania and began to help her clean up by licking her up and down. Scamp was taller then her now and Tania wondered how big he could get. Scamp then began to puch her to the floor as he licked all over her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste so good,  you are so nice by helping me absorb my food, thank you yummy friend.\" Scamp said. Waging his tail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. But not while I was so small, when I was finally able to absorb my food it I gains the ability to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food what food\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people before feed me a nice treat before puting me in that box. He was a good treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait he? Your treat was a person?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup he was nice and tasty. He was so yummy going down my throught and it felt so nice as he wiggled in my tummy. He eventually stoped and gave up while we were in the box and them you came and helped me. It felt so good when you helped me. My cock felt good as well my tummy as I felt him get absorbed into me. I like it. But don't worry I won't absorb you. You helped me so I like you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania breathed a sigh of relief in hearing that her puppy didn't want to hurt her. Scamp was just a puppy right. And if he ate some one that's just because he was just hungry it's not his fault. Just then scamps stomach made a loud gurgling sound and his balls churned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry\" moaned scamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door rang.</span></div></div>",

The boy was blond and thin but had some definition on his legs. The boy also had a name tag on his shirt that said food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm here to feed your new pet. I'm the first of several other volenteers come to feed your dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean scamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScamp sprinted on all fours at the sound of his name. Then stood up looking at the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh are you scamp? It's nice to meet you. I hope you are hungery because I am ready so serve you young puppy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yay food is here. I was so hungery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy walked in, closed the door and layer down smiling. Scamp them walks up to the boy and opens his mouth huge like a snake and the boys head is now In scamps mouth. The boy seemed aroused by being consumed by this powerful puppy. With another gulp sends the boy in the dogs mouth up to his shoulders and the boys hand scamp begins to get hard as the boy begins to squirm in his mouth. Another Biko and the boys chest is pulled in. At this point scamp sits up and tilts his heat up allowing gravity to help pull the boy towards scamps stomach. Yet anothe gulp and only the boys legs can be seen and they begin to flail. This makes scamp go in a state of incredible pleasure as he feels his prey will glue in him. The last gulp pulls the rest of the boy into scamps stomach where surprisingly has not grown to the size of the boy, it must be magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScamp says \"hey friend can you help me again. He feels so good wiggling in my belly but I need you to pleasure me again please.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tania gives scamp a blow job she witnesses him begin to grow. Scamp begins to grow to 6 feet tall, his muscles grow with him as his biceps become the size of basketballs, his abs become ever more firmer and turns into an 8 pack. His legs grow thick and pulsate with muscle, his pecs inflate untill each are larger then watermelons, scamps balls grow so huge that they start to hang past his legs and spread them apart a bit. Lastly scamps cock begins to grow and right before they it grows too big Tania takes her mouth off getting a full face of cum. Scamps cock is now as thick as her and is just over 5 feet long. Scamp begins to pant as he relieved himself of his cum. All scamp can think about now is the ever growing hunger that he has, every time he absorbs another person he gets even hungeryer. Scamps loves the power he gets, he loves his muscles, he loves being the Alpha muscle god that people want to be absorbed by, but he also loves Tania and wants Tania to be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania then begins to clean herself off and start to climb up scamps body. She begins to feel his abs and she loves how they feel and begins to rub thoes bricks, scamp begins to twitch his leg and pant as he feels Tania do this. After a while of giving scamp a belly rub she crawls up to his huge mountainous pecs and begins to feel them all over. His pecs are huge and strong and powerfull and comfy, Tania feels like she could just rest here. Just then Tania's hand slips inbetween the two powerfull mounds of muscle, she try's to pull it out but the pecs pull back, she try's to use her other hand to help pull her hand out but that one slips in too. Tania begins to worry as she then feels the two powerfull mounds of chest muscle begin to flex and pull her hands in further pressing her face against the pecs as she gets a face full of scamps dominating musk. Tania crys out to scamp begging  him stop but  then another powerful flex of his pecs pulls her head in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScamp beings to wonder what new power he has now after absorbing that yummy teen and starts to wonder when his next meal will get here. He fanticizes about consuming people by the handful and watching them squirm inside him giving him the pleasure he knows and loves of people struggling to get out when they know they have no hope and their new captor will soon absorb them. He relishes every pleasureful squirm they give him untill the climax of absorbing them. Scamp fantisizes about this closing his eyes and flexing his muscles as his desires start to drive him. Oh how badly scamp wants another human inside him knowing that they are only alive so he can take pleasure in consuming them and watch as he grows and his muscles expand. His fanticys are so powerful be starts to fantisizes about new ways of consuming people like threw his pecs. Heck he could feel the pleasure right now as if it were happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again scamps pecs flex and swollow up Tania's sholders. It wasn't that bad actually Tania actually started to enjoy it as she felt scamps powerful warm muscles message her and pull her in again to bet stomach. She couldn't belive the pleasure she felt as she sank deeper into scamp. Is this what people felt when scamp consumed them? No wonder theirs people that willingly give themselves up to be consumed by scamp. Another gels took Tania up too her legs. Scamp was so warm and inviting that she stoped resisting and waited for the warm embrace of scamp to absorb her. That's all she wanted now, she wanted scamp to consume her. Suddenly she felt something soft yet strong grab her feet and begging to pull her out. She didn't want to leave tho and did what little she was able to to stay inside. With a *schloop* out poped Tania hanging upside down by her feet at airing into scamps happy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi friend. I almost ate you, but like I said I don't eat my friends.\" Scamp smiled as he pulled Tania into a hug pressing her against his pecs. Tania saw the oportunity to enter the welcoming insides of scamps and pushed her head inbetween his powerful pecs. For a second scamp was filled with pleasure as he started to consume Tania again but then realized what she was doing and pulled her out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take me again. I love it it feels to good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I might absorb you and I don't want to lose you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need me so that you can absorb people tho right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I need to cum in order to absorb people. I could do it myself but if feels nice to have you help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just take me In and then let me out latter just so I can relax inside for a bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon but not yet. I need more food before I'm strong enough to select which people I don't want to absorb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTania thought about this and then agreed she could wait. But in the mean time she wanted scamp to flex and tast her so she could feel his muscles and strong welcoming embrace.</span></div></div>",

Helen had shaggy tan hair and mossy green eyes, with white fur running from her forehead down to her groin, with white on her finger and toes and on the tip of her tail.

Going out there would mean playing around with him, his canine friends, and the local cat\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Cody was\u2026 wait. Where was Cody anyway? He wasn\u2019t in the living room with his mom and he wasn\u2019t outside with his brother. There was something coming from the dog room. Maybe he could be there\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Possibly because of the content with it being 13+ but this is 18+ so it doesn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is set in a parallel universe where pets are instead anthros who grow up to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">30</span> 50 feet tall. Houses are adjusted to massive sizes to accommodate for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome small rules:<br>\r\n- The pets should be able to talk at some stage during the story, if not from the beginning.<br>\r\n- No graphic violence.<br>\r\n- Pets should at least initially act like pets. They do not own the humans.<br>\r\n- Sex and other explicit content is permitted.<br>\r\n- Sex with animals in this world is seen as perfectly normal and fine.<br>\r\n- NO killing off main character or in case of yourself, no killing your character either.<br>\r\n- Please have the chapters make sense.<br>\r\n- The pet will start off small (they can be held in your arms) but as they get older will quickly outgrow their owner.<br>\r\n- The pet will age in human years so to keep it all tidy.<br>\r\n- Exotic animals are perfectly fine as well<br>\r\n- Fictional animals (dragons, Pokemon, etc) are also OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE - 27/2/17 - There is no longer a height restriction on pets although they should compare realistically with other animals, for example a tiger should be much bigger than a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add and have fun!</td>",
