(Otherwise my sister had to be a real genius, <br>\r\ngetting all the good marks for her exams and papers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of \"genius\"... Our father Adam is one. <br>\r\nWell, at least in a scientific kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, he is working in a secret, governmental laboratory,<br>\r\nsearching for a super-formula. The usual \"mad scientist thing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that's what I always thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this very day would prove him right.<br>\r\nWell, and totally wrong at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came home from college, I found my Dad sitting in the kitchen,<br>\r\nwhich was kind of strange at this time, because he always used to stay <br>\r\nat work until late in the evenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he wasted no time telling me, that he finally had finished <br>\r\nhis super-formula and that this formula had already proven successful <br>\r\nin animal experimentation, but had been forbidden for further human <br>\r\nexperimentation by his supervisors at the lab...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This super-formula\", Dad turned to me with a lunatic glare,<br>\r\n\"is an absolute revolution to the state of scientific and technical knowledge.<br>\r\nThe beginning of a new and better world! If it wasn't for those blockheads...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as I could remember, my father had always been complaining <br>\r\nabout \"those blockheads\"... I guess, it's the curse of being a genius<br>\r\nto constantly feel misunderstood by others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Dad!\" I nodded in silent agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Junior!\" My father burst out. \"This time they won't block me out!<br>\r\nMy super-formula is ready to heal the world! It's only a matter of our <br>\r\nreadiness and willingness to use it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at my father in disbelief. \"You have stolen your own formula?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a bonehead, Tim!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was my sister's sexy voice, and when I looked up <br>\r\nfrom the kitchen table, my eyes were met by her abundant breasts<br>\r\nfloating just above my and my father's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could Daddy steal, what he originally has created?\" she added<br>\r\nwith disdain at me, then put her sweetest <i>Daddy's Darling Smile</i> on<br>\r\nand brushed a hand through her full, blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your baby girl is ready and willing to be your little guinea pig, father!<br>\r\nAre you ready to turn your little super-daughter into a super-heroine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe my sister's shamelessness! - She almost jammed<br>\r\nher huge knockers into our father's face, while speaking of \"baby girl\"<br>\r\nand \"little guinea pig\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way...\" she turned to me matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n\"Don't you have a date with this little sister brat of Steve's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! I really hated my sister! How had she known about this again?</span></div></div>",

We even bought a little tripartite <br>\r\nlucky charm. - This guy, however, running around in a white spandex-costume <br>\r\nand calling himself \"Mr. Integrity\", was really ridiculous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we went to \"Luigi's\" and had an extra large ice-cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when Steve had to leave for a date at the movies (he didn't wanted to go<br>\r\ninto more details about that), Susan and I spent some time reheating our icy lips<br>\r\n(about which I don't want to go into more details here, either.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally we decided to spent some more time together, and since we didn't want<br>\r\nto interfere with Steve's plans, we decided to go to my place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what a nightmare was waiting for us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe my eyes, when I opened the front-door of my family's house!<br>\r\nThough the lock had been untouched, the interior was a total mess as if a burglar<br>\r\nhad broken in - or a group of aliens had invaded our home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, we found my mother, Evelyn, sitting in the kitchen, strapped to a chair and <br>\r\nbeing gagged. When we relieved her from her bonds, she seemed unharmed,<br>\r\nthough she was completely jazzed and crying her eyes out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experiment...\", \"Stupid girl...\" and \"Madman!\" was all we could understand<br>\r\nbetween her weeps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe, that the Frankenstein-Party had turned out like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, we found my father, standing almost naked... or rather he was kneeling<br>\r\nin front of my sisters locked room door and babbling about \"super-powers\" and<br>\r\n\"new world-eras\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt really miserable in front of my girl-friend, especially since she had never met<br>\r\nmy Dad before... and he obviously was completely out of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHammering at my sister's door, I called her name... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lizzy! Sis! Are you in there??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my relief - I could hear her voice answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Tim... I'm here. But stay out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lizzy! What's going on in there? Open the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think, I would just have broken through the door, furiously like I was getting...<br>\r\nBut then my beautiful girlfriend was shoving a key under my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! Right at your feet...\" she told me with a grin, and I just had to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I unlocked and opened the door - and we found my sister cuffed and <br>\r\ntied up on her bed and with several strange green-glowing infusions and <br>\r\nneedles plugged and pumping into various parts of her naked body.<br>\r\n(And what an incredibly sexy body she had...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bro!\" My sister called at me with a grin, thereby being very focused<br>\r\nnot to move her body. \"Calm down! Everything will be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I was far from calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father! What have you done to her?!\" I turned to my Daddy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liz accepted the super-powers, you didn't want!\" My father responded <br>\r\nwith a scary blitheness in his eyes. \"Your sister is turning into a goddess,<br>\r\ninto a super-heroine now... And there is nothing to stop this anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all birds, this bitch is getting a superhero?\" My girlfriend asked <br>\r\nin a mixture of sarcasm and shock. \"This is just insane!\"</span></div></div>",

Then she walked up at me, and it was only then, that I <br>\r\nrealized, that she had grown taller than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her head had only reached up to my nose, but now <i>my</i> head was<br>\r\njust at the level of her immense breasts. I couldn't help but get a hard-on<br>\r\nas I was eye-to-eye with my sister's big, dark nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hello to the Ladies!\" I heard my sister's taunting voice from high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I could feel her hands at the back of my head as she shoved my face<br>\r\ndeep into her endless cleavage of her huge breasts, which felt invitingly soft,<br>\r\ninvincibly strong and ignitingly hot at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil there was darkness again... and silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finally came to my senses again, I was back at my sister's room.<br>\r\nLooking around, I found my girlfriend Susan, who was just waking from<br>\r\na similar state of bedazzling.

So I asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, what has just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She made it!\" he just answered, while examining the infusion-needles,<br>\r\nwhich, paradoxically, were without any remains of my sister's blood...<br>\r\n\"And my super-formula worked even better on your sister than I ever<br>\r\nwould have expected...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where on earth is she now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my girlfriend and saw pure horror written all over her face.<br>\r\nThen I noticed my mother standing in mute disbelief at the room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to call emergency to help my Mom (and my Dad).<br>\r\nThen I took Susan's hand and got her out of there.</span></div></div>",

And how would they affect her personality?<br>\r\nAnd, by the way, what exactly had happened during this \"Medusa-Show\"<br>\r\nat Steve's room?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody <i>white</i> came for me - and saved me from doing a big mistake!\"<br>\r\nLiz answered my last question, though I hadn't spoken it out aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I looked at her in shock, she just giggled. \"Sorry, Bro... I can read<br>\r\nyour thoughts.\" And with this, she began stretching out of her leathery,<br>\r\nblack catsuit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who was this <i>white</i> person anyway?\" Susan took up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno!\" Liz answered. \"He's definitely been fast and strong.<br>\r\nAnother Superhero... I'd say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another <i>superhero</i>??\" I still couldn't really think of my little sister<br>\r\nas a higher species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it!\" she responded to my thoughts again, <br>\r\nwhile lowering the tight top-half of the leather-suit over her ample bosom,<br>\r\nthereby revealing a very small, black bra, desperately fighting against<br>\r\nher immense breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, how many of these <i>superheroes</i> may be at our city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question!\" Liz turned to Susan. \"Let me have a look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the catsuit, stripped half-way down to her perfect hips, she let go <br>\r\nof it and rose her hands to her beautiful face. With deep concentration, <br>\r\nshe pressed her fingertips to her forehead, closed her eyes and started<br>\r\nto focus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan threw a short, worried look at me, but immediately Liz answered<br>\r\nwith another nasty giggle (to what must have been Susan's thoughts):<br>\r\n\"Don't you really think, I can't hear you, while I'm scanning the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she opened her eyes again. \"I can't tell exactly, but there are a few.<br>\r\nPerhaps 10 to 15, though not all of them are really super...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean <i>really super</i>?\" I asked (trying not to <i>think</i> anymore).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them are just slightly improved... in some special traits...\"<br>\r\nSusan explained, while turning back to the catsuit and stripping it <br>\r\nfurther down over her knockout ass, thereby revealing her panties,<br>\r\nwhich were matching her bra in color and skimpiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... like this <i>white one</i> who carried me away from Steve's room.<br>\r\nHis speed and strength took me by surprise... Otherwise he would<br>\r\nnever stood a chance against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of the <i>white</i> one\", Susan interrupted,<br>\r\n\"What has become of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He brought me here... and went his way. Perhaps I could locate him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think, you could also locate our parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister shook her blond curls in denial, while peeling the catsuit <br>\r\noff her long, perfect legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already tried... But, in this city, there are too many humans around<br>\r\nto single them out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously, right now there is some kind of balance between<br>\r\nall these <i>supernaturals</i>...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan took a look at Liz, who had finally finished her strip and now<br>\r\nwas standing in nothing more than her black, skimpy underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'd say, we keep calm and quiet... And we check how to get back<br>\r\ninto ordinary life - with Liz being just a bit more special than before... <br>\r\nAnd at the same time, we take care of your parents and my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, as far as I read from your thoughts, you've already been chased\",<br>\r\nmy sister chipped in. \"Do you really think, they won't come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about blowing this town and getting away?\" I suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had to laugh at this. \"Of course, I'd go everywhere with you,<br>\r\ngangster, but don't you think there's just too much to leave behind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But shouldn't we at least take cover, until things are sorted out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, I could even feel,<br>\r\nhow she was jabbing her hot, thick teats into me, thereby growing<br>\r\nthem even more and more erect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, little brother!\" I suddenly heard my sister's voice inside<br>\r\nmy head. \"As far as I can remember, your girlfriend didn't wanted<br>\r\nto ever <i>see</i> my <i>fingers</i> on you again.

And though this process seemed to weaken he energies<br>\r\nmore and more, the smile on her face and a captivating look of thankfulness<br>\r\ngrew stronger at the same rate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps there is hope...\" I began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen suddenly the door to our operation room was opened with a loud push<br>\r\nand General Hyena marched in, followed by the girl's father, Adam Woodman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work, Charlie!\" The General grunted, thereby giving a strong pat<br>\r\non my back. \"You and your team did a remarkably job - spotting and scouting.<br>\r\nNow you have earned yourselves a well-deserved break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on our dumbfounded looks, the General added:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellatrix CU-3 is already on her way with the <i>Alpha-Squad</i> to take care<br>\r\nof Stage 2 of this operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Vicky zoomed out of our focused view of the scene, until we<br>\r\ncould see ten, dark helicopters ghostly approaching Liz Woodmann's position.</span></div></div>",

A cold, calculating kernel,<br>\r\nwhich somehow felt like watching me... analyzing me... studying me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to block this presence, but to no avail. Helplessly, I experienced<br>\r\nhow the cyborg's <i>mind</i> was searching through my thoughts, memories<br>\r\nand emotions, thereby reading out everything it assessed relevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered, whether I could follow, which information in particular <br>\r\nthe cyborg was gathering from me. Giving myself in into this fusion<br>\r\nof our minds... bit by bit... and... byte by byte... I started to realize...<br>\r\nand visualize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I saw trees of green... red roses too... <br>\r\nI hear my babies cry... and watch them grow...<br>\r\nand I think to myself...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly my dreadful nightmare is back again.<br>\r\nAll this evil, lustful greed... this sexual malignity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to object. I try to deny. I try to eliminate this dream... these thoughts!<br>\r\nBut the cyborg inexorable unfurls and unfolds every detail, every sector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have a very bad feeling about the cyborg's interest in this nightmare!</span></div></div>",

All my inner voices had yelled<br>\r\nin protest, had demanded respect for my moral standards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was silence. And carefreeness. And satisfaction.<br>\r\nAnd somehow the cyborg's mind had dissolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not really dissolved... as I still could feel its calculating capacity,<br>\r\nthe almost endless range of information stored into its memory cells...<br>\r\nbut the... <i>alieness</i> of the cyborg's mind somehow had faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no conflict between the cyborg's and my own mind any more.<br>\r\nObviously the cyborg had submitted itself to my will. Or it had absorbed <br>\r\nmy mind into its artificial operating system...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, I felt like the one being in control now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to prove my impression right, I realized that I could control<br>\r\nthe cyborg's powerful body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn deep fascination I felt the substantial weightiness of the body,<br>\r\nthough I could move every part of this body with ease now. I raised<br>\r\nmy new, powerful steel claws in front of my eyes and marveled at <br>\r\ntheir incredible power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I realized, that only my left eye offered a \"real\", colorful vision<br>\r\nof the world around, whereas my right, kind of laser-eye offered an<br>\r\nultra-distant view as well as heat vision and an actual laser-firing-mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering how I had been intimidated by the cyborg's massive <br>\r\nbreasts with all their deadly spikes, I lowered my attention at them <br>\r\nand grabbed them with my claws. And the very moment I touched<br>\r\ntheir artificial abundance, I realized their inconceivable powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to a special, extraterrestrial matter, these breasts could be both:<br>\r\nsoft and warm and entrancing like a real woman's bust, but in a blink<br>\r\nof an eye and through the reflex of a simple thought they could change<br>\r\ntheir very substance into those sharp, spikey and deadly globes, which<br>\r\nI had become acquainted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a killer body!\" I had to think, knowing that I had only discovered<br>\r\na fraction of its real potential yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what am I to do with this body? - And where actually am I?\"</span></div></div>",

Then I looked for a safe hiding spot, to wait<br>\r\nfor Tim and his \"suit\" to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes and I saw Tim. Somehow he had gotten a doctor's white coat,<br>\r\nbut he couldn't fool me. (I just knew his posture and his pace all too well.)<br>\r\nHowever, seemingly he had already got rid of the \"suit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Tim got rid of his white coat as well, then he turned southwards and with<br>\r\na few strides he had disappeared into the darkness of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another five minutes I could observe how the \"suit\" left the hospital,<br>\r\nscratching his head, then taking his phone. Quickly I started the camera<br>\r\nof my celly, zoomed in and filmed him dialing (hoping that the definition<br>\r\nwould be high enough to identify the number later on).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five minutes later a dark car picked the \"suit\" up and drove off<br>\r\nnorthwards. - And I was happy, that I had picked the number of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n01:49. Time to move to our meeting point!</span></div></div>",

A Snake Goddessss.<br>\r\nA bloodthirsty predator, who would devour all these loosers of the IPP.<br>\r\nAll those simple-minded \"Investigators of Paranormal Phenomena\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I would become even more powerful!<br>\r\nAnd I would bring even more pain and terror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaaaahhhh!<br>\r\nThissss wasss the beginning of my reign over the world!</span></div></div>",

Dr. Adam Woodman,<br>\r\nI am an investigator of paranatural and supernatural biogenetics,<br>\r\nand... since my time at the universities of Ale, Harvest and Palmo<br>\r\nI have been so privileged as to work for the \"Super Forces Institute\"<br>\r\nat the periphery of our charming town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, as I was asked to add my point of view to this... description<br>\r\nof the recent events, I first of all... want to stress, that I never had<br>\r\nplanned... or wanted for any of this to happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... since the events have turned out to... have occurred... well,<br>\r\nin the way they did... I certainly will support this evaluation... with<br>\r\nall my personal and scientific integrity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPardon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... ehm, yes. You want to hear about my personal experiences<br>\r\nduring the transformation of my daughter, Liz Woodman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, when this process of transformation had started, the involved<br>\r\nhighly-paranatural energies had caused me and my... assistants to<br>\r\ntranscend the deepest borders of our innermost childhood-desires<br>\r\nand livetime-experiences...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is clearly how I got driven away... by my paternal care and<br>\r\nfatherly love... to actually be confronted with a vision of my dear<br>\r\ndaughter... which was... ehm... almost of an... erotic composition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, in a way you could compare this vision with Botticelli's <br>\r\n\"Birth of Venus\"... A most beautiful virgin, emerged from the sea,<br>\r\nmatured into a full grown woman in only the blink of an eye...<br>\r\nready to ascend the kingdoms of heaven... or conquer the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes... That's how I saw my daughter: like an ancient goddess.<br>\r\nAn eternally young woman of divine beauty and immortal powers.<br>\r\nA caring goddess of fertility. An unrivaled empress of matriarchy.<br>\r\nA relentless huntress to her enemies... And the epitome of love<br>\r\nto her believing followers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes... There I was: kneeling at her mighty feet. Kissing her toes.<br>\r\nMarveling at her endless, powerful legs. Not daring to raise my gaze<br>\r\neven higher... But knowing of the abundant, overshadowing glory<br>\r\nof her immense and immortal bosom... the endless flow of her wild,<br>\r\ngolden hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have crushed me with her bare feet. Spike me with the<br>\r\nspear of the huntress. Shatter me with the gaze of her burning eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, suddenly, there only was darkness... and she had vanished.</span></div></div>",
