It clearly sounds female, but for some reason, magnified times one-hundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...\" you slowly sit up from your extremely uncomfortable sleep. It felt like you slept on a rock! Your eyes adjust to the light and you look around, but you don't recognize any of your surroundings. Suddenly, the loud voice from before speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're still alive! Thank the gods, I was so worried! ...Hey, can you hear me? Hellooooooo...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally pinpoint where the extremely amplified voice was coming from and look up above you in shock. It was a giant girl! She stared at you smiling with a huge grin on her face as if she was expecting you to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you're clearly not one for words, I'll start us off: Hi, I'm Lissa! And you are?\" she said as her adorable grin widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait, Lissa? As in Princess Lissa from Fire Emblem: Awakening? How did I get shrunken inside my video game!? That's impossible! What am I going to do!? Oh man, oh man, this is not good...</i>\" you thought to yourself, slowly becoming hysterical. But luckily Lissa isn't that patient and snapped you out of your daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Hey, can you talk? What's your name? C'mon, I won't bite, really!\" Lissa started to plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain finally started to comprehend what she was saying to you this whole time and you try to do the simple task of  remembering your name...but to no avail. Why couldn't you remember you <i>name</i>? That's like the most basic thing ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, um, I-I can't remember my name...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You what?\" Lissa said, putting her hand to her ear and moving her now very large face closer to your body. You could now see of of Lissa's facial features up close, and, you had to say, the game did not do her justice. She was even more pretty up close. Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks were a rosy red, her lips were pursed only slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared in awe for a couple seconds before snapping back to \"reality\" (or wherever you were), and cleared your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I can't seem to remember my name! Do you know how I ended up here shrunken?\" you called up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard you that time and moved her face back before she answered so she wouldn't blow out your eardrums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry, little guy, I just found you here in the barracks just a few minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you say, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no sense dwelling on it too long! We can still have tons of fun!\" Lissa said, giving you a thumbs up and showing that huge adorable grin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! But don't you think we should look for clues to as why I shrunk?\" you called up to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I figure whoever or <i>whatever</i> did this to you is probably long gone by now anyways, so there's no sense in chasing after it. And besides, we're already traveling throughout the continent right now, anyways! So we'll probably meet up with your curser or whatever eventually! Until then, you can stay with me! Don't worry, we'll have tons of fun, and I'll take care of you!\" Lissa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the thought of Lissa \"taking care of you\" and you had to admit, she did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you're probably right\" you say. \"So, what do you wanna do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Lissa pondered...</span></div></div>",

You scrambled to the center of the right cup and tightened your grip on the pink silky fabric with your hands and toes. As you were lifted hundreds of feet (to you) into the air at super speed, Maribelle's large chest loomed ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it! You were barely even larger than her nipple! But just as you were about to be engulfed into the giant mammary's flesh, you heard a voice call out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Belle! Long-time-no-see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Maribelle's eyes focus on the entrance to her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Liss! What are you doing!? I just saw you like five minutes ago! A-And don't come in! I'm not decent!\" You saw Maribelle's face flush a deep color of red that you've only ever seen on tomatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later you glanced back down to where you were to see her giant breast still looming over you, and, upon realization of exactly what was going on, blushed the same color of red that Maribelle wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you look pretty decent to me,\" Lissa said frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalmed at her intended joke and just hoped she'd save you from this embarrassing nightmare soom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny! What do you want?\" Maribelle muttered, still flustered. As she said this, she quickly turned to the side and clutched the bra you were in to her breast, mushing you all over the soft, creamy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, n-no wait! I can help you with that! I know how hard it is to connect the straps in the back, especially with knockers like yours,\" Lissa said, rushing over to you and your captress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, err, well, t-thank you, Liss,\" Maribelle stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle released the hold she had on you and her breast as she handed the bra over to Lissa. You could see out of the corner of your eye that without cover, she now wrapped her arms around her large boobs, still embarrassed that her best friend is helping her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could even react, you saw Lissa's giant hand reach into your silky, pink prison and deposit you onto her shoulder gently. You quickly ran over to grab a long, blonde strand of her hair to hang onto, and walked carefully behind her neck to avoid being seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Lissa was done helping Maribelle put her bra on and you two left the tent with a huge sigh of relief. Lissa plucked you from her shoulder and placed you into her cupped hands to talk. You start first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why'dja do that? I could've been seen! Or smooshed!\" you yell up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehehe...sorry... I didn't think something like <i>that</i> would happen, I was planning on leaving you with her for a bit longer, but then I got a bit worried so I came to rescue you...\" Lissa said sincerely.

Just when you thought this girl's pranks couldn't get any more insane, she came up with this. You considered objecting, but by this point you knew she would not listen to a thing you had to say. All you could do was pray silently that this Olivia person Lissa mentioned was either not hungry, or observant enough to spot you before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I saw Olivia in here just a minute ago...\" Lissa peered into the tent. There were a number of tables laid out, but no one seemed to be present. in fact, the only sign anyone had been here within the last day was a solitary bowl of what looked like stew sitting near the end of a table. Lissa walked over to it and scanned the bowl's contents. \"Beef stew with carrots and asparagus? That's Olivia's favorite, this must be hers!\" Lissa held you in her palm over the warm stew. From your perspective, the waiting bowl was at least 50 feet down. Slowly, Lissa rotated the hand containing you, until you slid out of her grasp and dropped towards Olivia's stew bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall seemed to last an eternity, but eventually, you hit the waiting meal with a soft splash. Lissa knelt down to observe you at eye-level. \"Okay, I'm going wait at another table. I can't wait to see the look on Olivia's face when she sees you!\" <i>If</i> she sees me, you thought to yourself. Lissa stood to full height and left you to wallow in the warm broth as the both of you waited for Olivia to return to her meal. You licked your soaked fingers, the soup smelled and tasted pleasant, but this was no time to get distracted. You push through the broth and vegetables to the edge of the bowl, but unfortunately for you, the ends proved too steep to climb, especially when you're covered in a slick of broth. Defeated, you sulked further into the stew and waited patiently for the prank target to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you heard footsteps coming from the direction of the mess tent flap. You peaked over the brim of the bowl and saw a pink-haired woman entering. Her footfalls grew louder and louder as she neared the bowl, until she sat down directly in front of it, confirmed your suspicions that this was Olivia.. The woman took a fork and resumed eating her meal, completely oblivious to you, much to your disappointment. You tried waving your arms and yelling up at her, but still she did not notice anything amiss. As she ate, Olivia often sighed and took aside glances, as if there was something serious on her mind distracting her. Without noticing, Olivia scooped you up on her next forkful, and drew you close towards her mouth. Her soft, pink lips parted to reveal her enormous rows of pearly white teeth. Panic overtook your mind and adrenaline surged in your veins as you made one final attempt to get the gigantic woman to notice you. Screaming at the top of your lungs, the fork showed no sign of slowing down as you came closer and closer to being devoured by the beautiful giantess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The giantess' warm breath washed over you, still remaining completely blind to your desperate struggle. All appeared lost, but suddenly, just as the fork was about to move into Olivia's mouth, it stopped. You stared wide-eyed as the dark cave in front of you closed and the fork backed slowly away from Olivia's lips. Heart still racing, you took several rapid breaths to try and calm your panic level. Meanwhile, Olivia peered down at her fork, having finally taken notice of something in her lunch that did not belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a...\" Olivia's eyes went wide as she realized just what was caught up in her meal. \"Eek!\" the giant woman's fingers released the fork, and once more you found yourself falling, this time onto the table. The fork struck the wooden surface with a sharp CLANG, you along with it. The fall was not enough to do any serious harm to you, but you could tell you were going to be sore for a little while after an impact like that. You held your aching head in one hand, and used the other to push yourself up off of your back. The pink-haired woman looked down at you with shock in her eyes and a hand covering her mouth. You silently thanked every god you could think of for sparing your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia leaned down to get a better look at the odd bug she thought she had nearly swallowed with her lunch. You looked up to see her massive brown eyes scanning over you. Two braids of pink hair framed her face as Olivia examined you like a bug under a microscope. \"Wait, you're not a bug...\" Olivia observed. Her voice was soft and demure, much unlike Lissa's loud and brash manner of speaking, almost refreshingly so. You tried to wipe the now-cold broth off of yourself as Olivia's hand came forth and gave you a gentle poke with her index finger. Even this beautiful girl's most gentle touch was enough to knock you off balance. Olivia's gasped lightly as you planted our feet firmly back on the ground. \"A tiny person? How did this happen? And how did you get in my stew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Olivia, Lissa was nearing her breaking point. This whole time, she had been watching your plight and getting more and more \"Giggly\" as time went on. By now, Lissa could barely contain herself. Her stifled giggles broke into full on laughter, echoing in the tent. Olivia turned around to face the laughing princess. \"Lissa? What's so funny? Did you do this?\" the dancer's questions only grew in number. Lissa tried desperately to curb her laughter. \"Oh man, you should have seen the look on your face when you saw him! That was hilarious! Ahahaha!\" Lissa allowed laughter to reclaim her, as she leaned on a table to keep herself upright. \"So this <i>was</i> your doing!\" Olivia was suddenly standing tall and resolute. \"This is a joke to you? You almost made me eat this tiny man! Could you imagine what would have happened if I didn't notice him?\" The normally modest dancer was absolutely indignant right now. Lissa could not answer her questions, however, the apparent hilarity of this situation was too much for her, and lost upon Olivia. Scowling at the girl, Olivia gently took you in one hand and walked out of the mess tent, away from Lissa and her insane pranks. Finally, it seemed like your tiny life was in the hands of someone who actually cared for your safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked back over her shoulder as the distance between her and the mess tent grew. You looked up at her pretty face, still pouting and red in the cheeks. She carried you away from the trickster princess and into her own tent. \"Oh thank god, that's over.\" you said more to yourself than Olivia. \"Thank you so much for rescuing me. You have no idea what Lissa has put me through!\" Olivia sat down at a small desk and allowed you to fall from her hand onto it's hard surface. She looked down at you, still wearing the same scowl as before. \"So, Lissa has a tiny trickster accomplice, now? I don't know how you got so small, but that joke was <i>not</i> funny. You nearly scared the life out of me!\" The irony of this statement seemed to fly right over the pretty young dancer's head. \"No, you've got it all wrong! I didn't want to do any of this! Lissa forced me into it, I swear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia only raised an eyebrow quizzically, considering the possible truth of your words.</span></div></div>",

She put me in Maribelle's boot, for god's sake!\" You explain to the giant dancer. \"I didn't want to do any of this, I promise you.\" Olivia was taken aback, finally facing the truth of the situation. \"Oh gods, that must have been horrible. I had the completely wrong idea, I'm so sorry!\" Olivia brought her hand towards you, and held it palm up as if inviting you to climb aboard. \"I don't know how you got like this, or how Lissa got her hands on you, but you're safe with me. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComforted by her words, you stepped forth and climbed into Olivia's waiting palm. The plush platform pulled closer to Olivia's body, and she brought her free hand to gently stroke your head with her index finger. After a long day underfoot, it seems your worries were finally vanishing. You may still be tiny, but with this pretty dancer watching over you like a benevolent goddess, you knew you would be perfectly safe. Silently, you sat and simply let Olivia coddle you to her heart's content. Eventually, you felt her finger retreat, and turned your attention up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly, sorry, but, I must ask something of you.\" Olivia looked away, and her face turned rose red. \"What would that be?\" you asked her, eager to return the compassion she showed you. \"I was going to practice my dancing, but I just can't do it with you watching me.\" Olivia fidgeted. \"I'm going to leave you here, but I need you to promise me you won't watch me. Please?\" the woman stared down at you, her eyes pleading as much as here voice. How could you deny the woman that just saved you from servitude to Lissa something so simple? \"Say no more, I'll have my back turned the whole time.\" Olivia smiled, which proved infectious as you turned your back to the woman so that she could dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia took several deep breaths to compose herself, and soon your could hear her feet fall and her body sway as she danced. You used all your willpower to try and keep your promise to her, but you could not resist sneaking a peek at Olivia's moves. You broke your promise and spun around to spectate Olivia's performance, and found yourself absolutely mesmerized. Olivia's pink hair flew as she moved, and her footfalls were so graceful you could not even hear them. The young woman did not even seem to notice you had broken your promise, whether because you were shrunken, or because she was just so into her dancing. You stared slack jawed until eventually, the dance came to a close. Olivia turned her attention back towards you, and immediately took on her iconic blush when she noticed you had broken your promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" Olivia reeled in horror at the thought of her dancing having been observed. \"Y-You promised not to watch!\" Olivia pouted down at you. \"I'm sorry, Olivia, but you're just so beautiful, I couldn't help myself! The dance was amazing, I might add, you're clearly highly skilled in your art!\" You complimented the betrayed giantess, fearing what she could do to punish you if she so chose. Your flattery seemed to give her pause, however. Maybe she would be willing to forgive?</span></div></div>",

It seemed she would not believe your testimony. \"Lissa may be a prankster, but she's not so reckless as to put you at risk like that.\" If only she knew what you had been through, she would be singing a different tune. \"You shrunk yourself with some magic to satisfy your perverted urges, didn't you?\" The enraged titaness grabbed you between her fingertips and held you up to face level, your body dangling like a puppet on strings. Resist as you might, a glance towards the floor, now several hundred miles down from your perspective, stopped you in your tracks. You watched in awe as the massive face of your new captress came closer. \"You jumped in my lunch to get close to my mouth, hm?\" Olivia brought you lower to face her enormous, predatory lips. She gave them a lick, and you shuddered at the size of her tongue, the muscle dwarfing you by several degrees. \"Well, let me give you what you wanted!\" The goddess' voice completely surrounded you, and your found yourself suddenly thrown through the arch of Olivia's open lips, and into her hungry maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell onto Olivia's soft tongue, and immediately the smell of stew hit you like a truck. You raised your head off the slimy surface to look around, you were penned in by a row of pearly white teeth, some still having shreds of meat and vegetables stuck between them from Olivia's meal. You tried to get solid footing, but the tongue's surface proved too wet and soft to stand up on. Slow and deliberately, Olivia closed her lips, engulfing you in darkness. You could see nothing, and hear only the sounds of Olivia's body, her gentle breath rushing over you like a hurricane, and her distant heartbeat sounding in a steady rhythm. When you tried to move toward her lips, Olivia felt it, and maneuvered you underneath the tongue with surprising dexterity. The sloppy muscle pushed down on top of your head, forcing you face-down into a small pool of the girl's saliva. You coughed and gagged for air, which Olivia must have heard, because your world began shaking violently, you along with it. The massive quake had been caused by only a light giggle from the dancer. As Olivia's tongue oppressed you, you started to feel new vibrations from the organic cavern, this time much, much light, but now more rhythmic. It occurred to you that Olivia must be walking somewhere, but where to, you had no idea. Your torture at the hands of Olivia's tongue continued, as she made her way to wherever it was she was going. Eventually, you felt Olivia's footsteps stop, and the oppressive tongue ease the pressure off of you. Light returning to the moist cavern and Olivia's fingers entering after you confirmed your hopes that she would finally be letting you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia grabbed you with two fingers like she had before and held you out, back into the sunlight. You were still covered in her spit, but at least you were finally free from that claustrophobic space. You felt yourself falling, thankfully still in Olivia's grasp. The ground came closer and closer as the woman lowered, kneeling  to set you gently down in the grass. Each blade was taller than you were, making hard to see anything. You craned your neck upwards as Olivia stood back up to her full, monolithic height. \"You're someone else problem now, bug.\" Olivia said as she raised her foot above you. You instinctively reeled back, closing your eyes and waiting for the end, but thankfully, you were eclipsed in Olivia's shadow as she stepped over you instead, leaving you to quake with the grass at the heavenly step. You watched the pink of Olivia's hair disappear behind a landscape of grass, wanting to follow her and get away from her simultaneously. You were pulled out of your trance by the thought that the open ground was the most dangerous spot for someone of your stature, where anyone walking by could easily crush you underfoot without so much as knowing. You could see the tops of multiple other tents over the grass blades, you dashed for what looked like the nearest one, hoping to find safety within. You crawled under the tent's flap and found yourself looking up at yet another colossal woman. But who's tent did you stumble into this time?</span></div></div>",

You shook your head as you dangled above her boot. You could smell it from above, and it wasn't pleasant. \"No. Don't do it! Please!\" Lissa continued to see it as you overreacting to a harmless game. \"Come on it couldn't be THAT bad.\"  Without the chance of further protest she dropped you in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell inside was just as bad as it was from above. The smelly, hot, and humid atmosphere of the boot sickened you and nearly brought you to your knees. The surface was a bit wet from sweat probably.

Hopefully you won't mind if I wear  the boot. I have to get back to the others.\" You managed to make a response. \"Are you crazy? You'll crush me!\" She just laughs at you. \"I'm a healer, silly. Here this will make you a bit more durable.\" Using her staff, she caused a green light to envelope you. You certainly felt a bit tougher from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok here we go, little guy.\" She says and immediately you see her foot enter the boot. \"No! You can't do this!\" Your screams were in vain and you quickly move back from the huge foot drawing closer to you. You could not back up any further and were trapped. You braced yourself as her foot came over you and pinned you down. Only your head poked out from under her sole next to her big toe. The smell was ten times as bad now. You could hear Lissa speaking above you. \"Wow your kinda comfortable down there. Walking around so much sure makes a girl's foot hurt.\" She pressed her toes against you head. She giggled. \"Wow. I'm having fun already! I'm sure you are as well.\" You certainly were not having fun, and as she began to walk her foot pressed down on you which was painful. As if it weren't enough her sweat was rubbing off on you. You didn't know how much longer you could take this extreme discomfort and disgust.</span></div></div>",

You want to tell her that she\u2019s mistaken, that you weren\u2019t leering at her at all. But the crushing pain is too much. The terrifying goddess brings you closer to herself, and your gasping lungs are filled with her perfume instead on the air that you so desperately need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did some lowborn lout even change his size? Did some grimy mage put you up to this?\u201d You try to object again, but you can only let out a feeble choke. Maribelle\u2019s radiant eyes widen as she gasps in realization. \u201cTHAT\u2019S why. You\u2019re a sniveling little spy trying to get to my dear Chrom through me! Or Lissa! Goodness!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip finally loosens, and you gasp for sweet air. Her hand takes you down to the bed, where she pins you down with only one finger. Still breathing heavily, you notice that you have the clearest look at Maribelle that you\u2019ve had so far. She had not escaped the rain entirely, parasol or not, and her wet outfit clung tightly to her towering figure. If your own size was even comparable to hers, she would have been a delicate-looking beauty. But you quickly regain your senses when the giantess pulls out a spool of thread and a knitting needle. You need to talk some sense into her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a spy, honest!\u201d you plead, as she turns you over and you feel her fingers maneuvering your arms behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think your silver tongue will sway me, you repugnant worm!\u201d She begins knitting the thread around you tiny wrists with incredible precision. \u201cI\u2019m much too clever to fall for the lies of filth like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jerks the thread violently, painfully finishing a strict knot. Then the thread starts weaving around your torso. You might as well keep trying before it is too late. \u201cPlease! I don\u2019t know how I got here, or why I\u2019m so small, but I swear I\u2019m not here to hurt you! I-Hurgh!!\u201d you cry as you\u2019re cut short by another painful jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about hurting anyone. Not anymore.\u201d Maribelle states coldly. She resumes her work, this time binding your ankles. \u201cI had thought that the rain would be my biggest delay to rendezvousing with Chrom\u2019s party, but I simply can\u2019t have you eavesdropping on our strategies when I get there. Tell me everything and delay me no further, you putrid scum! I LOATHE delays.\u201d You feel the thread dig into your ankles as it tightens into place. \u201cWhat did your filthy cohorts send you to learn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up helplessly at this beautiful behemoth before you. There\u2019s nothing you can say to quell her fury, at least nothing that she will believe. You can only wait in horror for whatever fate her gorgeous, devilish smirk has in store for you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She speaks again \u201cThis dreadful weather has me absolutely chilling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hoarse throat still proving useless, you instead decide to test the strength of your binds.

You can hardly believe that this situation is actually turning you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle simply watches you struggle, a thoughtful look on her face. She pours some tea into a cup. \u201cHow cold must one as small as you be?\u201d she asks. She takes a sip of her tea, evidentially waiting for an answer. You try to oblige her, but your dry throat can\u2019t seem to scrape out the words. And why should it? You\u2019re cold, scared, and in pain. You feel like doing anything but talking to your tormenter, so you roll over to look the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to clam up, then?\u201d she continues, \u201cGods, you\u2019re not making this easy for either of us.

She\u2019s dangling you over her fresh, bubbling hot tea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you see here, little man. I\u2019d sooner die than let you or your brigands harm my darling Lissa or Chrom. You\u2019ll have to tell me sooner or later, and I would rather not stoop to torture, so out with it. Who are those scoundrels after!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the heat intensify as you are slowly lowered into your searing fate. But how can you stop this?

Anyway you did assist me in making my wish reality so you will get the same as Robin,time with a part of my body only of my ugh choosing\"</span></div></div>",

The dark mage then proceeded by removing her boots and socks. She slammed them right in front of you. The impact made you bounce a few inches into the air and land on your chest. At the same time, a strong odor rushed over you. You felt dizzy. As you stood up, your jaw dropped in awe. Tharja's perfect feet towered over you. They were more than four times as long as you were tall. That sight mixed with the smell of sweat and leather almost made you faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja wiggled her toes teasingly. \"Get going, my little toy, or you will instead lick the inside of my boots.\" You had no doubts that she would actually do that to you. But your fear gave you strength again and you quickly approached one of her massive feet. When you reached them, you started to wonder how you should massage these monoliths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you tried to just press your hands into the soft and sweaty flesh. And indeed, a soft moan escaped Tharja's lips. But that might just have been Robin's doing. After a while, your hands were soaked in Tharja's sweat. You decided to approached the other foot and handle it the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no easy work, but you had to admit, somewhere inside you wanted to please the dark mage. So you started to climb the foot to reached the higher places. It didn't take long for your whole body to be covered in sweat. At least, you finally got used to the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Tharja told you to stop. \"Well, that was not bad. But my toes are still full of dirt. I want you to clean them next. But to do that, I will...\"</span></div></div>",

It was half your size, so you had a hard time balancing on it. A wicked grin formed on the mage's face. \"Now, shrink for me.\" Immediately, you felt yourself dwindling smaller and smaller. Soon, her big toe was big enough to fit ten people of your size on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your shrinking stopped, Tharja leaned back again and closed her eyes. \"What are you waiting for? Get to work. And you Robin. Ohh, yes, keep doing that.\" Right, the shrunken Robin still was in her panties. But you could only stare in awe at the sight before you. Deep down, her long leg extended for several hundred feet, until it met with her body. Her belly seemed to be as big as the entire camp and her breasts must be like small mountains to you. Suddenly, her face reappeared behind those mountains, like the face of a a goddess, but with an annoyed look in her eyes. \"I said get to work!\" Her angry voice made you flinch and you felt yourself shrinking a little more. \"Yes, mistress.\" You quickly replied, not sure if she could even hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes were beautiful, even her toenails were perfect. But at your size, you could see some lints here and there. Reaching under her toenail, you grabbed some of them. You groaned. These things were like rocks. You took one of them and threw it off her toe. But there was so much more, plus, there were nine more toes to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had finally cleared the nail, you wandered to the edge of her big toe. There was a gab between this and the next one. You gulped. The fall down to the space between her toes was deep, the fall to the ground even deeper. Gathering your strength, you jumped and barely made it. You then proceeded to clean her next nail. But massaging her feet had already exhausted you and this task was even more difficult. Also, the smell of her feet started to overwhelm you. You thought you had gotten used to it, but now, as you were even smaller, the smell was even more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third or fourth toe, you weren't sure anymore, your dizziness took over, When you tried to jump to the next toe, you slipped and fell. Thinking this was the end, you closed your eyes. But then you hit the ground way earlier than you had anticipated. You weren't even hurt. When you opened your eyes, you found yourself on a giant finger. A scream escaped your mouth as it moved you at an incredible speed towards Tharja's face. Her giant eye now filled you field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one. I think you did enough cleaning for now.\" Her voice was unusually soft. You were surprised that she also had such a caring side to her. \"Here, how about a little reward. Or should I say BIG reward.\" With that, she removed her bra. You breathed in deeply when you saw her massive breasts, resting before you. \"But you should not be the only one to enjoy this. After all, my playthings' purpose is to please me.\"</span></div></div>",

The mage held a book in her right hand, her eyes flying over the pages, until she found what she was looking for. Her lips curled into a satisfied, mischievous smile. Her piercing gaze then fell upon you as she reached out with her left hand, which was now surrounded by a purple glowing mist. She extended her long index finger, pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see the extent of my power. Be prepared to be a bug even to bugs.\" Tharja's voice was shaking with anticipation, the power obviously getting to her head. You wondered how much smaller you could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt like you were falling. You shrank smaller and smaller, the mage's big toe expanding in all directions around you. At first, you had a hard time balancing on it, then it became the size of a big rock, then a market square, then the army's camp. You were afraid that your shrinking would never stop. Panicked, you looked at Tharja, but she just laughed maniacally, her eyes glowing with lust for power. Eventually, you just lay down and closed your eyes, the mage's thundering laughter surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you felt it stop. Carefully, you got up and opened your eyes, only to drop to your knees. Vast did not even begin to describe what you saw. Tharja's big toe was so gigantic, the entire capital city could be placed on it and there would be enough space left for fields and a large forest. Far in the distance, you could see the mage's other toes, looking like a giant mountain range. Not far from you, you spotted a giant boulder. To your horror, you realized that it was merely a grain of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAGNIFICIENT! IF I COULD GROW SO BIG THAT NORMAL SIZED HUMANS WOULD BE AS SMALL TO ME AS YOU ARE NOW, I WOULD BE ABLE TO CRUSH EVEN GRIMA WITH JUST MY LITTLE TOE! I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I ACHIEVE THAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja's thunderous voice was booming from the heavens. You could see the beautiful body of the mage filling the horizon. Her gorgeous face was so far away, but her eyes seemed to rest exactly where you were. Did she cast a spell to be able to see you at your minuscule size? Again, you were afraid of how insignificant you were compared to the dark mage. But it was not all bad. Tharja was like a goddess, she was your entire world, and you began to like that thought. You lay down and kissed the divine ground that was the tip of her mountainous big toe. You felt like dedicating your whole life to your new goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, WORSHIP ME, LITTLE PLAYTHING!\" Tharja's powerful and seductive voice echoed across the land. So, she was able to see you. \"BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A GOOD LITTLE WORSHIPPER, I WILL GRANT YOU THE HONOR OF MARVELING AT MY DIVINE FORM FROM ANOTHER POSITION!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the titanic finger descended downwards. You gazed up in awe at that moving mountain. Next, purple mist surrounded you and you were lifted into the air, only to be send flying at incredible speed. When you stopped and landed on a soft surface, you immediately looked at your surroundings to find out where you were.</span></div></div>",

You now are both standing on the stomach of the ivory haired giantess before who was stirring awake from the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Tharja was enjoying herself intensely. \" I've dreamed of being this close, and she's the size of a goddess!

You weren't alone however, and to each side of yours was a slim and feminine hand excellently manicured and moisturized, each one leading up to an arm poking out from a red blouse. That blouse belonged to a young woman easily identifiable by her fire-red ponytail. She was smiling a greatly satisfied smile at you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well then, looks like my prototype shrink potion was a success,\" Anna said. \"Though you've shrunk a little more than what I had planned for, the fact that you've shrunk means that just a few tweaks here and there and this baby will be on the market in no time.\" That thought scared you; a potion that can shrink people to just barely over what had to be two inches would lead to a disaster for the general public if sold. Who knows what sort of dastardly schemes one could hatch? \"If I could just grow you back to a bigger size then I could better test out this mix, but until then I guess I'll just have to settle for this.

With that said, where should I put you\u2026?\" Where she had to feel you huh? The way you saw it there were two choices, the obvious choice of going into her pockets (which you feel were probably lined with gold knowing her) or you could go for somewhere more bold like her underwear (though her tone implied it there was no guarantee that she was planning sexual things with you).

Out of everywhere you could have picked, you chose my pockets?\" You didn't want Anna to get funny ideas about you, and since she was a money fetishist of the highest order you knew that you ultimately couldn't make off with any of her gold even if you wanted to. \"You must really want to feel up my valuables huh? Well, since you've done me a huge favor being my little test subject for this shrink tonic I suppose that's a fair trade in return; alright then, in you go!\" Without missing a beat, Anna quickly dropped you into her pocket and you landed butt-first on one of her gold coins. The next thing you knew Anna was patting you from outside her pocket. \"There you go\u2014a first class seat with a lovely lady. Get yourself comfortable 'cause you are in for a ride.\" With that you could feel Anna making her way somewhere unspecified, and then you realized just how horrific it could be being in a woman's pocket full of heavy gold coins, especially when she had to sit down\u2014in those instances, the space constricted and the coins fell over, nearly crushing you. On top of this, though Anna smelled pleasant enough with her lotions and perfumes wafting through to her pants, it was difficult for you to breath with her pocket hole not being open enough. After having endured an entire day of this, you felt Anna's hand gingerly pluck you out of her pocket and sit you atop her office's desk. Though you were rattled by the prior experiences, you were still standing on your feet, meeting Anna's mischievous smile she propped her head on her hands\u2014eyeing you with quiet intrigue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, how was Anna's Gold Express?\" All you could really give her was a shaky smile and thumbs-up, and Anna's smile grew just a little more playful. \"Aw\u2014someone's a little jittery from the ride\u2026 We can't have that little issue can we? How's about I cut you a deal: you keep helping me with my new shrink tonic and I'll make it worth your while~.\" From your point of view, you had little choice but to assist the merchant woman, but she was certainly asking a lot of you; being shrunken down to where you had no choice but to help her or face some unpleasant consequences with no actual promise of being compensated was a bitter pill to swallow. Perhaps you should have her sweeten the deal, or you could let her decide what your reward will be for helping her\u2026</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Anna suddenly yawned and stretched her arms, cuing you in that it was time for some shut-eye, though you couldn't help but catch a glimpse of Anna's heaving chest as she did so. \"Welp, I'm bushed\u2026 Today was a very productive day for me, but tomorrow's gonna be a real grind so I better hit the hay.\" You were just about to protest simply being left on Anna's desk just in case someone else were to come upon him shrunken down, raising all sorts of questions you were sure you couldn't or didn't want to answer. Anna saw your discomfort and leaned in extremely close with the same coy smile on her face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, don't worry, I haven't forgotten about my new little investment. Luckily for you I've got just the spot you can sleep in for the night\u2014several in fact~.\" Anna picked you up once again and made her way over to her bed, sitting you on her nightstand and opening up an empty drawer. \"I can get a small blanket or two to lay on in here, and I'll lock it up for the night so no one will open it for any reason. Or\u2026you can choose between few other hotspots of interest\u2026\" Anna then tugged on the neck of her blouse and the hem of her pants while flashing you a mischievous grin. \"At least this way, I can keep you on my person more closely. Don't worry, you won't get crushed or anything like that\u2014just a teeny bit smushed is all~. So, what'll it be?\" If you thought nothing could get redder than Anna's hair, yo were proven wrong with how intense your cheeks caught fire at Anna's suggestions. Thinking to yourself, you knew you had to make a choice that wouldn't be too much of an issue for you; if you slept in Anna's drawer, you could sleep undisturbed by anyone else but Anna could accidentally leave you in there by mistake, though if you chose to sleep in Anna's undergarments you were less likely to be forgotten come sunrise but at the cost of somehow getting crushed by her. Also, who was to say that Anna was serious about the latter? Making up your mind you decided that\u2026</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

As you told Anna this, you could've sworn you saw the faintest hint of disappointment in her eyes with the subtle drop of her smile, but it was too brief before Anna smiled at you more brightly. \"Alrighty then: nitghstand drawer it is!\" Anna took a small blanket and folded it up to fit it inside her drawer right before plucking you off her nightstand and gently dropping you inside. \"Okay then, sleep tight! I'mma just lock this up so you won't have to deal with unwanted visitors.\" After the drawer was closed on you, you could hear the sound of a key clicking into the lock, sealing you inside. Anna yawned once more and you heard the shuffling of cloth before she presumably laid down in her bed. \"Get some rest my little investment 'cause we got ourselves a busy day tomorrow.\" After disrobing yourself down to your underwear you said goodnight to Anna even though she likely couldn't hear you, and eventually you had drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sometime in the middle of the night, however, you found your peaceful sleep disturbed by what sounded like labored breathing coming from outside of the dresser you were sleeping in. Immediately you knew it had to be Anna, and from the sound of her breathing it seemed like she was all hot and bothered. You at first wondered if it was due to some fever she had caught, but that didn't seem likely given how healthy she sounded earlier. Eventually, her breathing gave way to moans and groans that you immediately knew that Anna was anything but sick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmmph\u2026yes\u2026\" Anna purred. You didn't need to be able to see her to know what she was up to, and not wanting to be party to such a lewd show you tried forcing yourself to sleep. Sadly, Anna's voice only seemed to reach a higher pitch despite how much you tried blocking out the sounds. \"Oh, if only you were just a little bit bigger\u2026\" Even though you knew you shouldn't, you felt your curiosity pique at the woman's admission. Was she alone or did she invite company over for some fun? You put your ear against the wooden wall to listen in on the sounds being made. You heard giggling from Anna, but no man could be heard in bed with her. \"Ah, but I can fix that soon my little boy toy~\u2026\" Was she actually talking to someone or was she actually in the middle of some wet dream\u2026? Without any sort of hole in your drawer you couldn't check on her to see what was going on (not that you were supposed to given the circumstances), but the next big clue had come in no time at all. \"Haaa\u2026 How's it feel, [NAME]\u2026 You like it when I dip you into my honeypot\u2026? How do I taste?\" You had backed up away from the wall in disbelief; Anna was addressing <i>you</i> as she masturbated in bed! Something told you that she certainly had illicit intentions towards you, and with you in your small state it was only a matter of time until that became a reality. Then you remembered some of the words Anna had said to you when you had first shrunk:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>'A tiny man is sure to be of a lot of use to a lady, and I've got many uses for you\u2026'</i> You didn't realize the double meaning behind the statement then, but with you essentially cornered by Anna it was all you could think of.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't be shy; my body's a beautiful temple of treasure just waiting to be explored, so what are you waiting for?\" From there Anna's sounds of sex increased in intensity and lewd factor, and you found yourself getting off to the thoughts and sounds of Anna pleasuring herself while fantasizing about you. Soon you were both masturbating to each other, and Anna soon reached her climax with a melodious moan. You had yet to reach orgasm yourself, and doubted that you would with what Anna had said next.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So\u2026 How'd you like that little teaser, [NAME]?\" Unsure of what that meant, you stopped yourself to wait for Anna to finish speaking. \"I know you're still awake in there; after all, how can <i>any</i> man get any kind of sleep with such a smoking hot babe touching herself\u2014whispering his name\u2014right next to him?\" Left speechless by Anna putting you on the spot like that, you were unsure of what to say next, if anything at all.</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

You were compelled to ask Anna what exactly would she get out of it besides the sex itself; she was a merchant after all, and if she wanted someone to do her favors then she was more than capable of it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All you gotta do is just ask me~.

We'll be marching into uncharted territory, and who knows? Maybe we'll even give rise to a new market out there\u2026Whaddya say little man?\" Anna didn't need to ask you twice for your assistance\u2014mostly because it would be hard to get about without her helping you in return and partially because you were intrigued by her interest in you, so of course you said yes. Anna was then grinning ear to ear with what was likely the second most satisfied look on her face, moving a finger to pat your head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I knew I could count on you,\" Anna whispered. \"So understanding and reliable~\u2026I almost wish more men would be like you, but then you wouldn't be so special am I right?\" Anna sure knew how to compliment a guy, leaving you a blushing schoolboy before her. \"Now, I know we both need to get some sleep and all, but something tells me you're not all that tired anymore eh? Maybe hearing my voice got you all excited~?\" You couldn't deny that you were now very much horny and would love nothing more than to get off in the night, but you were still quite exhausted from earlier in the day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't have to say 'yes' if you're too tired,\" Anna said, almost as if she had read your mind. \"I don't know about you, but I think I'm still good for another hour or two; maybe I'll even let you get a sense of familiarizing yourself with my body for the future\u2026 After all, a little guy like you can be of good use for a lady, and boy do I have things for you to do\u2026\" You debated on the subject of whether or not you should just get some sleep and worry about this subject another time; though the thought of having some intimacy with one of the most strikingly sexy ladies was a fair prospect.

It didn't look like Anna had any other places she could put you, but then the perverted side of you began looking toward her other valuable \"assets\". A part of you wondered if Anna actually wore anything underneath those clothes of hers, and without thinking you blurted out the question. Anna's raised eyebrow\u2014verging on unamused by your question\u2014was more than enough to make you a flustered mess spamming apologies to the point of begging for mercy. The next thing you heard was a sinister chuckle as Anna's eyes were narrowed dangerously. It was at this moment you knew: you fucked up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, you think you want to stay in my ladywear for the day huh?\" Anna asked you. \"Well, how about I cut you a deal hm? I'll let you take a joyride in my underwear\u2014whichever one you pick\u2014and in return you'll have to help me with my new shrink tonic. A fair trade no?\" Anna's tone very much meant that you would become her eternal bitch of you went through with it, but then again she's the one that shrunk you without your knowledge or consent in the first place, so if Anna was offended by you asking to take a ride in her undies then that was to be expected. So you made your intention clear and reminded her of the predicament you were in, telling her that you'll help her with her tonic on the promise that she also changed you back soon enough; you never asked to be a test subject of hers and who knew what else she had in store for you, so you established some ground rules between you two and waited for her response. She paused for a moment, deep in thought, and finally opened her mouth to answer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I suppose you do have a point or two,\" she said. \"Yes, I waited until the right time to use my new tonic on you to see if it would work, and it did! But you know, even if I don't have your cooperation, I could just find another more willing test subject and leave you like this, and there'd be nothing you could really do about it.\" The cold reality of Anna's words hit you like a Bolganone spell; you ultimately had no real power over her making any sort of demands, and if she wanted you she would just leave you to your fate or worse. Ultimately the best option was for you to simply do as she said in the hopes that she'd at least be decent enough when handling you. Your mind made up, you told her you would work for her if only to eventually get back to normal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really? You'd do anything and everything I ask of you?\" Anna asked. \"Remember, I'm the one that has the final say-so on what we do together given how small you are, and that means I have complete leverage over you. You realize this right?\" You nodded your head, the increasing feeling of powerlessness getting to you and conceding with the merchant woman. \"Alright then, it looks like we have ourselves a deal then. You scratch my back, I scratch yours; simple.\" Before you could ask Anna again where she would end up putting you since it seemed like her underwear was now out of the question, she suddenly started to disrobe before you, showing off her lacy red and expensive underwear. \"Since you're going so far as to effectively be my slave, I suppose I can grant you a request or two every now and again. You've got some guts to ask that of a lady I'll give you that, and you are right about me pretty much forcing you into this, so it wouldn't do if I was an all take and no give sort of partner. Now, I've got two choices for you: you can pick between my bra or my panties, and once you make a decision you can't go back on it for the rest of the day you hear?\" Understanding full well where you stood, you nodded your head. \"Good. So, which one are you going to choose hm?\" Once again your dick was telling you to go straight for her panties, wanting to get all the closer to her precious woman hood, but you didn't want to push it too much given how you couldn't change your mind later. So with that in mind, you decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

That clearly make you realize that giantess girl is no one else than Nah the manakete-human hybrid and daughter of Nowi. You must were been in her purse and the giant stone was her dragonstone.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake with a massive headache. Your entire body is stiff and you can feel the hard, uneven ground beneath you. You try to open your eyes only to instantly be blinded by a bright light and instinctively cover your face with your hands. You can hardly remember what happened, other than a few bits and pieces that pop up in your head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou were on your way home. It was dark and in some alleyway this guy walked towards you. Then someone or something hit you hard from behind. Everything was blurry when the last things you heard were that guy saying: \u201cThat finishes business here. You! Go dump this him somewhere!\u201d Though his voice. It sounded weird. Kind of disturbed, but that must have been from the blow to the head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWait, to the head?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs your eyes now slowly adjusted to the light you reached to the back of your head and, as expected, it felt wet. But there is something soft underneath it like a knapsack. When you pull your hand back in front of your face, you could see you are wearing black and purple gloves. Given they are now also a bit soaked with your blood, but they seem oddly familiar to you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter your eyes now fully adjusted to the light, you slowly rise of the ground almost falling over on your face now. Then something falls over your head. It's the hood of a cloak you are wearing now, with the same colours of your gloves and some familiar pattern. After taking a second look, it appears to be made from a single piece of a scaled creatures skin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhere did I get this thing?\u201d you think, before you notice something far more important. \u201cWhat in the world could be big enough to make this from?!\u201d you almost shout. You try to think of an animal, but you don\u2019t know anything that has such colouring and patterns.\u201cAh, whatever. Now, where the hell am I?\u201d you think, throwing away the other questions for now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOnce you take a look around, you notice something bad. You are in the middle of nowhere in waist high bushes. Funny their pretty flat. It's almost like huge grass. \"Great. Just great. What comes next? Am I gonna get assaulted by the wildlife?\" you say jokingly, though a part of you knows if that would happen, it's not going to end well. You grab the bag and throw it over your shoulder. You know there will be enough time to see what's inside. After all your not expecting to see anything intelligent for sometime and your bleeding seems to have stopped to. At least for now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut before you can get moving, you see something coming your way. You try to see what it is, fearing the worst, but you are reliefed when you make out what it is. It's a woman slowly moving in your direction. She is a true beauty. The curves of her face are soft and her skin is seemingly perfect. She has full and firm, smooth lips. You can see that she didn't even use make-up. Her beauty is completely natural, just like her deep green eyes. You could get lost in them for hours. Her long hair is a bright lime-green in colour. It is being held in a little bit messy, but still nice looking ponytail by a red band of sorts. There is a headpiece of somekind she wears that doesn't look all that great in combination with the rest of her, but who are you to judge others fashion sense, considering what you are wearing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of clothes, most of her clothing was in different shades of red with the little cape she wears in pink. Her boots were red like roses in the summer with heels  and go up all the way to her knees. The moment you realize that one of her feet comes down next to you and after another second you finally get the situation. You are tiny! Maybe 4 inch tall, if you're lucky! You mind is racing and you can hardly think straight, but one thing is certain to you right now and that is that you need help. The only help anywhere near you though is the giantess that's about to walk pass you, which leaves you with barely enough time to jump on her boot and grab  hold of it, before you get an actually stable and slow ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning against the leg behind you, you look up to only for your view to be blocked by the rather big chest of your ride. You quickly look back in the direction your headed, before you see something you may shouldn't. The area around you is just like it seemed from the ground itself. Plains of grass with no town or anything nearby, though you could see a bit more rough terrain, probably a mountain range, on your way. The steady movement of and silence of the land around you - or is it the blood loss from before? - is making you sleepy and you could feel yourself slowly drifting back to sleep - or a coma if you're really lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how much time has passed since you fell asleep, but when you wake up, you find yourself in front of what seems to be the ruins of some temple or somthing similar. After that you notice the ground below you feels different. It doesn't feel like the soft fabric of the boots, but more like cold, hard rock which you confirm with a look beneath you. Then you hear something move behind you. Once again out of instinct, you jump up and spin around only to lose your balance and fall back over completely dizzy. You could hear a giggle and once your vision became clear again, the giantess with you hitched a ride, is filling your whole sight. She looks down on you with a gentle smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasicly frozen with fear of what this gorgeous beauty could do to you, you are happy that you are so scared you can't even piss yourself, which would be more embarresing than anything else. After a few seconds of silence and awkward starring at each other you manage to get a weak, quiet \"Hello\" out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Starring at the lady towering above you was both, fearsome and fascinating. On one side there are all the possibilitys of how easely you could get killed by her. Crushed, eaten, tortured, unintentionally stepped on - which almost happened! - or a fate even worse. Becoming nothing but a mere slave, though for you that last option might not be so bad, given what a beauty your mistress would be, but still you would be everything other than happy.<br>\r\nOn the other side of your mind, just looking at her face seemed to calm you down bit by bit. It's as if her presence alone, is enough to make your worrys flow away like a silent river and her gentle, soft smile makes you feel welcome lika a warm breeze, when you step inside your house and out of a snow storm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt feels like your starring at her for hours, but somehow you know it are merely seconds, before the lady replies to your greet, which your surprised she even heard, since you barely even made a noise there.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hello, little one.\" Her voice sounds like an angel inviting you into the heavens. It's smooth sund eases your fear further, alllowing you to move again and even though you don't piss yourself, you still shake uncontrollably. \"My name is Tiki. Please to meet you little one.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer name. You know it from somewhere, but where? What is it with all these deja vus you're having?! How in the f**k did you even end up like this anyway! You're screaming this in your mind, while you somhow stammer your response. \"I-I-I a-a-am...\" You barely manage to get your name out. Your fear of Tiki is more than obvious at this point.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Please, don't be afraid of me, little one. I mean you no harm.\" You could hear a hint of sadness in her voice, which means she is atleast somewhat honest, so you try to stop shaking, which you somehow manage to do. Though despite the fact that you try to trust Tiki, her next action catches you off guard. She reachs out for you. She isn't doing it very fast, but to you at your current size it was pretty damn fast. Your fear gets control of you again and you curl up in a ball and cower in fear in front of her. You can feel yourself being picked up very gently and Tiki lifts you over to her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBefore you have even the slightest idea of what she's doing, you're firmly being pressed against her chest. Her skin is soft and smooth like no other you had felt before and the the constant heartbeat you hear in an unchanging rythem. The entire time she pets your back with one of her fingers - which are slightly shorter than you are tall, making you estimate yourself to be all most 4 inches (around 10 cm) tall - and is humming a friendly and calming melody.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou two remain like this for a few minutes, all the while you feel safe within her hands. Your head is clear of almost anything until you start to look down slightly. Everything below you is blocked by Tiki's breasts and they are more than above average in size. Almost the instant you get a small view, you start to blush and close your eyes, slowly uncurling in Tiki's hand. Though it's taking a lot of discipline in order to get the thought, of her breasts, that stick out about a foot more than you are tall from her chest, out of your head. You just hope Tiki didn't see you looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes Tiki pulls you back, you now sitting in the middle of her hands. Once again that awkward silence comes over you two, as neither of you know what to say. Despite the fact that you don't mind it, since the silk gloves Tiki's wearing are comfortable and you get a first row view of her, you feel a bit uneasy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm s-sorry for being afraid o-of you, lady Tiki\", Damnit! You still can't control your fear! \"But I-I just woke up  a few hours ago, after I got shrunk apperently.\" That must have been the most ridiculous thing you ever said, but what else could you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need for you to appologize, little one. Normal things and people must be very intimidating to you.\" At least she understands your current situation. \"But, plase. There is no need to be so formal. We're equals after all.\" ... Did She just call you EQUALS?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think, I quiet understand la- Tiki. I mean, what can I even do on my own like this. I could probably get killed by a small rat or the like. In fact I don't even know, where I am.\" You are fully aware of the situation you're in and there is no point in denying it. Also, where in the actual f*** are you? Before you passed out you where in an allyway in a huge city with skyscrapers pretty much everywhere! Hey, you're starting to get your fear, somewhat, under control now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your situation does not change who or what you are, am I right? Everyone is born the same, so why would one be above another? To me, we are equals so please, do not think of yourself so lowly.\" The entire time she talks, her gentle smile never leaves hr face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tiki, but I still don't know what I should do or how I can return to normal. Not to mention, that there is nothing that CAN'T kill me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now you can stay with me, little one.\" That sentence alone makes your heart rise. \"I came here to rest and restore my powers in order to aid a group of warriors that try to free this land from Walhart the Conqueror.\" Another one of those names, that you're familiar with! At this point you feel like hitting your head on the stones Tiki is sitting on. \"They have some very experienced mages with them, so they might be able to change you back if it is some sort of curse or spell. Until then you will be safe with me. Though for now you can move around as you please. These ruins are protected by ancient magic.\" Did she just mention MAGIC twice? Ahh, whatever. At this point you're willing to believe anything to stay sane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, Tiki. I gladly accept your offer.\" Though it wasn't much of an offer, but it just feels like the right thing to say in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel and a second later see, that Tiki was lowering her hands, and you with them, down to her lap. You look up only to see her beautiful green eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then for now I shall rest. Once I awaken again, we shall go and seek the help of...\" And off to the land of dreams, she is. You have to admit, that her falling asleep like that is kind of cute. But you are in for one hell of a surprise, when she suddenly starts to glow in a weak light. After you get over the initial shock, though there is little worry as the glow doesn't seem to affect anything and after what you've seen so far, you couldn't care any less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there is only one thing for you to decide left. Do you stay here in the lap of the sleeping Tiki and maybe take a nap yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you go and explore these ruins a bit on you own. The dragon statues make it seem particularly interesting and a part of you feels strangly drawn to it.</span></div></div>",

Sparks flew from clashing swords, shields banged together with a loud clang, and armored horse-drawn men galloped at each other with rage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you remembered...you're only a couple inches tall! You had to get out of there, as cool as it was to watch, you couldn't risk getting trampled by someone without them ever even knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your slow backing away in awe turned into running as fast as you could in terror, a giant crimson red-heeled boot stomped in front of you, blocking your path!

You look at her long, flowing blue hair and her deep blue eyes...They seem somewhat...sad? It's kind of hard to tell from your height. You then notice she is wearing what you would think wouldn't be the best battle armor, but hey, what do you know? You quickly decide to hitch a ride and climb onto the front of her left boot. After what seemed like hours, the fighting stopped. You feel sick to your stomach from hanging onto this girl's boot the whole time. You loosen your tight grip on the boot but your arms remain around it just for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sigh</i> Well, another battle won, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look up to try to home in on where the voice was coming from, but instead just get a lovely upskirt of the girl's underwear *nosebleed*. You're supposed to be trying to get help from her! You quickly look back down out of embarrassment and respect, and just assume the voice is coming from your hopeful savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish we didn't have to fight so much. Why should any more bloodshed have to occur?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Was she talking to herself?</i>\" you thought. You glance around and didn't see any people she could have been conversing with. \"<i>Wow, this must really be weighing heavily on her conscience...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least the local villagers were all right..\" the girl finished off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

You didn't have much mass in your current state, at least not nearly enough to resist being tossed around in the princess's panties. Well, 'tossed' probably wasn't the most accurate word to use. You weren't shifting from one location in the panties to another, the princess's fantastically huge ass was quite simply ruthlessly pummeling you into the silky soft fabric of her panties, which in turn would cocoon around you and catapult you back into the plush, squishy flesh of the lone cheek that was mercilessly bullying you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, what a rear it was, even if you were normal sized you still would've said the princess was blessed with a larger-than-normal backside. Too bad you were experiencing first hand the old adage \"too much of a good thing.\" The soft cheek wasn't agonizing by any means, but being buffeted endlessly by the immeasurable weight of the princess's massive bottom wasn't pleasant, and the dehydration brought on by the heat was mixing with the dizziness caused by your repeated collisions with the enormous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, after a few minutes the princess seemed to have stopped moving. Thanking any god listening for the sudden richly-needed reprieve, you squirmed desperately to get your face out of the princess's giant butt cheek, straining to get into a position that would help you hear just why the princess had stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is the place? Looks like any regular old mercenary camp to me.\" Came a harsh, deep voice that clearly belonged to a woman with more muscle on her than was common.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Know this is the place! My contact wouldn't lie to me. I think I can see Renais colors on the tents over there...\" A quieter voice hissed, no doubt belonging to a smaller woman than the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, you two. We've got a job to do, and I won't have your bickering get us caught before we've located our target. Pablo's mercs in the valley got wiped out less than an hour ago. The princess of Renais can't be far from her camp.\" The last voice was the most worrying to Eirika. The tone suggested a woman in between the builds of the first two, but the authority behind suggested a woman of both power and authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a few dozen steps away was the target of their contract. Eirika was crouched behind a wide tree, one hand over her mouth to suppress the noise of her breaths. How had these women found her camp so easily? They clearly weren't Grado soldiers, or allies of the mercenaries from earlier. They had to be operating under a separate contract. She could only imagine what they were after. The best case scenario was that they were aiming to capture her alive and hold her for ransom, and even that would've left her army leaderless and in disarray. And she would've hated to give her brother cause to rescue her again. He'd already had to bail her out of one blunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't like her odds. She was lightly armored, carrying only her rapier at the moment. And that last woman worried her... A promoted unit, no doubt. Once rare, combatants blessed by crests and seals were becoming increasingly common, and Eirika didn't have nearly enough similarly blessed soldiers under her command. Most vexing of all was the fact that she had failed to qualify for the blessings of both the Knight and Hero crests, leaving her woefully outmatched against not one, not two, but three opponents. Sneaking a peak, the young warrior princess took stock of the enemies who unknowingly stood between her and her camp. A heavily muscled, long-haired<br>\r\nwoman dressed quite scandalously, wearing only ragged shorts and a thick fabric wrapping around her prominent bust leaning on an over-sized ax; a short blonde woman dressed in green wielding a bow with a set of knives at her waist, and lastly... a tall, haughty looking woman with ruby-colored shoulder length hair and unmistakably dressed like a sage. Although the short sword at her hip didn't look like it was for show...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirika did her best to silence her pounding heart while she tried to come up with a plan. She couldn't fight the mercenaries, not while she was outnumbered and facing enemies both up close and at a distance. She couldn't surrender- she had no idea if these women were aiming to take her alive or not... that left only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to run. As much as it pained her to run when her camp was so close, it was the only option. Although if these women were on their own, that meant that if she found a decent hiding spot the mercenaries would be forced to leave in order to avoid being spotted by her soon-to-return army. Her mind made up...</span></div></div>",

Your shrunken form may have been quite small in size (when compared to your normal height), but you were still large enough that you took up quite a lot of space in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming and flailing as the sudden torrent of water swept you up, you found yourself violently tumbling about in the princess's mouth. Just like being struck by a forceful wave while visiting the beach, you were completely knocked off your feet and submerged by the sudden aquatic surge. There was water up your nose and in your lungs, and when you did manage to get your head above water your head was pounding and your nostrils were burning. Worse still, you had all of a single terrifying second to glimpse the pitch-black hole at the end of the mouth before the water forcefully carried you into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming louder than ever, you dropped like a stone for mere moments before practically being crushed between the muscles of Eirika's esophagus. The experience surprisingly wasn't too painful, given that the large amount of water the princess was swallowing helped sweep you down like a comically-oversized pill. It was, however unpleasant and terrifying in the extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ordeal of being swallowed at your size (an overly large mouthful for the princess) had not made for an easy trip down; outside your fleshy prison the princess was gagging and pounding at her chest. Unfortunatly for you, Eirika hadn't bitten off more than she could chew (or swallow, in your case), and she had managed to swallow you, albeit with great difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings of claustrophobia the likes of which you had never before experienced in your life shook you to your very core. You were slowly being dragged down a narrow, fleshy tube by what felt like thousands of pounds of force being exerted all around you, somehow not crushing your tiny form like the miserable little insect you felt like. Wet, slimy flesh pressed into you at every second, forcing your sodden form ever deeper into the princess's body. After what felt like an eternity but was in reality only seconds, you dropped into the princess's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft half-blind and very disoriented from your trip down the princess's throat, you could only blink dumbly as the space around you abruptly opened up. Given your size relative to the princess's stomach, you only fell what felt like a few feet, and you bounced roughly on the spongy surface at the \"base\" of your fleshy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlailing your limbs, you staggered to your feet and attempted to find dry ground. Unfortunately for you, the large mouthful of water the princess had swallowed had left a pool of water roughly waist deep around you, which was rapidly becoming \"room temperature\" in your humid environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here you were, soaking wet, terrified, and just beginning to fight off the disorientation clouding your mind while being trapped in an organ only about five times your total size. The air around you was humid and foul-smelling, and the internal temperature of Eirika's body was only making your current situation worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart-racing, you began to think over your hellish predicament. Was there a way out of this nightmare? As disgusting as it was to think about, Eirika's back door was one option for escape. Given that the stomach was currently empty save for you and the pool of water you stood in, her gastric juices were going to remain dormant for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, not too far above your head was the sphincter you had just been ejected from. Given the difficulty and amount of effort Eirika had put in to swallow you, you weren't sure if you were actually small enough to fit through either exit of the stomach unaided. That was a sobering thought; if you were even just a little too big to fit through either sphincter you were as good as trapped inside this nightmarish prison until your undignified end. Unless something happened to alter Eirika's body, or she swallowed something that you could use as a tool you likely wouldn't even be able to force one of the sphincters open on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least for now the water you were standing in was clean, and you could breathe without difficulty (though you didn't want too, the air stunk!) You could only hope that the stomach remained free of gastric juices until you had a means of escape or protection (neither of which looked very likely right now.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Like, not super bad, but it was definitely uncomfortable for you. Eirika's stomach was definitely a little bloated from the size of her meal (probably from a combination of both the amount of food she'd eaten as well as the speed she'd eaten it at.) You could feel a significant amount of air bubbles shifting in Eirika's packed tummy behind you, the feeling of them rolling, shifting, and pressing against the taut stomach walls creating an almost unusual massaging sensation. You would have actually enjoyed the mildly soothing feeling if Eirika's stomach wasn't so darn full. It felt like the princess had swallowed something entirely solid, her belly was as firm and hard as a rock to the touch, with barely any give to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess evidently thought that she was full too, pressing one hand to her rock hard tummy and not feelin the hand sink in at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Phew* My, that was filling!

I must say, that meal really hit the spot! It might be a little crass of me to say so, but a hard day on the battlefield always makes me hungry!\" Continuing to rub her full tummy, the princess cooed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... how's that feel, little guy? Because I'm sure enjoying this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to admit it, but after being stretched out by Eirika's filled-to-the-brim stomach her rubbing actually felt like a soothing massage to you. Rather than answer her, you wriggled a little at feeling her hand directly rubbing the patch of her belly that you occupied. You hadn't meant anything buy it, just trying to get more comfortable, but your faint movements had dislodged a bubble of air in Eirika's tight tummy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Buuurp* Oh my, excuse me! You know little man, its rude to make a woman burp like that!\" Rolling your nonexistant eyes at Eirika's comment (unlike earlier when she thought you'd been looking up her skirt there wasn't any real heat to her words now), you just groused to yourself. The princess's cheeks had turned a faint pink at the rather unladylike burp she'd made, but what was she expecting would happen after eating such a large meal? At least she didn't seem mad at you anymore... As a whole the princess's mood seemed rather relaxed. You weren't sure what would happen to you now, because it didn't seem like Eirika was intent on moving anywhere anytime soon, even if she had finished eating. Maybe now that she was in a good mood you could convince her to help you?</span></div></div>",

The princess's cold words told you you'd get no sympathy from her, and watching whatever had aaaalmost dropped into your hands dissolving in the lake of acid told you that you that you were going to die in here. You may have been big enough to force the sphincter open (both of them, even though the entrance to her throat was currently out of your reach), but the only way to the princess's... lower exit, was through the steaming pool of acid. It may not've been very big, looking like a garden-sized pond to you at your two-inches-or-so of height, but you really didn't want to dive into that pond even if it was only for a short while. You'd likely only have the strength to make one attempt at forcing the sphincter open, and if it failed you'd be agonizingly melted into a flesh puddle. Kind of like a wax figurine dissolving under a heat lamp. Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, those were sobering thoughts. You were feeling surprisingly calm about all of this, especially falling your rage-quit from only a few minutes ago. You likely would've sat on the spongy 'shore' of the stomach, contemplating life, free will, and the meaning of existance until you expired had the princess not tripped over a rock at that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, what happened next was purely accidental. While the princess's words indicated that she felt no mercy in executing you in an exceedingly brutal manner, you'd never know for sure if she truly meant them or had only been trying to scare you into submission. Either way, as the princess stumbled and fell forwards, a look of startled alarm on her face, the contents of her stomach were sent bouncing around inside the fleshy sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had time to scream as the acid covered you, and as the princess righted herself you were sent tumbling back into the deepest point of her stomach along with the acid. While not deep, the acid was astonishingly powerful and made short work of you. Robbed of your strength and blinded by the pain, you could do nothing but thrash for a few moments before succumbing to the caustic liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------&lt;Unknown Time&gt; The Next Day-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to your senses an unknown amount of time later, you awoke to find that there was some kind of soft cloth covering you, and while you were no expert it felt more like cotton than anything else. The pristine white fabric, while not thin by any means did feel as if it were a little stretched around you. You attempted to sit up and gain a better view of where you were, but came to a startling discovery. You couldn't move! Doing your best to get your breaths under control... wait. You weren't breathing. You couldn't feel your lungs. In fact, you couldn't feel anything outside of a vague sense of self. You were existing, but you didn't seem to be able to move much on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Goddammit. You remembered now- that stupid, vain, princess had swallowed you whole. And all because you'd gotten an ACCIDENTAL look at her underwear. Speaking of the underwear that had brought about your doom, you were now pretty sure you knew where you were. Through the vague sense of self that remained in you, you were able to feel the soft, plush feeling of the flesh all around you as well as the smooth, soft fabric of the princess's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk about ironic. Even if it wasn't fair to you at all, you had to snort at this turn of events. Maybe somebody up there had a sick sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have eyes to close or open, but you could still somehow see everything around you... not that there was much for you to look at, with about 90% of your vision obscured by the princess's stretchy underwear. Rather than taking residence on what particular cheek or location of the princess's rear, you seemed to have assumed the form of a thick layer of flesh overtop the princess's originally modestly-sized backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been somewhere in the 2~4 inch range inside the princess's stomach, but right now it seemed like significantly more mass than that had been added to the princess's rear. Nothing huge by anyone's standards, but if you had to estimate you'd probably added an extra inch worth of padding to the princess's buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHah, serves her right. It wasn't much, but you'd take this minor win. Hopefully giving the princess a thicc, fat ass would cause her no small amount of headaches throughout her day. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sudden jolt sent you flying up into the air, bouncing you around against the soft walls of Eirika's stomach. The sizable (in comparison to you) pool of water around your waist was spread all around the stomach, with each jolt, bounce, and external movement, leaving you even more drenched and dazed than before. Unlike your passage down Eirika's throat, this new torment seemed to be unending, and you could only wonder when it would stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirika continued to run, swiftly putting distance between herself and the blank patch of grass where she had picked you up. The recently-ended skirmish had carried her much further from her comrades than she had initially believed, and she was in a hurry to get back to the safety of her camp. Having just driven the traitorous Carcino elder Pablo's mercenary forces from this region of the mercantile nation, she knew she had to do remain observant lest more of his loyalists ambush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran, her mind wandered to the tiny person in her stomach. Swallowing him had not been easy, and she had nearly choked when she had forced him down her throat. Now, she could feel him bouncing around in her stomach, and despite her earlier ire towards him she was overcome with worry. Maybe he had been telling the truth, and she had gulped down an innocent civilian in a fit of misguided anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a sharp halt, Eirika placed one hand over her cloth-covered belly, chewing her lip as she pondered her previous actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, she tried to imagine something her brother would say, something like \"A proper king or queen must never show regret for their actions! Each action must be accompanied by absolute certainty and unflinching resolve!\" Wincing, the princess sighed in consternation. The unpleasant taste of regret clung to her tongue, and she was quite sure that she had acted too hastily in punishing you for her believed slight. But she was a princess, a young woman who would one day rule over a nation of people, and she had to take responsibility for her own actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother had always said it was better to ask for forgiveness than permission, after all. After she let you out of her stomach, she would apologize for her unfair and unnecessarily harsh actions towards you, and then she would care for you until you used the counterspell to unshrink yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirika did, after all still firmly believe that you had used a magic spell on yourself. Being a fairly learned student of elder magic (what Lyon stated common folk knew as dark magic) she was aware of a shockingly wide school of spells, sorcery, and other black arts that could drastically alter a living human body. She had no reason to assume that you really were innocent of all suspicion and wrong-doing, she just didn't believe that you invading her privacy and attempting to peek at her underwear warranted such a harsh sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eirika neared the end of the mountain path that signaled the edge of her war-camp, she slowed to a graceful stroll. It wouldn't do for her comrades to see their princess in such a flustered state.</span></div></div>",

The Frelian knight had been a valuable companion ever since her king had pledged the woman's services to Eirika. While she wasn't the strongest fighter, her skills in the air and bond with her pegasus made her an excellent scout and rescuer. More than that, her bright, cheerful attitude never failed to lift Eirika's spirits after a long day of fighting, marching, or foraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothing her skirt beneath her, Eirika plopped her ample rear down next to her friend. Vanessa had called her over to the mess tent, and had evidently started eating before anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a late lunch, Vanessa? You know dinner isn't far off...\" Eirika pointed out, sending a bit of good-natured needling at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you know me! I'll be ready for food then too!\" Vanessa giggled at Eirika's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, thanks for joining me! You want something? There's plenty here but you're going to have to get your own plate. I'm not sharing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Eirika couldn't resist looking down at the veritable feast laid out before Vanessa. How anyone, a woman much less, could eat so much in one sitting was beyond her. If he were here, her brother would've likely teased her, saying that she could try to match Vanessa's legendary appetite bite-for-bite- but that was a stretch! She didn't eat thaaat much... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she sat thinking, her belly's occupant bouncing around within her reminded her that her stomach was completely empty save for him. Vanessa giggled cheerfully at the loud growl that emanated from the princess's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that answers my question! Grab some of the venison, Neimi brought it down herself and Franz prepared before the battle. Its sooo good!\" Vanessa moaned. She'd clearly been enjoying herself immensely- the array of meats, veggies, bread, and seasonings spread before her looked positively delectable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirika absentmindedly rubbed her grumbling tummy. Well, she didn't have to let you out right away... That's right, this was just part of your punishment! Giving you some company in there would ensure you thought twice about peeking at a girl's underwear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind made up, Eirika moved over to the multitude of trays laid out for the dinner rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Doreedo's note* Fun fact, one of Vanessa's supports in Sacred Stones states that one of her hidden skills is that she can out-eat anyone.</span></div></div>",

A giggled softly at her friend's antics. The plate that she was busily working through wasn't small by any means (and was in fact a little larger than average for her), but it didn't compare to the small feast that Vanessa had just consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating at a much steadier pace, Eirika smiled as she felt her stomach continue to fill up with food. She couldn't feel her 'passenger' jumping around inside of her, so he must've been buried by the internal avalanche of chewed up food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... it was a little unpleasant to think about, but it was his punishment! She couldn't show weakness here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she was planning on letting him out soon anyway- he wouldn't have to suffer his torment for much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Eirika!

The short, purple-haired girl looked deceptively meek and innocent. While it was true that she was something of a crybaby, the purplette was a master with the bow and arrow. Eirika wouldn't want to get on her bad side, the recently promoted Sniper knew how to end someone's life without ever alerting them to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's excellent! You and Franz have my compliments- the two of you are lifesavers! I don't know how any of us in this army would manage without the two of you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, you kid!

There's some woman yelling at you... \"Go away mom, I'm getting up...\" You mumble, rolling over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up groggily, rubbing your eyes. \"Huh? What's going on? Did something happen...?\" Your head aches, and your vision is blurry, like you just woke up from a nap that was far too short. After looking around for second, you realize, in shock, something did indeed happen.  You're in a giant room, with a giant girl staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who and what are you? I could have you put to death for spying on me in my room, you know!\" The purple haired girl looks down at you rather threateningly. It would be entirely convincing, but you can see the vaguest of upturns at the edge of her lip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...who are YOU?\" You're completely befuddled. This entire situation makes no sense! A giant, purple haired girl, in an old-timey dress and in an old-timey room... what in the world is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems truly annoyed now, however, like the thought that you don't recognize her is unthinkable. She seems a good bit more convincingly angry now... hopefully she isn't actually angry... \"You mean you don't know? I'm the Apostle, Sanaki! How would you not know about me? It doesn't matter - who and what are you? Some kind of Laguz?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization of where you are hits you like a ton of bricks. 'Am I really in... Path of Radiance? How in the world did I end up in my game? ...And shrunk, no less? And... in... Sanaki's room?' All of these questions race through your head, but you know just sitting there won't get you any answers. Not too mention the gigantic girl glaring daggers at you seems to think you were spying on her. Considering who she is, that isn't the best possible impression... It'd be best to come up with some kind of cover story, quickly...<br>\r\n\"I'm, uh... I, uh, don't really remember. I remember that I'm a human, yeah, and that I'm supposed to be regular sized, like you, but... I can't remember my name, or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You do realize how good I am at telling when someone is lying, correct? I deal with misleading nobles all of the time. I know you know your name, and I'm certain you know a good bit more than you're letting on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting to sweat... But, telling her the truth would just make it worse, wouldn't it? \"I swear, I don't know how I ended up here, or how I became so tiny! Please, don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... well, you seem to be telling the truth on that account.\" For the first time, you see her start to crack a smile. \"As long as you're willing to behave, I'm certain we can both entertain each other quite well. Life in the palace is horribly dull, and I am always looking for diversions... I'm certain you have no objections, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...It probably wouldn't be a good idea to have objections. You just hope that this entertainment isn't something dangerous...</span></div></div>",

It feels like you're sleeping on the floor, in fact. You run your hand against the surface beneath you. Yep, that's a carpet. Did you fall off of bed? You'll have to actually wake up all the way and open your eyes to know for sure. You reluctantly do so, rubbing your eyes and sitting up groggily. You open your eyes to see... Not your room. The walls and ceiling are painted stone, the furniture is extremely fine woodwork, and the floor is covered in a colourful carpet. It was like a room in some medieval castle. But this room seems...large in a weird way. you stand all the way up and are instantly shocked to see your perspective not change at all. You're still low to the floor somehow. That's impossible, you think. The only way this could happen is if you were... about an inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is derailed suddenly by a rhythmic booming noise, slowly growing louder. The ground shakes and the massive wooden door in front of you swings open. A titanic woman clad in crimson and gold armour stands in front of you. Her deep red hair reaches to her shoulders, creating a bold frame for her strikingly beautiful face. Your staring was interrupted by a voice coming from the hallway. \"Commander Minerva, a moment, please. I have a report to make.\" The red titan, whose name seems to be Minerva, replies to the voice. \"Very well Catria. State your report.\" She turns around to face the voice, which resulted in you getting an excellent view of her big, round backside, which was held in well-fitting dark red medieval-style pants. \"The troops have finished preparations for the journey to the wyvern's dale. We await your command. \"Excellent. Tell everyone we will move out in three days.\" \"Yes, commander.\" More rhythmic booms come from the hallway as the girl leaves. Minerva turns back around and closes the door. She's now facing in your direction, and she...</span></div></div>",

And her face... is looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she spotted you? at the size of an ant, you thought you were safe from being detected. But her eyes seemed to lock with yours. Swiftly, she takes two short steps forward, closing the entire distance between you within a mere moment. Her index finger and thumb pinched you from either side and lifted you into the air at great speed. When the ride stopped you were face-to-face with an incredibly angry giant who could easily squish you like a bug if she applied just a tiny bit more pressure. \"Who are you? What are you doing in here? Are you some sort of spy? Or are you just trying to peek on me? How did you get this small?\" The barrage of questions from the booming voice of your captor catches you off guard for a moment, but you regain your composure and manage to interject. \"Hey, hey, I'm not a spy, I'm not trying to peek, I don't know how I got this small, I just woke up and I was on the ground here, reduced to an inch tall. I swear, I wasn't trying to do anything.\" You stare at the angry face in front of you, hoping you explanation was satisfactory to the woman holding you in her grasp.</span></div></div>",

There's a pause that lasts for a few moments, but to you, it felt much longer, as the anticipation builds of what your captor's reaction will be. Finally, she does something. She sighs, her expression softens, her grip on you loosens, and then she looks at you. \"I... suppose I was a bit accusatory there. Even if you were a spy or something I can't really see why anyone would willingly shrink themselves like this, after all, you could get stepped on.\" \"Yeah, trust me. Being this size is a little difficult.\" Minerva chuckled at your unintentional wordplay. She placed you in her palm and sat down on the bed. Staring up at Minerva, her face took up most of your vision, but thankfully her expression was not so angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't have any idea how you got here or how you got this small?\" \"No, the last thing I remember is going to bed at night, and when I woke up, I was here.\" \"That's a conundrum indeed. Well, it isn't particularly safe for you to be walking around on your own at this size, so how about you stay here with me and I'll personally keep you safe?\" \"I'd really appreciate that, thank you.\" \"Excellent. Now, it's getting quite late, so I need to go to sleep. That means I need to change into my nightwear.\" She stands up, places you on the nightstand, and looks at you with a serious expression. \"I trust that you can promise not to look while I get changed.\" \"Yeah, Of course.\" \"Good.\" She walks to the large wooden dresser and you turn around to make sure you don't peek. Sounds of armour being unbuckled and clothes moving about reach your ears. You think to yourself, maybe one little look wouldn't hurt. As your head begins to turn, you snap it forward again. This woman just offered you protection in your time of need, and she had already shown you her angry side. Pissing her off would be a bad idea. Besides, it was just plain rude. So you kept your back turned, like you promised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of time passes and you hear her large footsteps come towards you, but softer this time as she had removed her metal boots. \"Alright, you can look now, little one.\" You turn around to have your eyes meet a wall of red fabric. You look up to see her face sporting a warm smile. She looked beautiful in her nightgown. It was a muted red with some light orange designs adorning it near the neck opening, shoulders, and the ends of the sleeves. The orange designs were similar in shape to the swirling gold patterns on her armour. \"Well don't stare too long, your eyes will dry out.\" the voice of your giant protector broke the trance you didn't even know you were in. \"Oh, sorry about that.\" \"Don't worry about it, not every day you see a giant, after all. Now come here.\" She places her hand on the nightstand, signaling you to get on. You climb onto her hand, and she uses her other hand to snuff out the last candle lighting the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she crawls into bed with you still in her hand. You fully expected her to put down some sort of cloth as a makeshift bed for you or something. Minerva gets under her blanket, then places you atop her chest, putting her hands on top of you. \"Goodnight, little one.\" \"Uh... Yeah, goodnight.\" Minerva's hands make for an effective blanket, you're quite comfortable, and soon find yourself drifting off to sleep, despite the fact you woke up only a short while ago, that felt like a sleep which was interrupted halfway by the light and uncomfortable floor, so getting a proper nights rest would be great. Your eyes close, and you fall asleep atop your new protector's chest.</span></div></div>",

A great weight is lifted off of you as she pushes herself up, propping up her upper body with her arms. Her hair has been messed up quite a bit during the night.

Almost immediately the woman's fingers loosen, sending you tumbling onto her palm. You gasp for air, greedily taking in as much as possible in case this girl decided to repeat her crushing trick.

You attempt to keep your breathing as low as possible, all the while praying to your higher deity of choice that the titanic red knight didn't see you. You wait a moment. You hear buckles being undone and metal armour being dropped to the ground with a loud thud. If she's continuing as normal, then it stands to reason that she never saw you. However, sticking your head out just a tad to check couldn't hurt, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly work your way forward to the edge of the bedside table, making sure to keep to the shadows. You stop your advance when you reach the point where you can see the gargantuan woman's entire body. It seems that you took a peek at the right time as when you look up, you see the woman removing her shirt, placing it in a basket to be washed later. Her pants soon follow, and you see a sight you could only have dreamed before now. A woman the size of a high-rise building stood in front of you clad in nothing but a red bra and matching panties. Looking up at her was dizzying, but the view was more than worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes follow the motions of her well toned legs as she walks around the room, snuffing out the candles which once illuminated the room. The snuffing of the final candle saddened you, as it removed the amazing view of her body from your line of sight. Based on context and sound, you assume she then crawled into the extravagant bed at the side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes adjust to the dark after a moment, it quickly changes your opinion about the candle snuffing from earlier. The giant woman must've been quite tired, to the point where she didn't even bother to get under the covers. You could clearly see her now thanks to the moonlight. But that moonlight, the way it illuminated her body was somehow even more beautiful than the candlelight. Her breasts, thighs, and abs seemed to shine in the soft, blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant appeared to have already fallen asleep, and her body looked so inviting. Surely it would be fine to explore a bit, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, after all. After a moment, you decide on exploring...</span></div></div>",

You live here?\" You asked confused, as the woman started walking in your direction, each of her footsteps pressing the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, how do you found this place?\" The woman asked.

She lifted her faces to look at you, her nose and mouth were visible, alongside some lock of her purple hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, despite be a bit smaller than you, her presence was intimidating \"Im just lost... sorry to disturb, i want to go away\" you explained, smiling a bit to don't look suspicious to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost, huh?\" A slight smile was painted in her lips \"What unfortunate human...\" she slowly extended one of her slender arms to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...\" her palm was now a bit near your face \"...mean?...

Only refer to your character in the second person (ex: YOU looked up. YOU told her YOUR name) you get the point by now. <br>\r\n3- I'm mostly going to be including only the Fire Emblem games released outside of Japan, though there will be options for the others that weren't.<br>\r\n4- Though most fetishes will be allowed please try to refrain from insertion, death, and digestion(though they are okay, don't overuse them). Mouthplay and vore (strictly oral) is completely fine.<br>\r\n5- No male/male interaction please, although the girls can interact with them, that is fine!<br>\r\n6- Your character is roughly 2-4 inches tall. Please keep it in that range and refrain from altering the size of anyone or anything else. <br>\r\n7- The girls can be whatever kind of giantess you want: kind, cruel, playful or apathetic, but give them a good reason to be those things and please try to keep them in character.<br>\r\n8- PLEASE use decent grammar and punctuation and keep the story in English. <br>\r\n9- Try to refrain from killing you or your giantess off or ending the story early, if you do, give another option for a different outcome.<br>\r\n10- Though I will allow a short chapter once in a while, I will delete if you post nothing but one or 2 sentence chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more thing: One of the main mechanics of Fire Emblem games is building relationships between the characters, this is also one of the main mechanics of this story. Build your relationship with one(or more) of the girls as the story progresses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGPs for good additions!
