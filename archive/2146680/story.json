Power unlike any Twili had seen before. She could manipulate a mortal's mind, alter someone's body however she wished, reform the world however she wanted, even view into other timelines! And yet... she's bored. Being a god isn't always that great. It didn't take long for her to see just about everything. At least, what she <i>thought</i> was everything. She had yet to do anything really bad with her powers, and she wanted to see how much fun creating she could have with an enemy. And, she knew just the person to make into an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was no ordinary man. He had a courage unseen in most people. Having someone like that try to fight her, that could be the best thing! If she won, she could enjoy the struggle Link put up. If she lost, then that means there's just something else she could strive for with her powers! Now, first, she had to decide which Link. Her powers revealed to her multiple worlds, and multiple Links. Any of them could be fun. But which one would be more fun?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once the enemies had been changed, Midna smiled and sat back to watch the fight. Link soon exited the cave and traveled deeper into the woods. It wasn\u2019t long before he encountered a redead. Link hesitated at the sight. He knew the woods could be dangerous but he had never seen anything like this. He started to approach it when it suddenly shrieked, paralyzing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink struggled to move, thinking about how dangerous this thing was. Before he could react, the monster raised its weapon and delivered a mighty blow on him. The hero fell to the ground, very injured. When Midna saw this, she thought for a moment. She had wanted to see Link struggle but this was too fast. After a moment, she sighed. The woman raised her hand and healed him. As Link was trying to figure out what just happened to him, he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only help you\u2019re going to get for this fight so be prepared this time. If you really want to defeat this thing, find its weakness.\u201d Midna whispered to him. Link had no idea where the voice came from but nodded and looked at the redead once more. After a moment, he soon realized it was actually pretty slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink moved behind it and approached. It screamed once more, paralyzing him again. This time though, it didn\u2019t have enough time to turn around. By the time it did, Link regained movement and struck at the beast. He continued this process until the monster was defeated. Link smiled and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually made his way out of the fog into a clearing. In his path stood two more redeads. Link thought about this carefully before coming up with a plan. He ran to their side and approached. Midna wondered what he was up to. When he was paralyzed, the monsters raised their weapons. Before the one in front of Link could hit him though, the other one brought down its weapon without thinking and hit its ally. The redead went flying to the ground, gravely injured. Link charged at it and finished it off before it could get up. Link soon finished the other one and continued chasing Talo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Midna watched him, she smiled. His plan before had been brilliant and was something she hadn\u2019t thought of. She decided to make the next challenge a little harder by making the redeads a bit faster. When the hero got to Talo and the monkey, he encountered 3 of them quickly learned of their new speed. He started dodging their attacks, keeping an eye on all of them. In the process, the monsters ended up hitting one of them off the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother redead screamed and ended up hitting Link in the chest, causing him to fall backwards. This time the damage wasn\u2019t as bad, but it still hurt a lot, making Link slower. As Link struggled, Talo couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonkey, you need to help him!\u201d Talo said. The ape nodded and struck at the cage. She did this a few times before it eventually broke. With the two redeads distracted, it gave the monkey time to jump onto one of them and block their sight. The monster screamed, paralyzing the monkey but couldn\u2019t get it off. Link used this opportunity to strike at the redead, finishing it off. Once there was only one left, Link didn\u2019t have much trouble taking it down, finishing the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talo and Link started walking back, Midna clapped silently. She was impressed by his performance and wondered how he would do next time. As she watched, her two wolves appeared behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, why did you help him before? I thought we were going to cause him trouble.\u201d Amy said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did cause him trouble. He had a harder time this time. And anyways, this challenge was just the beginning of what we\u2019ll throw at him.\u201d Midna said. Amy still wasn\u2019t entirely convinced, causing Midna to sigh. \u201cListen, don\u2019t question my decision. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d The two wolves nodded and disappeared from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Midna appeared in Link\u2019s bedroom. She quietly approached her sleeping friend and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did well today. For that, I\u2019ll reward you.\u201d She said softly. Using her magic, the woman healed Link\u2019s wounds. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you, I\u2019m happy to be back. Today was just the start though. You\u2019ll face challenges far greater than what happened today, and I\u2019ll be by your side the whole time\u2026in a way.\u201d Midna leaned in and gave him a kiss. \u201cSleep well Link. You\u2019ll have a busy day tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Link got ready for his trip to Hyrule Castle, Midna used her magic to see what would happen next (despite being his partner for this adventure, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure what happened before they met). She saw that King Bulblin would arrive soon and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, I remember him.\u201d She said to herself. The woman decided to change him up a bit for the future. The first thing she did was turn the king into a female. She then made her more fit and beautiful. \u201cNow she\u2019ll be stronger and harder to resist.\u201d The last thing Midna did was make Queen Bulblin a bit more cruel to both her enemies and her minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twili smiled at her work and started to watch, thinking about what she should change next. Link soon reached Illia, Colin, and Epona. As Illia spoke to Link, Midna started to feel a bit jealous. After all, she lived in the same world as Link which meant Illia spent more time with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was ruined when the two board charged through the gate. Midna watched as Link was knocked out just before their leader appeared. The woman chuckled as the monster stopped next to Link, not realizing he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this is it: the location of the final spirit.\u201d Queen Bulblin said. She raised her horn and blew into it, making a dark portal appear above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress, we got some interesting catches. Can we keep them?\u201d One of the Bulblins asked, holding Colin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019ll leave the kids somewhere to die. However, give me her.\u201d The queen pointed to Illia. When the monster had her in hand, she gave the unconscious girl a taste. The queen moaned before licking her lips. Midna flinched as Illia started to enter the hungry mouth. After a moment, she sighed and decided to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t eat her. You\u2019ll eventually encounter a stronger prey, one more tasty than her.\u201d Midna whispered to the queen. The woman hesitated before tossing Illia onto one of the boars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take her for now. She\u2019s not worth eating.\u201d The monsters all charged out, leaving Link on the ground. When he woke up, he looked around and realized what happened. He started to run after them, soon encountering the twilight realm. Before he could react, a shadow beast pulled him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna immediately hesitated when she saw the beast. It was, after all, one of her people corrupted by Zant. Zant\u2026that name still sparked fury inside Midna. She wanted to destroy him right there and then for everything he had done and was going to do. She decided to wait though. After all, it could lead to a fun opportunity for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Link transformed into a wolf, Midna followed behind, she knew her past self was also following and was careful to avoid her. The twili followed Link all the way to Hyrule Castle and watched as he was chained up. Midna decided that if she was going to change something, now would be the best time while Link was unconscious and her past self was still hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought carefully about this. One idea she had was telling her past self what was going on and let her in on the fun in some way. It might also be interesting to see how her past self would react to some challenges that her future self would create. Midna took a second to rub her head. Thinking about a past and future self was a bit confusing. After a moment, she eventually decided on\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was just about to confront the wolf she had been chasing when she was suddenly teleported. Imp Midna quickly noticed her future self and became angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this some kind of a joke? Who are you?\u201d Past Midna demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m you from the future. I want to talk to you.\u201d Future Midna responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProve it.\u201d Future Midna nodded and grabbed her cursed shackle necklace. She showed it to her, causing the imp girl\u2019s eyes to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI keep it as a reminder of what happened to us.\u201d Past Midna started to calm down and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one you were about to approach is a hero and a friend. However, in my time, I\u2019ve gained tremendous power. With it, I plan to have fun and mess with him. To do this, I came up with an idea, to switch places with you. You can relax while I help out our people.\u201d Future Midna explained. Her past self thought about it for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea how her future self got here or how she obtained the power. However, if she was telling the truth, her future self would easily be able to save her people and stop Zant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then. I guess I\u2019ll trust you.\u201d Imp Midna said. Her future self smiled and opened a portal for her, taking Imp Midna to a pocket dimension where she could hang out and have her own fun. Once her past self was gone, Midna smiled and appeared before Link, startling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there. My name is Midna and I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d She said. Link stared at her, unsure of what to do. The woman was very beautiful and appeared out of nowhere. The Twili approached him, lightly scratching Link\u2019s chin. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, I\u2019ll be giving you extra challenges on your adventure. If you decide to work with me on this, I promise you will survive. If you choose to fight me, the consequences won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d Link started to growl at her. He just wanted his friends to be safe. He tried to bite her, making the woman sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand and transformed him into a mouse. The boy started to freak out when he saw what she did. She now towered over him like a castle. Before he could react, Midna picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to fight me. I have the power to do anything I want to you.\u201d She said. Her stomach suddenly growled, making Link squirm. Midna thought about tasting him as a lesson of her power. After thinking about it though, she believed the point had gotten through. She set him down and transformed him back. \u201cSo, will you work with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink hesitated before nodding. Though he knew she would make things harder, he knew didn\u2019t have much of a choice. The hero just hoped she would keep him safe like she said. Once Midna had his answer, she smiled and helped him out of the cage. Once he was free, Midna sat on his back. She was quite heavy but nothing Link couldn\u2019t handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright little wolf, let\u2019s get moving.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As she got to a dark cave, she thought about all of the changes she could make, and the fact that there were so many masks made it even better. However, she decided an immediate change was in order. Of course, she decided that she should change Link's initial appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was chasing after the Skull Kid, bearing a heart-shaped mask, and floating above the ground as he floated away. The Link chased the creature into a hole, where, as he fell through, he saw numerous strange figures resembling bright paintings. Some he recognized, some he didn't. After a fall, he found himself upon a large, pink flower. He got to his feet, and looked around, spying a large pond. And at the other end was that Skull Kid. Midna watched as the normal events played out, up until the Skull Kid cast his curse. Then, she changed things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily, Link would be transformed into a Deku Scrub, and forced to live out the next three days as one. However, instead of turning into a Deku, the hero began to shrink down, his body becoming covered in a light-green fur. The spell had turned the hero into a pup. Midna couldn't help but chuckle. She recalled how her Link would be turned into a wolf whenever he was in contact with Twilight... maybe the size of the Link determined how big the dog was. She couldn't help but chuckle about how difficult the hero's adventure might turn out now. Similarly, the Skull Kid was laughing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laughed, he floated backwards, passing through a large door with one of the black fairies in tow. He passed through, and it closed, blocking off Tatl. Familiarly, the fairy couldn't open it up, so she teamed up with Link, who could actually open up the door. This would already be a challenge for the hero, but perhaps the little guy should be shown an alpha. With a wave of her index finger, April and May spawned near the end of the path ahead of Link, with the orders to rough up Link. Now, how'd they go about it?</span></div></div>",

And, sure enough, they could hear the tingle of a certain fairy approaching, meaning that adventurer must be near. They sat, waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, that green wolf came into view. Link was looking around, curious, and was even more confused when he spied the twili wolves. He'd been familiar with wolfos, and normal wolves. But these ones bore fur as black as shadow, pur white underbellies, and strange, neon etchings scattered about their bodies. They were also extraordinarily elegant, their frames appearing thin, yet towering over the puppified hero. They were unlike anything Link'd ever seen, mystical like fairies, yet they seemed drenched in some sort of deviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two got up off of her rump, and walked around Link to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, what have we here?\" the one going behind Link said. \"Some ignorant rascal decided to wander onto our turf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's trying to intrude on our quarters,\" the one still sitting said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are you guys?\" Tatl said, confused.

It was unusual \u2014 it had hollowed, half-circle eyes carved into the wood. A twisted, circular snout protruded from its wooden features. Two thin twigs jutted from its sides like a pair of spindly arms. It seemed to be an effigy of a deku scrub: a diminutive plant-like creature with wooden skin and eyes that glowed like enkindled wood. An aura of sadness seemed to extrude from its very wood. Link expected to pass it right by, but after it caught his eye, he couldn\u2019t seem to pull them away. It felt familiar, in a distant sense. For some reason, he couldn\u2019t but help but think of himself when he looked at the tree \u2014 even though he had nothing in common with it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Tatle said floating above and just to the left of Link\u2019s right ear, \u201cit looks all dark and gloomy... almost like it could start crying any second now.\u201d There was a moment of silence before Tatl noticed something.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA mask!\u201d she said. \u201cRight there, by the roots!\u201d Indeed, there was a mask. It was of a deku scrub \u2014 alive and not a twisted effigy like the tree that stood above it. The mask laid face up, half-turned away from the heroic duo. Curiously, Link swore it was not there a second ago. Nevertheless, he approached it and picked it up in his jaws. It tasted like bark, shedding light on its composition.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really life-like.\u201d Tatl said, hovering an inch away from the mask\u2019s wooden surface.

Maybe it\u2019ll be useful for something!\u201d With a nod and a muffled bark, Link agreed and they continued their journey.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The heroic duo marched through the stone tunnel and into a strange, twisting passage.

They were most certainly underground: in the basement of Clock Town\u2019s greatest work.<br>\r\nThere was a wooden ramp that lead upwards. Link approached it, confidently setting a paw on the cool, dampened wood. It creaked ominously. The sound eerily echoed across the hard stone interior.

Saria was immediately confused when she appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Saria asked, a little nervous. To Ben honest, she had been inside the great deku tree before, but the web was completely new, and Saria could tell something bad was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce Link gets stuck here, you are going to tease and humiliate him.\u201d Midna said. Saria stared at Midna. Her clothing was a bit weird, she didn\u2019t wear any shoes and some of her skin was exposed (like her bellybutton). Midna\u2019s beauty made Saria a little jealous. It took her a moment though to realize what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not going to tease him. Did Mido ask you to do this? That bum! I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so mean.\u201d Saria said, planning to yell at Mido later. However, Midna laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you think someone sent me here? How amusing. I\u2019m not doing this because I was told to, I\u2019m doing this because I want to have fun. And you will tease Link.\u201d Midna said waving her hand. Saria\u2019s head started to hurt, and she didn\u2019t know why. Soon, she no longer had control over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes princess.</i>\u201d Saria said, though she was trying to fight it (and completely failing).<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nLink soon jumped off the platform towards the web.

He tried to struggle, but it didn\u2019t help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Don\u2019t try to fight this Link. You are currently my prisoner, my toy, my servant.</i>\u201d Saria\u2019s voice appeared. Link looked up to see his friend. He could tell something was off though just from looking at her eyes (and she seemed to be barefoot). Saria walked closer. \u201c<i>What shall I do first?

Amy (green), Beth (blue), Joelle (red), and Meg (purple). But this wasn't enough for Midna. The four of them were power, but she wanted Link humiliated, and just four floating rags weren't going to do that. She had to make some modifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she went about altering their bodies. Amy, being the youngest, was given the body of a 13-year-old, not much in endowments, but very cute. Beth got the body of a young adult, her assets filling out nicely, bit also gaining a six-pack. Joelle got the body of a 21-year-old, with a nice hourglass form. Meg was a bona-fide milf, with a 35 year-old's body, her breasts were nearing F-cups and her ass matched, she also packed on a couple of pounds, giving her some chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she made each of them want to dominate Link in various ways. Amy wanted to play games with Link, putting him in compromising positions along the way. Beth was extremely horny, and would want to rock the young boy's world. Joelle was a bit of a tomboy, and wanted to make Link her personal stink slut. Meg would smother the boy with her endowments, tormenting him further. \"Okay ladies, have fun and give me a good show.\" Midna vanishes, leaving the four girls to lie in wait for the hero to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had acquired the slingshot. Now he was ready to tackle the lower levels of the Great Deku Tree. All he had to do was jump from this ledge, through that spider web covering that hole in the floor, and land in the water. Link makes a running leap off the ledge, breaking through the web and falling, only to stop. He turned his head to see he was trapped in a much larger web. He looked up to see that he had in fact gone in the hole, so where did this web come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis time for questioning was cut short as he heard giggling all around him. Looking around, her saw four girls appear from different directions, surrounding the boy. Judging by their sudden appearance and the fact that they were floating, Link could only assume they were some kind of ghosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sisters, looks like we've caught a fly in our web.\" The purple one says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and a cute fly too.\" Said the green one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how cute he is when I'm done with him.\" Said the red one with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm but you have to admit, he looks like a tasty looking man.\" Said the blue one with a finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sisters, who's first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After expending most of his seeds and getting smooched by the (admittedly cute) ghost girl every time he missed, Link finally had it! He couldn't lose, especially since her challenge was so simple; some hero he could be if he couldn't even aim at anything that wasn't a sitting duck. The problem was that she was <i>way</i> too fast, and she knew where he was shooting from at all times. How could he slow her down long enough to pull a win...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was pondering this, the ghost blew a kiss to him. What he didn't expect was the kiss to become tangible, fly over, and land on his cheek. Being caught off guard by it, he blushed even more intensely than when she first kissed him. Instead of disappearing, it continued to plant itself against his face and press down. After a few seconds of stunned embarrassment, Link ripped it off of him and threw it away, the ghoul in front of him to giggling to herself all the while. She made a kissy face at him, but was merciful enough to not summon a pair of lips again. As oddly pleasant as it was being pecked by this girl, it was starting to get a bit too distracting. Wait a minute...That's it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grabbed one of the few seeds left in his pouch and loaded it into his slingshot. The ghost girl smiled coyly at him and stood still, same as the last twenty-something times; meanwhile, the adventurer in green pretended like he was concentrating on landing a shot, when he was really trying to whiff it. When he launched, she just dodged to the side like usual, and came in to collect her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Link gripped his slingshot and stood still until the last possible second. Right when the ghost closed her eyes and puckered up, he swayed to the side so she missed him, snatching a seed from his bag and tossing it into his slingshot hand in the process; then, when she was turning to smooch him, he grabbed her by the waist with his free hand and smashed his lips into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had no idea how to react; she felt exactly like he did when he got his first kiss stolen by her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed his lips along hers; she's really taught him a lot about kissing, after all! He was just following her example. This did nothing to lessen the blush on his face, or the fact that he was kind of getting into it himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gah! Stop it, Link, you've got a challenge to fulfill! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling himself out of his kiss-induced daze, Link went in for the kill, running his tongue across the ghost girl's lower lip. \"Nnngh...Ah!\" She moaned, melting into his embrace. Her eyes lidded, and eventually closed completely as she reciprocated the lip-lock she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his chance! Wrapping his free arm around her waist, he loaded the seed into his slingshot, pushed her away, and fired at her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wai-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWW!\" Amy yelped, rubbing her head, which now had a comically large bump on it. Link pumped his arm in success. \"H-hey! No fair!\" she huffed, crossing her arms and pouting. Link couldn't help but think she was really cute like this. \"Y-you cheated! You tricked me! That doesn't count...\" she ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink explained to her that he didn't break any rules; all he had to do was hit the target with his seedling, and he most certainly did just that. Amy tried to come up with something to stop him from progressing, but she couldn't; he was absolutely right. He won (not so) fair and square, and there was nothing she could do about it. \"Fine...you can go ahead and meet my sisters, I guess...\" she sighed and hung her head, moping to herself. Link could've sworn that he heard her mutter 'jerk' under her breath. He felt hurt, but in a sense, he supposed she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Link do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opening the door, Link was confused at what he saw. It was a large open room. It had a long, red carpet down the center leading to an alter, with rows of benches on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be someone standing at the alter at the end of the room. It looked like a woman with a veil and white dress and holding a bouquet of flowers. As Link entered, he heard some kind of music playing from nowhere. He hesitantly drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman at the alter turned to him and lifted her veil. Link gasped as he saw it was the poe girl, now sporting green lipstick. \"Hi there my new husband. Welcome to your wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWedding?! Link didn't want to get married, especially not to a ghost girl. He turned around to try and run back out the door to come in, only to see several dozen more of her in identical attire. \"By the way honeybunch, since this is all being done by my ghost powers, I'm technically not breaking any rules. Now it's time for you to kiss the brides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room filled with giggles before the mob of ghost girls begin to close in on the hero, all making audible smooching sounds. Link began to panic as he was slowly encircled and trapped. He needed to get back to that door, quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does that go for him?</span></div></div>",

Steeling himself, he prepares to charge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink closed his eyes and ran head first into the mob, hoping his reckless attack would catch them off guard and give him an opening. Those hopes were dashed however, when he felt several sets of hands grab his arms and pull him to the ground. He opens his eyes to see a dozen of them holding him down. Then, the original Amy came into view above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww. What a good husband, running right into the waiting arms of his wives. Okay girls, lets give him some kisses.\" Link struggled at the idea of this horde kissing him simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original clapped her hands on his cheeks and leaned in, her green lips puckered  as she planted a wet kiss on his lips. Link's face went red from embarassment as she popped off. He didn't have time to ponder on his shame, however, as the rest of her copies dove in after her lead and burued him in a sea of green smooches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the small gaps between the Amys, Link saw the door beginning to close. If that door closed, Link would be trapped here and lose the contest, leaving him trapped with her for the rest of his life... possibly longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Link get free?</span></div></div>",

Another chill and his clothes were replaced with a small tuxedo. The Amy clones helped him up and led him towards the alter, as the aisles were filled with clones of Amy\u2019s sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding opposite to his wife-to-be, there was a flash of magic as a women he had never seen before appeared behind the podium, her beautiful orange hair framing her face and falling down past her black robes.

The audience cheered and wedding bells chimed,  even as Link felt the last vestiges of resistance fade, as magic molded his mind to love Amy back, a little trick Midna did as she didn\u2019t want Link to suffer a loveless marriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony finished, the new couple separated, smiling at each other as they held hands and walked/floated down the aisle, towards the door that had reappeared.

Seeing that the other sisters lost their chance of playing with Link for now. So, the Poes vanished from view, disappearing from sight, but Link's vision was quickly filled with the buxom beast herself, Beth, who rubbed up against him, straddling her legs over his lap. She leaned in, a wide grin on her face as Link tried to lean away from her, the web making such a feat impossible. Soon, Beth was uncomfortably close to his face... And then the first smooch was planted against his cheek, her bottom half wobbling on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were a nightmare for the young hero, the buff lady forcing smooch after smooch on his vulnerable face while her butt rubbed on his groin, to and fro, side to side. The whole endeavor was making him feel... Weird. He felt an intense desire, his manhood beckoning for more of Beth's punishment while his mind begged her to stop. Thankfully, after one long smooch, she got off of him, leaving him to pant, his cheeks burning up. She giggled as she leaned back, floating in air, before resting one of her feet on Link's face, an oddly sensual feeling to the way her toes wriggled on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, almost did ya in before the game started~\" she cooed out. She then leaned back more, and now her other foot was on the hero's face, both covering his vision, all while making his aching manhood throb for some reason. \"Now, the game. It's a bit of a game of ownership. If one of us Poes win, little ol' you will be a sort of pet to us. And lemme tell you, looking at you is making me wanna teach you all sorts of tricks~! I could teach you to beg, teach you to lick, teach you to whine, teach you where to stick your juicy bits~\" As she listed the various things she wanted to do to Link, she swayed her feet side to side, shaking Link's head along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but first I've gotta beat you. And to beat you, well... Let's say we get ourselves a best of 5 competition. Whoever pleasures the other enough 3 times first wins. Ya hear that? If you wanna be my pet, you just gotta let me do everything I want to that little prick of yours~ I'm gonna remove you from this web, and then dump you onto the floor. And then... you better get ready, little boy~!\" With that, she removed her feet, letting Link take in some fresh air finally. He felt dizzy from her position, and couldn't quite see straight. However, he was able to hear her terms. He didn't quite know what she meant by \"pleasuring\" the other enough, which'd likely give this lady an advantage. But there was no way he'd be made into a toy. He couldn't let her touch him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And yet, why did that talk of being her pet make him ache more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the web vanished, and Link fell down. He landed on his feet, and stood up. He felt the urge to cross his legs, like that'd protect some shame of his. He scanned around, fearful of Beth. He held his sword threateningly and scanned around and around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, the Poe was coming in from behind. It seemed while the hero was scared, she was formualting just what she wanted to do to him first. She came in close. Closer and closer.

Though, a light chuckle behind him told him he was already too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the muscular Poe's arms dove beneath Link's own, quickly hoisting upwards and yanking him up in the air, his arms stretched out and too far from Beth for him to try and fight back. Something the lusty ghost was all too happy to exploit. She floated above the ground, the boy kicking and screaming in her grasp. Then, she kicked up her feet, just barely in view of the young hero as her toes sensually twiddled in front of him. From Beth's vantage point, she could see the adorable blush on Link's face and the bulge forming in his tunic. And so, her feet traveled underneath his tunic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squealed out as he felt her feet wrap around his dick, them tight around it like a hug. His body suddenly went stiff, like he feared one wrong move would get him in big trouble. However, despite how careful he kept himself still, he could feel her cruel smile bearing down on him. And then... they began stroking. He squirmed about with great intensity as she rubbed him, keeping her grip on his arms tight and the grip on his dick tighter as he rubbed up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~ I feel your heart beating between your legs~\" she cooed out as she stroked. \"It's beggin' for this, kid. You're beggin' for this. And lemme tell you, I'm a very generous person~\" She kept up her efforts, her feet kneading Link's dick with great fervor. Sometimes she went slow, gently rubbing up the shaft before her toes teased the tip. Sometimes she was fast, quickly rubbing up and down Link's length. By now, the boy felt too weak to scream... and felt a wetness at his tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, are you already close to strike one?\" she teased as she stroked. Link didn't know what she meant, but he refused to give her the satisfaction of accomplishment. He vigorously shook his head, even as his pre stained the soles of Beth's feet. \"Yes you are~\" she teased like she were talking to a puppy. She kept stroking and stroking, the young hero growing too flustered and too hot to struggle against her...</span></div></div>",

Then, she got close, and Link's nose wrinkled up in disgust. Sure enough, the enemy had this horrid stench about her, radiating as she approached the hapless hero. And it only grew as she slipped her arms under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, boy, up and at 'em!\" she said, tugging him up, unfortunately squeezing him close to her smelly body.

So, naturally, the young boy went towards the left door. He opened it up, and walked through it. After walking through, though, the door shut behind him, tightly. He would've tried to open it again, but the treasure chest in the middle of the room caught more of his attention. It was a distinguished brown while also having brilliant gold trimming about it. Obviously, the adventurer was drawn to it. So, he approached cautiously, glancing left and right to make sure that Poe wasn't anywhere waiting for him. He still didn't know which of these rooms this was, the smelly one, the safe one, or the surprise one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood before the chest and began to open it up, only for it to suddenly spring open. He was shocked by how the lid opened up, not even realizing that the hourglass figure suddenly coming out was that of Joelle's. Before he could recover from the shcok, the Poe dove her arms underneath Link's, hoisting him up in the air with a perverse grin on her face. She then slumped back into the chest, Link in tow, before shutting the chest down on the two of them. Now, Link was left in darkness, bately able to move... and forced to smell all of that horrid ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the smell!\" he heard the familiar Poe voice say. Then, he was thrown down onto the floor the chest, which was thankfully lined with red velvet. However, before he could get up, he felt the Poe's hourglass body slither over him, her torso covering his lower body... and her smelly rump on Link's face. Her red-robe-covered butt swallowed up his cheeks, and were rubbing side to side on top of him, keeping that smell strong and on his face. She stopped rubbing, though she kept him pinned. However, he could feel her grin down at him, despite his already dark-covered view being blocked by her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3...\" She slowly dragged her butt leftwards, scrubbing against his face like a sponge on some plate, painfully rubbing him and drawing out her words so it'd last as long as this grind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2...\" Again, she dragged out her word, making sure it lasted as long as her rightwards scrub, her cheeks dragging all over Link's. By the time she finishes, she picks up her butt a little bit, only to sit down, wedging Link's nose into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...1...\" Joelle pushed her butt downwards, her cheeks wrapping around Link's face and pulling his nose deeper and deeper into the abyss that is her smelly butt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone were outside the chest right now, they'd see it rattle and shake as a thunderous raspberry noise eruptted from it. If you listened really carefully, you could hear a boy's muffled squeal and hear him quick one of the walls of the chest in a panic. The chest stopped shaking, only for another raspberry noise to make it rumble again, followed by another squeal. Link managed to crawl out from under her, only to run into the leftside of the chest, followed by Joelle's massive rump slamming against it and pinning him down, causing the chest to shake to one side, getting knocked off center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother raspberry noise sounded out, and someone could swear the left panel of the chest shook from the force of the attacker. Joelle dragged her butt around, dragging Link towards the back panel and the front panel, rubbing in the horrid stench and pinning him against another side of the chest, letting out lighter attacks on the poor boy's nose. After a while, the lid was thrown open, a thick cloud of green stink billowing out. Link's hand grasped the upper rim, and he pulled himself up, gasping and heaving after the assault he'd been under. Unfortunately, his desire for fresh air was given more priority over the desire to escape, a costly choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Joelle's hand was around his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done with you yet, kid!\" she said as she began pulling him back. He screamed out, trying to grab the rim with all that he's worth. He tried to pull himself free of the horrible Poe, silently begging he never had to go through what she just did to him again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, she loved the thought of dominating him with more than her stench. She grinned, and she lifted her feet off of his face, leaving them on the boy's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is usually Beth's territory, buuuuuut\u2026\" she said in a teasing tone. And then, she began to lower her feet, dragging them across his torso, leaving behind slight sweat stains as they got lower and lower on his body... approaching the bottom of his tunic. Link looked on confused as her feet came down closer and closer to his legs, and he felt them shake in fear, anticipating some kind of horrifying punishment. And then, her feet dove under his clothing... and towards his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gasped once he felt her stinky feet wrap around his dick, the sweat making them feel slick on his poor, vulnerable body part. Joelle grinned at that reaction, seeming to've been hoping for that. Link thought maybe she made a mistake. After all, people weren't supposed to touch others <i>there</i>. But Joelle's grin told him a different story. And then, making sure her soles were nice and wrapped around his shaft, she began to rub up and down his dick, the boy squirming at her touch. And yet, he felt this weird feeling between his legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel you growing, kid,\" she teased as she kept rubbing. \"Growing, growing, growing, nicely fitting between my feet... It's like a sword sliding safely into its sheath. I'm starting to think you were practically born for these feet. You fit nicely~\" Link felt shame creep up at the poe's teasing. He didn't want to lose anything to the villain! And if he lost this fight... he had a feeling he'd lose something so precious, he could never get back. He tried to crawl away, hoping he could crawl out of the chest somehow...</span></div></div>",

He felt disgusted he'd let himself laud in her horrid stench. And then, they lifted. Though he sighed at the reprieve, he was too weak to stand. A weakness that Joelle was more than happy to exploit. He heard her snap her fingers, and with a pomf, something fell in her lap. Link looked up, and saw a sudden ball of laundry in her lap! It visibly emanating stink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.U.\" she said. \"I forgot how much these stunk! They must've been burning a hole in my previous chest! Good thing I've got a new one right here~\" Link's eyes widened at that last part. And then she lifted a stinky stocking, and dropped it into the chest Link was lying in. It fell upon his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to crawl away, but then a gown was dropped over his body. This was followed by a pair of panties falling on his face, the smell of sweat and methane causing the boy to thrash. It was at that point Joelle was through with teasing, and began dumping the whole of her sweaty clothes into the chest with Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the chest open, no light reached Link. He was just covered under layers of laundry. And stink pervaded every inch. The stink made his eyes water, that or the humiliation brought him to tears. Once she dumped the last of her stuff in, she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look lovely like that~\" she teased. \"But, I'm gonna have to make you disappear a little!\" With that, she shut the chest.

As far as he knew, the moment he opened any of those doors, he'd pounded by more of her foul stink. So he sat down and waited. And waited. And waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter long enough, he saw Joelle's head peek out from the wall and into the room curiously. When she saw him just sitting down, she grew furious. She zipped over in front of him, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you think you're doing?\" she asked sternly like a mother would. Link felt fear creep up, but pouted and stayed seated. \"What, you think you can get away with not playing my game? That was just a courtesy of me! If I wanted, I could make you all mine!\" Link shivered at that, and began to reach for his sword. But then, the poe hit it away. \"...You know what? You don't want to play my game? Fine. I'll just shove you into a different game.\" She then reached down and grabbed Link's shoulders. She then lifted him over the ground, him beginning to kick in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you could've avoided my smell if you played my game just right!

His struggles within the web bindings doubled as the other sisters floated away, leaving Meg alone as she approached the ensnared hero. The ghosts were soon gone, and the chubby ghost loomed over him like a spider looking down on their prey. She grinned and approached, gently clasping her hands around the hero's cheeks... before planting her lips over his face. Not just on his lips or his cheeks, a smooch from her covered up his whole face, causing the embarrassed hero to struggle even harder at the embarrassing kiss. He felt like he'd let himself get snatched up by some aunt, which only made her breasts rubbing against his chests awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pop, Meg's lips popped off of him, leaving him a few breaths of air. She giggled and still leaned on him, looking down at him mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, boy, couldn't help but snatch myself a taste~\" she cooed, licking her thick lips, causing the hero to shiver. \"Now, I could just snatch you up, bring you home, and let you be my toy and mine alone. You realize that what happens from here on out were a touch of mercy, right?\" Link felt like if he didn't nod, she might do something worse than kiss him when he didn't want it. So, he nodded in understanding. \"Good! Well, because we're so merciful, but because we still managed to catch you, we'd like to play a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently scooped her arms under the hero, and lifted him up out of it, before floating towards one of the tree's walls. The hero was held uncomfortably close to her breasts, causing him to wriggle a little bit. Eventually, she passed through the wall, the hero somehow phasing through as well. The hero saw he was in a dark room, the braziers unlit, a purple carpet on the floor, and a changing curtain in the middle of the room. She floated in close, and dropped the hero on the floor, causing him to grunt out as he landed butt-first on the floor. Meg, meanwhile, floated over to the changing curtain, and pulled it, leaving Link to see only her silhouette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we may be showing you mercy, but we still expect you to earn your freedom. So, first things first, because I find you a real tasty treat, I'll offer you a choice~\" As she spoke, Link stood up, wearily watching the curtain. And then, it went away, and the Poe was gone. Now, he was nervously scanning the room, holding the sword out wearily. Then, the braziers lit with a purple light, illuminating the room around him. It seemed featureless, though the room itself wasn't what he had to pay attention to. It was four Meg's now surrounding him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your first challenge, you can do one of two things. First, you could try and find the right Meg. Three of these are illusions.\" They approached, slowly, menacingly circling him. Link nervously scanned around the four of them. \"You have to find the right one, sweetheart. If you don't...~\" Next thing he knew, he was grabbed from behind. She lifted him up, wrapped her arms around him, and yanked him in, squishing his tiny face into her cleavage and wriggling left and right, snuggling the tiny hero into her cleavage. \"Then I'll squeeze that resistance out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing the hero knew, she let go, letting him fall butt-first onto the ground, now panting heavily to get some breath. \"Don't forget about the second choice~\" Link shuddered to think what else that Poe could be up to. Though, his attention was drawn to the shadow forming around his body. It grew and grew, and seemed kinda... heart-shaped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resounding slam, Meg's butt had completely squashed him, pinning him firmly to the ground and firmly wedging his face up in between her cheeks. She giggled and rubbed side to side. \"I could stick you on an obstacle course, force you to try to get to the exit. But if I catch you, I'll keep you stuck up there, drag you to the start of the course, and you to try to run again. If you can't reach the finish line in time, I'll make you my little snugglebug!\" She spread her cheeks, allowing Link the chance to get out, taking in deep breaths after that terrifying pin. Then, Meg floated in front of him, a smug look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What'll it be, hero?\"</span></div></div>",

Having grown up around a bunch of fellow kid-sized beings, he had no idea what these parts were. But the way he was smooshed against them made him feel... dirty? ...guilty? Something about her body made him feel funny, and the way she spoke didn't alleviate matters. And somehow it seemed that lady knew something weird was going on in Link's chest. Either way, Link decided he'd have an easier time running than choosing which isn't the illusion, so he requested the obstacle course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, didn't get enough of mama's booty, dear~\" she asked teasingly, before turning around and tauntingly shaking her rump at him. Being reminded of what she did earlier, Link looked away, blushing. Meg giggled before floating to him and cradling him. She floated through a wall, the boy in tow. As they traveled, Link felt his cheek smooshed up against one of her sizable breasts, being reminded how easily Meg's cleavage could swallow him up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she floated into the dreadful Forest Temple, or at least it seemed that way, specifically into a square room. It wasn't too long or wide, but the ceiling stretched high. A good thing too, considering the door out seemed to be way up at the top instead of on the level Link was set down. He was on the bottom floor, chess-like tiling lining it. Out at one corner, he saw another chess-like ramp leading upwards, pointed at a set of thin floors that seemed to be moving left and right. Looking past that, he saw a floor containing a puzzle he couldn't see from here. He saw another set of odd platforms leading to another floor, then another, then another. It seemed there were four floors to go up, a set of stairs in between each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you 30 minutes, kid,\" Meg said. \"If you reach the door on the uppermost floor, I'll hand you off to one of the others. If you don't, then you don't have to ask for games for the chance to feel my curves~\" Link blushed and darted his eyes away from the poe as she sensually ran her hands over her body. Soon, she leaned down and gently held his cheeks, making him look up at her. \"First, though, a good luck kiss!\" Her lips puckered, and once again the poor boy's face was thrust into their loving embrace, her sucking on his squirming face as she snuggled him. Soon, she let go, causing him to stumble back and fall on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time starts... now!\" With that, she faded from view. Link got up to his feet, and ran over to the ramp. He looked at the moving platforms. He kept looking and looking, trying to figure out the right time to jump on them... Unfortunately, he wasn't watching out. A heart-shaped shadow began encompassing him, and he didn't even notice the shadow. He kept watching and watching, and, like a wallmaster, Meg squashed the boy beneath her derriere, him forced to be face up while his body had disappeared beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot about this~\" she teased, rubbing her butt side to side over the boy. Link felt utterly humiliated and squirmed beneath her, his cheeks burning brightly. And yet, despite how humiliating her attack was... he felt his heart flutter at the butt around him... She clenched her cheeks, squeezing them around the boy and wedging him in between them. Then she floated up, and towards where she initially set Link down when he entered. Then, with a grunt and an unclench of her buttocks, Link was out, falling onto the floor underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"29:20... You really need to watch out for yourself more... unless you wanted me to catch you~?\" Before Link had a chance to protest, she vanished, and Link was left with the puzzle again. He felt this urge to cross his legs despite being alone, out of fear she could see him. He needed to complete this course, and yet... something about her butt... He briefly considered letting her catch him again.</span></div></div>",

And its hips would put its rump at wider than Link's face were he normal sized. In fact, he's certain he'd only be thigh-high next to it if he were at normal height. It also bore large, perky breasts, that'd easily put any normal man to bed quickly. And atop them was a lady head that seemed to display a warmth he'd expect to see in some caretaker. And from its head was a set of straight locks that draped down over the ground behind it. The figure before Link looked like a very detailed naked lady, showing off realistic orifices and curves. The only thing strange about her figure, besides the fact that she was made of green slime, were the eyes, which didn't bare any pupils. They didn't even look like Chuchu eyes. Its like the Chuchu molded its figure to look like it bore eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was stunned at the figure before him, and nervously crossed his legs as he look at it.

He looked more carefully at what he grabbed, and he realized he'd accidently grabbed the butt of a smaller version of the Chuchu!

Pleased with their work, the slimes stopped rubbing and grabbed his tunic. With no way to fight back and resist, Link only watched in horror as the removed his clothes forcefully, actually ripping them off with enough force to tear them up irreparably.

He wasn't sure whether he was tickling the now giggling Chuchu, or if she found his struggling funny. Either way, her laughter spurred him to keep pushing. As fun as watching the little guy struggle against her was, the Chuchu decided to spice up the game. Link suddenly felt the slime around him jiggle, and shift upwards. Two humanoid figures formed on either side of him, and they both looked like the Chuchu, except scaled down to his size. And, sure enough they still towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them flashed a grin at each other, as if exchanging some wordless joke between each other. One of the Chuchus plucked Elzo from his head, and he could only watch as it fluttered down towards the ground. He kept trying to strain against the slimy flesh of the Chuchu while the two watched. Then, he felt two warm hands on either cheek. An almost comforting hold. And the source was one of those ladies. She lifted his head towards her a little, leaned down, and smacked a kiss on his face. With a pop, she pulled her lips off of him, but he could still feel the slime on him. It's like she left some slimy lipstick on him. It felt weird, like he was burning up on the inside. A fact the lady seemed to exploit as she kept peppering him. After a few smacks, she began to lean towards his lips, and he subconsciously felt himself pucker up. However, the lady pulled away just before they could connect. She let out a knowing laugh, giving Link enough time to become ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lady walked around to his back, and the lady formerly behind him came out front, looking down on him. Then, she turned around, revealing her shapely rear. And then, Link was suddenly enveloped. The lady sat on his face! At this, he kicked harder and harder, trying his hardest to escape. This wasn't particularly harmful. It wasn't even painful! But it was one of his most humiliating moments, being a mere chair for this lady. With a giggle, the lady scrubbed her rump side to side on him, before getting up, and tauntingly smacking her butt at Link. The two then went towards either of Link's sides, who was dazed by the attack. The two looked at each other, as if having some wordless argument.</span></div></div>",

However, if they were going to get to the interesting stuff, it was time to put their prince to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing minichu put her hands on the back of Link's head, and the minichu shoving her butt on his face leaned forward a little, the kissing minichu pushing Link against her rear as she was put onto all fours, and Link was forced onto his face. The facesitting minichu licked her lips as she prepared one more assault. A few more tendrils of slime wrapped themselves around the back of Link's head, which only made him more scared. He didn't have a lot of energy left, though, so he could only weakly struggle against the bindings. Once Link was securely strapped to her rump, the facesitting minichu grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of rotten eggs pounded against his face before a thunderous noise rang past his ears, the buttocks rumbling all about him. Link kicked and kicked as the blast hit against him. Unfortunately, he wouldn't last long. Before long, his struggling stopped, and he was limp. He'd passed out against the minichu's rump. Seeing how he lost, both minichus couldn't contain their laughter anymore. Midna, meanwhile, chuckled to herself at the events going on. As humorous as Link's defeat here was, it went by a bit too fast. Maybe she'd have that Chuchu do more stuff to Link, and maybe she'd giver him a chance to escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's dreams were overcome with images of that slime lady standing over him.

He saw images of one of the MiniChus holding him tightly against their bodies, so tightly, in fact, that he partially sunk into her flesh. He was swallowed up all the way to his neck, the MiniChu's face hanging in front of him. He noticed her grin widen, telling him all about how much trouble he was in. Then, he felt several lips pressing up against his lower body. What made it worse was the he could feel the slime creeping under his clothes for easier access to his flesh. He felt multiple smooches assault his lower body, which made him squirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried his hardest to yank himself away from the MiniChu, but she held him tightly within herself. All the while, the MiniChu kept up her taunting gaze. Then, her face began leaning towards him. She began to close her eyes and pucker her lips as she approached. Link, meanwhile, kept leaning away from her, trying to escape. However, before her lips connected... he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in some weird, underground village. It didn't appear to be very big though. The \"houses\" appeared to be discarded pieces of cloth, cloths were set on the ground to represent markets, but there were several MiniChus walking around. They looked like those same ones that knocked him out while he was facing the big ChuChu. They all looked like identical pretty ladies. Link felt something weird on his face. He wiped, and removed a few, lip-shaped slime marks. Link groaned at the realization, and hopped up from where he was lying. He felt around himself, and realized a few bad things:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) He had no sword<br>\r\n2) He had no shield<br>\r\n3) His wallet was gone<br>\r\n4) Enzlo was missing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if being in the middle of this group of weird, powerful Chu people wasn't bad enough, he was completely unarmed! While he was realizing his predicament, he heard a giggling. He looked to his side, and saw one of those Chus had discovered he was awake. He immediately began running, but the Chu quickly scooped him up. He squirmed about in her grip, but she held him tightly, bringing her over to one of the carpets representing a market stand. He set him down in front of it, and showed off the Chus wares. He noticed four things: a sword, a shield, a wallet, and a hat-shaped creature. This Chu was showing him that all of his gear was on sale! 240 rupees for the sword, 180 rupees for the shield, 99 for the wallet, and 500 for the hat. He probably would've been able to buy some of them if he hadn't been robbed during his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't leave without this stuff, least of all his hat. Link looked down sadly, unable to pay for any of it. However, the Chu that picked him up leaned over his shoulder, and turned his face towards a few things in the den. One area had a \"Hide n Go Seek! Evade a Chu, win 30 rupees,\" sign. One area had a \"Survive a night with the chu! Stay awake all night, win 60 rupees,\" sign. And one area had a \"Seeking Milk! 45 rupees per bottle filled,\" sign. It seemed the Chu wanted Link to participate in some strange games so he can get the rupees for all your gear. Link saw a few stalls were being set up, so maybe they were building up other stalls for later. Maybe if you participated with any of them, Link'd get enough to get your gear back. Then again, if it's one of their games, it couldn't be good. Perhaps Link could sneak his gear away from them?</span></div></div>",

As detached as it was, it was still part of the chuchu and quite a useful tool for scam... err... beating newbies who had never played hide and seek with a chuchu before. And now, she was preforming her favorite trick to finish the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur young hero stilled as he heard the distinctive sound of wet footsteps moving closer to the mushroom. He made a futile attempt to calm his breathing and tried his best to stop shivering. While the chuchu\u2019s here didn\u2019t seem malevolent, he couldn\u2019t help but remember how easily he had been defeated <b>with</b> all of his equipment. What would he do unarmed? His breath quickened as the steps stopped just on the other side of the slimy fungus. He shivered, holding himself as he held his breath, trying to be as quiet as possible, not even realizing the game was already over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chuchu grinned as she touched the slime covering the mushroom, seamlessly and silently melding into it as she traveled up and over the mushroom, winding up directly behind the terrified little boy on the other side. She waited as he seemed to calm down at the lack of her footsteps, or any other sound for that matter. The child turned to check around the mushroom again as she made her move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had gathered enough courage at the lack of any sound from the chuchu. He took a deep breath and turned to peak around his cover, only to receive a face full of delighted, light blue chuchu as she burst from the slime covering the traitorous fungus. Slimy, yet firm arms wrapped around his own, pinning them to his sides as the jump pushed them both to the ground. To his horror, he found out that the chuchu had copied more than just his childhood friend\u2019s face, as a watery echo of her giggles emitted from the lookalike. He closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, the chuchu got off him and held her had out to help him out. Remembering that they were just playing a game, he let out a sigh of relief as he accepted her help and they both walked towards the cave entrance. Once outside, the chuchu led him to a set of small mushrooms undoubtedly used as chairs. Sitting down, he sighed as realized that he wasn\u2019t getting any rupees from this game, if the speed at which he was discovered was any indication. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up as he realized the chuchu was trying to get his attention by tapping his shoulder.

She giggled, just barely stopping herself from full on laughter as she realized that he <b>wanted</b> to be found! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying along, she stepped around a little, teasing him as she checked around a rock, in some grass and even another set of completely unrelated mushrooms grouped together. She could see him through the slime sense, the small boy shivering as he held his arms together. He was clearly eyeing the slime on the mushroom, having figured out that it clearly had something to do with how she found him. She had to hold back her laughter as her playmate rubbed himself against the slime, wether to warm himself up or to help her find him faster, she wasn\u2019t sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to end the poor boy\u2019s misery, she started walking fast towards the mushroom, keeping her attention on him at all times.

Being so close, she could clearly hear him rubbing against the slime, as well as his panting from his efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to reward those efforts by traveling through the slime once more, enveloping him from behind. She giggled as he sighed, relaxing into her embrace, the polar opposite of his reaction the previous time he\u2019d been caught. Pulling herself out of the mushroom while still holding onto him, she turned him around and gave him a kiss, a slimy tongue slipping into his mouth. The little boy\u2019s eyes widened,  then to her slight surprise, closed in contentment as she continued the kiss. Moans echoed through the cave from both of them as she continued the deep kiss. She reached down with her left hand, grabbing his small, firm butt, softly grasping and fondling his right butt cheek. Her right hand softly grasped the back of his head, keeping him in place as she claimed his mouth with her artificial tongue, swirling it around his mouth as she drank in his saliva, absorbing it into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she released him, earning a slight moan of discomfort as her warm body left his, re-exposing him to the cool air. She giggled at the dazed look on his face as she grabbed his hand and led him back to the entrance. He seemed to shake out of it as they exited and she led him to the mushroom chairs again. A look of horror went through his eyes as he no doubt realized the consequences of being caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both turned to see a green chuchu taking the box of his offered clothes and replacing it with another box, placing the offering sign on it. She turned and giggled at the sight of her naked playmate as she took the box of clothes into the market area, quickly going out of sight amidst the crowd of other chuchu girls of various colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to her favorite playmate, she gestured towards the sign again, wanting to play more! She was confused as he looked depressd, shaking his head. Oh right, he didn\u2019t have anything left. Thinking to herself, she suddenly came up with a great idea! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could get up and leave, she got the boy\u2019s attention again, pointing at the sign, and then poking him on the chest. He seemed confused at that so she pointed towards him once more, than to herself. Eyes widening once more, the boy blushed as he finally realized what she had been asking him, simply offer himself as a prize and he could \u201cplay\u201d again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer playmate closed his eyes and folded his arms, contemplating her offer.</span></div></div>",

Rather than a giggle as usual, the chuchu simply gave him a warm smile that caused his face to heat up, his heart pacing as an unknown feeling spread through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back towards the cave as his playmate closed her eyes again. Knowing exactly what he was doing, Link went back behind the same exact mushroom for the 3rd time, embracing the slime as he waited to be found again. He wanted to feel her embrace again, her warmth that protected him from the cold air of the cave. Something about the chuchu wearing the face of his friend made him want to press their lips together again, and again and again. He reached down as his crotch felt weird. Trying to satisfy the feeling, he gripped his penis hoping to make the feeling go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back in after him, the chuchu wasted no time, immediately walking towards the same slimy mushroom again. She didn\u2019t need to use the slime sense, as he was making plenty of noise, but decided to anyway.

His head was quickly filled with a nice haze again as her tongue explored his mouth and filled him with warm feelings, reaching all the way to his crotch, intensifying the feeling from before a hundred fold. Like last time, the chuchu took her left hand and once more grabbed him by the butt, filling him with more nice sensations. To his surprise though, she lifted him up, turning his body sideways to lay in her arms, (bridal carry) while still kissing him. He gave in to the warm feelings as she turned and started walking towards the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sooo happy! She was going to be able to keep her playmate all to herself! He was trying to deepen the kiss even now, attempting to push against her tongue with his own. She smiled inwardly, as she shut down his attempt with casual ease, tying up his tongue with hers and continuing her unopposed domination of his mouth. Walking out of the cave, she walked to a stump opposite to the mushroom and chairs and finally released the kiss, her little playmate gasping as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An odd feeling going through her body as she stood on the stump, she spun and lifted her brand new possession above her head in her right hand. She could swear she heard a little musical jingle coming from somewhere as he oddly floated just above her hand for a few seconds before returning to the bridal carry. She smiled as she looked down at her unconscious prize, the young boy now belonged to her. They would get to be playmates forever and ever! She gave his butt cheeks another quick grab, causing a small shiver to pass through his body and a moan to escape his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away from the attraction, she went into the market area, proudly showing off her prize, much to the surprise, joy and envy of all the other chuchu girls. She passed by the prize booth, the clerk there recognizing her and quickly realizing she was holding her newest prize from her game. Heading into her cloth tent for a moment, she returned with a pink slime collar. The ZeldaChu held up her sleeping prize as she let the clerkchu place the collar around the boy\u2019s head, eventually fitting around his neck. Dipping her finger into the collar, it changed to her own light blue color, and shrunk, fitting nicely around his neck and leaving a mark of the same color on his neck underneath the collar, marking him as hers. The clerkchu pulled the collar off and handed her prize back to the Zeldachu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking him up in a bridal carry once more, she left the market area, heading for her own little cloth tent. She couldn\u2019t wait to <b>truly</b> snuggle with him once he woke up!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link wakes, slightly groggy as he remembers what happened. His loss 3 times over at the hands of the Zeldachu cost him everything, his possessions, his chances at rescuing Zelda, and even himself. He was surprised that he didn\u2019t feel all that bad about it. Rather, his thoughts were filled with nothing but the light blue chuchu that his friend resembled sooo much. Wait, wasn\u2019t it the other way around? As he was pondering this, a familiar giggle sounded off next to him. Turning, he realized he was sitting on a wooden bed, with a large leaf as the cover and small slime balls as what appeared to be pillows. A glowing mushroom in the corner of the room lit up the tent with a soft orange glow. All of this was completed by the Zeldachu that he had surrendered himself to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to think for a moment, and the got off the bed and turned to face him. Before his eyes, the \u201cclothes\u201d the Zeldachu was eating melded into her body, revealing the now naked form of his best friend, something Link never realized until now that he wanted to see. The warmth immediately returning to his crotch once more as he drank in the slimy replica of Zelda\u2019s naked body, complete with small breasts and a cute, round butt. She giggled once more, holding her hands above her head and moving and twisting her body, letting him see every inch of the Zeldachu\u2019s \u201cnaked\u201d body, his whole body turning red as he took in all of her curves and smooth \u201cskin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zeldachu smiled as she watched her prize eagerly drink in her naked form. Was it really that appealing to him? She didn\u2019t quite understand humans, let alone small ones that just gave themselves up to chuchu\u2019s. But she loved his gaze all the same, knowing she had him right where she wanted him. All that was left was to invite him in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprises weren\u2019t done for Link, as he watched her body \u201copen\u201d for a lack of a better term. A seam appeared down from where her collar bone would be, down to her crotch as she split open, the front of her torso opening like a pair of doors, leaving a hollow area inside. One just wide enough for home to step into, he realized. Gulping, he looked to her face, getting a nod of confirmation in the process. Face still red, he stepped towards his new owner, turning as he reaches her. He stuck his legs in first, fitting perfectly into her own. Next, he slipped his arms in as he backed towards her body, the inside of her back pressing against the outside of his own. Finally, her head lifted up and widened slightly. Link allowed her head to envelope his as he finished giving himself to his new owner, the body of his best friend closing around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, you could barely see Link as the Zeldachu fit around him, her body pouring into every open oriface as she intergrated herself into his body. Link moaned loudly as he felt his master entering deep inside him, his body held up by her own. The amazing feeling in his little penis reaching the climax at last, as little white puffs were shot into Zeldachu\u2019s body, the slime around his croutch pumping his penis and fondaling his balls as she squeezed every last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to link, as Zeldachu filled his body, she overtook his nervous system, taking complete control of his body. Eventually, she took over his brain and thoughts entirely. A giggle emanating from both of their mouths as Zeldachu took complete control of her new body. The body of Zeldachu finished seeping into the body of link, leaving no trace of the light blue chuchu behind. Slowly, his body began changing, small breasts popping out from his chest as his whole body began slimming down slightly. Next his hair flattened out and extended, reaching down to the middle of his back. His butt lost it\u2019s firmness becoming more smooth and round. Finally, his penis and balls retracted into his crotch, receding into a hole that expanded inwards, completing the transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggles echoed through the house, turning into full on joyous laughter as Zeldachu inspected her new body, solid hands rubbing across every surface. A static shock of estacy rushed through her as her new nervous system kicked in, intensifying the feeling. She giggled more as she could hear the moans of her body\u2019s previous owner in her head, having given himself to her entirely and being locked away inside her consciousness. She concentrated and her body turned back to it\u2019s normal light blue chuchu self. Another mental flex and she was human again. Ohh yes, she could get used to this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test her new features, she sat back on the bed as she grabbed and fondled her new solid breasts and ass, trying her best to get as much feeling as possible as quickly as possible. Reaching down, she began fingering herself. An explosion of feeling rocked her new body as she spasmed and whites out, cumming for the first time in her body. Left gasping on the bed, she giggled some more, as she couldn\u2019t help but hear the loud orgasm of the little boy in her head as well. \u201cYep\u201d she decided, \u201cthis is the best prize I\u2019ve ever won!\u201d She exclaimed. The future looked bright for Zeldachu and her new body!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The 'Seeking Milk' sign immediately caught Link's attention. What could possibly be milked here? And what kind of milk did these Chu-Chus even need? Were there cows down here? With his curiosity piqued, he headed towards the stall to find out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chu-Chu manning the milking station glanced over at him, then jumped up, expression brightening. She waved him over, and held up a small, bizarrely-shaped glass. It was see-through, and had a long, cylindrical opening with a slightly wider spherical bottom. Judging from its size, it wouldn't take much milking to fill it up; Link would know, having helped Malon with her farm work in the past. The question of <i>what</i> he was supposed to milk, however, still wasn't answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Chu-Chu grabbed Link and yanked him over the counter. He let out a yelp of surprise, and tumbled down onto the knees, head nearly smacking against the floor. He stood still; the unexpected landing knocked him out of breath. His assailant closed the blinds, and put up a propped sign that read 'IN USE' in large, red letters. She was giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Link was about to give the Chu-Chu a piece of his mind, she grabbed the hem of his pants and pulled down, leaving them around his ankles. He immediately tried to pull them up again, but the sticky residue from her hands was strong enough to leave them stuck were they were. This was bad. How could he get away from this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter subduing her 'assistant', the stationed Chu-Chu picked up the flask again. She brought it to her mouth and...licked the sides of it? Leaving a bit of slime on the sides. Weird. She also put her hand up to her lips. A strange, suction-cup noise preceded a loud pop. She had somehow produced a pair of green, translucent lips, which she quickly fashioned onto the flask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned back to Link, a lewd grin apparent on her face. He had obviously made no headway in freeing himself from his trousers. He cringed, not liking the implications of that slime-bottle one bit. She smacked her lips at him, causing a few droplets of slime to spatter against his face. A pit grew in his stomach. <i>Oh no, not again...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chu lunged at him, flask in hand, and smashed her mouth against his. Gooey lips ground against Link's own, and a soft tongue probed them. He tried in vain to push her off of his prostrate form, only succeeding in getting his arms stuck in an embarrassing pose, laid along the Chu-Chu's plush rump. A hum of approval rumbled against his lips, the slimy seductress clearly pleased by his playing along. Slowly, her free hand oozed through the waist of his undergarments, cool fluid easing across his skin. A hot rush shot up through Link's veins as the wandering appendage gripped his member. She gave it a few gentle tugs, making sure it was ready. He blushed, and wriggled furiously under the Chu-Chu as an erection sprouted in her grip, already twitching. With a gulp, Link realized <i>exactly</i> what kind of 'milk' the slime was after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the enthusiasm of Link's second head, the Chu-Chu pulled the hero's cock out into the open, a gentle breeze further stimulating the now erect organ. She kept it pointed straight forward, and moved the bottle towards Link's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips on the opening of the bottle parted slightly, allowing his glans to fit snugly inside as the rest of the shaft was pushed into the bottle, eventually reaching the base. Despite his misgivings, Link let out a low moan at the unusual feeling of constriction on his member. The excellent lubrication that the Chu-Chu's spit provided made the walls of the glass feel almost...pleasurable. Not to mention the soft, firm lips that now rested at the base of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe milked him, slowly and steadily, the glass rhythmically pumping against his delicate skin. The complex stimulation of both the long, tight tunnel of the bottle and the malleable lips that squeezed and sucked at his shaft melted Link's mind. A slave to his overwhelming physical urges, he moved his hips in unison with the coaxing motion of the Chu-Chu's grip. He parted his own lips, allowing the smothering smooch that his captor forced upon him to deepen. He let her slimy tongue meet with his own, and they performed a long, passionate dance, only stopping to ensure that he didn't pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the sensory overload from all these new, intense sensations pushed Link over the edge; with a final push against the Chu-Chu's hand, he came, long ropes of jism splashing against the bottom of the flask. A few last strokes and suckles squeezed the last drops of the orgasm from his cock. The bottle was filled. The Chu-Chu ended her and Link's kiss with a loud pop, leaving green residue all over his lips, and a tingling sensation in his mouth. She quickly stuck a finger into the flask, sucking up all of the slime she layered the opening with, leaving the semen untouched. She produced a cork from her slime, and sealed her new product tightly, ready for sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the afterglow died down, Link felt extremely embarrassed for himself. He felt like he just lost an important milestone that he'd never get back. Even then, he couldn't deny the mind-blowing pleasure of what he just experienced. Fatigue and reluctant contentment lidded his eyes, and he quickly felt his consciousness fading. The last thing he saw was the complacent grin of the Chu-Chu that had expanded his world, for better or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Link woke up, he was...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly hit with clarity, Link held his sword and shield up defensively, deciding not to go down without a fight! The Chuchu's hands got closer and closer to Link, before she daintily lifted one hand, and tried to pinch her fingers around him, but he rolled away. The fingers were inches behind him, and he spun around to try and slice at it. However, he felt his blade get stuck in the finger, as if he were trying to cut thick jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the hero's horror, he felt his body get lifted up as the Chuchu lifted her hand, the sword still in place. However, Link pulled away, freeing himself and falling on the ground. Link got up to his feet, rubbing the back of his head, a little disoriented. He then turned towards the Chuchu, suddenly shocked as he saw the creature's massive lips descend towards him. Faster than he could respond, her lips enveloped his face, and she gave him a powerful kiss. The suction of her lips held Link close against her lips, to the point where she could lift her head and pull Link with her. She could easily swallow him up, but she wanted to play. So, she stopped her suction, and let Link fall onto the ground, though now a green, slimy stain covered his face, like a lipstick mark. While he was disoriented, the Chuchu giggled at the mark on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tried wiping the sticky moisture on his face, but all he found was that any attempt at cleaning the mark only got his sleeves stuck to his face for a little. Link groaned, feeling humiliated. By now, she was just toying with him. She could've easily eaten him right there and then. Link steeled himself, and got ready for a fight...</span></div></div>",

Link was confused to what she was doing now. All he heard was a suction noise coming from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in one swift motion, she pulled her hand away, releasing a projectile of green slime at the hero, shaped like a pair of lips. Link raised his shield in an attempt to block it, only for it to be knocked out of his hand as the slime hit its mark. Link was knocked on his back. Any attempt to move did nothing. The slime had made him stuck to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Link was so busy trying to get free, he didn't notice that the Chuchu lady had closed the distance. She was now hovering over the poor boy's trapped body, giggling in excitement. Link watched in horror as she closed her eyes and slowly closed in on him, making smooching noises the whole way. Then, she hit her mark, her lips pressed right against his face, leaving him to feel every slimy crevasse of her lips. She pulled away, leaving Link with even more slime trapping him. This caused her to laugh even more as his attempts to struggle free got weaker. She then went in again and again, each time kissing the trapped hero in a different spot, covering him in more slime and making it even harder for him to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, most of Link's body was entrapped in the slime. The most he could do now was slightly crane his neck. The chuchu girl had just finished one last kiss on his crotch. She saw that the hero now couldn't move at all. Deciding to move on, she stuck out her tongue and proceeded to cover the hero in one massive lick, from his feet to his head, covering him in one last coat of slime. With that, Link lost what little movement he had left as he was now entirely at the slime woman's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do to him?</span></div></div>",

Midna gave a smile as she watched the hero struggle. The Chuchu raised up, still containing the tiny Hylian in her rump. As Link struggled, he was really worried what she was planning. Suddenly, the Chuchu started to push her butt cheeks together, making things tighter. Not only did the place smell like a dumpster to Link, but now he was running out of air quickly. The Chuchu pressed together, not using all of her strength, but enough to make things difficult for him. She shook it a little and giggled.

Link spied that the paw was fox-like, and attached to a pair of leather pants, reminding him of a certain enemy. Another fox leg came down, before it got down on its hands and knees, and entered the room. The hero didn't even have to see the monster's face to recognize that a Keaton was coming down to face him. He was both horrified and confused. How could this guy fit in here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have much time to consider that question, for the fox was reaching for the tiny hero.

Link kept swinging his sword, doing the best he could to bring down this fox. He was doing damage to it, but it wasn't much. As the shrunken hero fought, the Keaton decided he was hungry and started to suck air in, along with the hero. Link tried to stand his ground, but was quickly pulled into the dark slimy cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, becoming a treat! I wonder how he'll get out of this one, if he does.\"  Midna said curiously. She concentrated and had an internal investigation. The Keaton was toying with Link, tossing him around, getting a taste of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is great, I can't believe we're going to be devoured!\" Ezlo complained. Link started to think quickly as the furry creature tilted its head back, about to swallow the hero. Link started to go down, but didn't fight it, making Midna more curious. Once Link was in the throat, he struggled and pulled out his sword, getting it stuck. The Keaton suddenly put his paws to his throat, panicking. It started to cough, stopping Link's progress to the stomach. Link the struggled to reach his new gust jar, hoping to blow air in the throat, hurting the Keaton even more. That wasn't necessary though as the monster collapsed of exhaustion, disappearing and releasing the tiny hero and his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know. Link was actually able to defeat it.\" Though Link couldn't see it, Midna started to clap slowly for him. She then snapped her fingers and summoned her two wolves. \"My friends, I want you to go to the Minish portal. Link will try to become big again, but I want that delayed. If he tries to get past you and use it, feel free to scare or even taste him.\" Midna said and teleported away. April and May quickly rushed over to a portal. May went to the first one Link found, and April went to the new one Link was headed for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Midna, she went to Hyrule town to have a little fun. She looked around until she saw the Hurdy-Gurdy man giving out kinstones. She sent a magic wave targeting the kinstones he had, and any in the world, and changed their effect to something more unusual. Midna then saw Anju and her house and gave a big smile. She knew that the baby chicks would go after Link, but it was a little disappointing to her that they didn't do much. Midna concentrated and made the chicks stronger and hungrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now if any Cucco sees tiny Link, they will want to eat him. If cuccos see big Link, they will try to sit on him. Oh, and I can't forget the change I made earlier.\" She said, referring to the fact that everybody will now be aware of shrunken Link, and be more crueler to him. Midna leaned against a wall and looked to see how her challenger was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was still shrunken down, trying to get to the portal. April growled at him, making sure he didn't take one step closer. Midna could tell that her wolf friend wanted Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, you may taste him. Just be careful and don't eat him.\" Midna said. April jumped toward Link, landing on him and catching him off guard. The female wolf licked Link slowly, he tasted good. After a minute of covering Link in saliva, the wolf ran away, heading to May. Link slowly got up and used the portal. After a while, he got to Hyrule town and\u2026</span></div></div>",

She listened in on the monster, taking a quick peek into his thoughts to see just what it was planning. Many many thoughts on ways to humiliate his new plaything flashed before her causing the princess to grin. But perhaps she could help it out a little. After all, Moblins weren\u2019t known for their thinking. A little nudge would probably be appreciated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moblin stared down at his prey, a strange voice seemed to echo in his mind. It wasn\u2019t familiar to him, but he definitely liked what it was suggesting. \u201cMake him submit. Put him in a position where he\u2019ll beg you to let him serve you.\u201d Link did not like the grin that was forming. Standing back to his full height, the moblin once again looked like a god. A dirty and smelly one, but all powerful nonetheless. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, toy.\u201d The moblin stressed that last word to drive in Link\u2019s helplessness. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a chance to make this more pleasant for the both of us. If you get on your knees and kiss the toe of my boot, willingly offering yourself to me as a pet or servant I\u2019ll go easier on you. Heck I\u2019ll even give you better food and better shelter.\u201d He grinned down at Link awaiting an answer. He didn\u2019t expect him to accept the first deal. In fact he was counting on Link refusing. That\u2019s when the fun will really begin. As expected. Link was not on board with this plan. He backed up slightly, feeling his back hit a tree. The moblin smirked as Link realized he was trapped, but the little hero wasn\u2019t quitting. Drawing his sword and shield, the hero stood his ground. This action was met with thunderous laughter. \u201cAww how cute. The toy wants to try to fight.\u201d With one powerful stomp next to the tiny toy, the hero was knocked on his ass from the shockwaves.he tried to get back up but the same foot kicked him, knocking him back against the tree. In reality, the moblin barely tapped him, but it was enough to get the point across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blow caused link to drop his weapon. The moblin noticed this and stepped back, giving Link a clear view of his blade. \u201cGo on... get it.\u201d He taunted as he leaned in over him. Link was terrified. This was utterly hopeless. He didn\u2019t have any weapons and the monster was barely even toying with him. But he couldn\u2019t give up. Not now. Definitely not like this. He had to fight on! With a loud yell, the young hero made a mad dash for his weapon. Suddenly a large shadow went over him as a laugh echoed above. He only saw of for a fraction of a second, but he knew what it was immediately when he glanced up. The moblin was lowering his ass on top of the tiny hero, preparing to sit down. Link tried to sprint faster but it was no use. The creatures ass was upon him. The smell was absolutely horrid. Everything was pitch black, and the unwashed cloth that separated Link from the monster\u2019s buttflesh was covered in dirt, sweat and grime. He made a few weak attempts to squirm, but it was no use. He was stuck. \u201cHmmm you\u2019re pretty comfy down there, toy. Maybe I\u2019ll stay like this for a while.\u201d He shifted slightly to pick up the tiny sword. Chuckling at the pathetic weapon before tossing it deep into the woods. Midna was giggling beneath the shadows at the show. Perhaps this brute is more cunning than she gave him credit for. <br>\r\n\u201cThe deals still out there if you want. Of course now you have to kiss my nice, big rear instead when begging for the chance to be my pet and slave.\u201d Link was completely disgusted. He almost wanted to cry. But he can\u2019t give in.</span></div></div>",

Even after grinding his rear against his tiny prey, he still couldn't get a kiss out of him. He initially seemed annoyed with this stubbornness, but of course he knew this only meant that there were loooooot of more fun things to do to try to break him. Perhaps he'll even withdraw the offer for a while after Link is finally in the mood to submit himself; an added punishment for not obeying his new god sooner. But for now he needed a new game to play with his toy. Something to wear him down. Then a sinister idea came to mind. Getting off the hero he looked down at Link. His clothes were drenched with hsi sweat and coated in dirt and grime. His body looked like it was battered and bruised, but still in one piece. 'Good. The toy is durable.' he thought as he reached down for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was blinded by the sudden sunlight. He tried to savor the fresh air, but the massive pig man's hand quickly grabbed him and lifted him up to his face. \"I got a special surprise for you. A new friend or two for you to meet.\" Link shuddered at the thought of being around more of them. Just one was bad enough, but being at the mercy of several. The moblin chuckled as he saw his toy shaking in fear. He set out, tucking Link into a pouch around his waist. Close enough that the feeling and smells were still near to him. Assaulting his senses with a cruel onslaught. Outside, the moblin neared a cave with various sets of bones outside. He finally reached his destination and went inside to find.</span></div></div>",

His voice sounded like that of a cruel god, taking delight in the torment of one of his subjects. Speaking of which, the Twilight Goddess herself remains on their trail, remaining a formless shadow on the ground as she watched the pig creature taking the diminutive hero to a new destination. She saw what was inside and smirked at the fun that was about to unfold. Back in the pouch, Link sat in fearful anticipation as he tried to feel around for some means to escape. Sadly, without a weapon or any gear at all he had nothing. The walls were too thick, and the area was shaking too much for him to climb. He was stuck. As if to add insult to injury, a thunderous sound echoed all around him as a foul wind started to choke him. Apparently the pouch was hanging in front of the moblin's ass and the creature let out a rather potent fart. Link choked and gagged desperately trying to find any source of fresh air at all, but there was none. He could only lay there dizzy and barely conscious while the gas assaulted his sense of smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the top of his prison opened up and a massive hand reached in. Even if he could move, Link stayed put and allowed it to grab him, knowing this was the only way he was ever getting out. The sweaty, meaty hand grabbed him tightly, and pulled the tiny hero out putting him face to face with his owner and 3 other Moblins. All of them towering over the hero with smirks on their faces that made his skin crawl. One of them, a really fat one, started to salavate at the sight of the tiny Hylian. Another who was absurdly muscular had a lustful look in his eye. The other seemed average build for a mob and gave Link a weirdly playful look, not that that made him any less terrifying. \"Boys. I present to you, our new plaything.\" Link's 'owner' bellowed to everyone present. \"Any suggestions for what we can do with him to break him in. Maybe a game where the winner gets to keep him?\" All three of the others grinned at this as they conversed among themselves about what kind of game they could play with their new toy. As this occurred, Link could swear he heard a feminine giggle echoing throughout the cave, yet none of the others seemed to notice or react to it. <br>\r\nFinally the game was decided.</span></div></div>",

Finally he was carelessly dropped onto the hard ground of the cave. Link winced in pain at the landing, but soon had much bigger problems. Seeing all 4 pig beasts standing over him with frightening grins, the muscular one spoke up. \"You're in luck, short stuff. We've decided to let you decide who will be the winner and loser of out game. Suddenly the fat one approached Link standing over him trying his best to look imposing to the diminutive hylian. \"W-what am I supposed to do?\" Link finally spoke up, knowing he wasn't escaping the 4 of them now. He was trapped. Fat one grinned. \"Just tell us who was the best and who was the worst. You'll be the prize so think carefully. Before he could question what the hell he was judging, the fat one kicked him under the muscular one just in time to see his cloth clad ass dropping on top of him. He tried to craw away but the moblin was having none of that. With the force of a mountain, Link was crushed almost instantly... or he would have if a certain, less than benevolent goddess who was watching the show didn't intervene to keep him alive from the impact. This of course was not a mercy as the beast grinded from left to right, roughing up the hero and covering his already filthy tunic in a whole new layer of sweat. As to be expected, the smell was awful. The moblin then lifted off link, making the battered hero sigh in relief. This was obviously not meant to last as the brutish creature quickly slammed his butt back down painfully causing him to scream. The pain surged all through his body. By some twisted miracle, his body would not break and he would not die. But this didn't stop the pain as the creatures rear kept slamming down harder and harder, pummeling him closer and closer to unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the brute was done with the hero. Getting off of him and giving him a chance to breathe. After all, he needed to be conscious for the nest competitor to take their turn. The next one up was the very fat one. Just as Link felt the feeling returning to his body, he saw a truly horrifying sight. This disgusting creature had removed all of his clothes and armor, revealing his huge, filthy and greasy form to all. As he looked down at his toy his exposed junk started to swell. Link immediately tried tried to crawl away as he saw this, but this escape got him maybe an inch before one of the other moblins snatched him up. With a sadistic grin, the monster removed links filthy clothes leaving him exposed to the cold and the prying eyes of his tormentors. Dropping him back on the ground, his original captor spoke to the other one. \"He's all yours, Nolg.\" The fat one smirked and lowered his bare ass down on the hero at a tauntingly slow pace. Link tried to crawl away, but a boot kicked him back under Nolg's gigantic rear. Link could only stare up in horror as the putrid flesh drew closer and closer until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic beast sighed happily as his ass was finally planted firmly on the floor. The tiny naked hero's struggles below tickled him. Back underneath, Nolg's rear was a complete and utter hell for Link. The stench was overwealming, and the flesh seemed to constantly shift and rub the heroes body all over, even grinding against his own privates giving him a VERY unwanted reaction. But the worst was still yet to come. After about a minute, Link heard a gurgling noise up above. Knowing exactly what was to come, the tiny hero thrashed about trying everything in his power to escape. But of course it was no use. The tickles only managed to amuse Nolg even more before he finally let it loose. Link was assaulted by a deafening thunder as the gross monster released the single biggest fart of its life. The blast of hot air hit link like a ton of bricks, pressing him hard against the floor while more and more hot gas escaped Nolg's bowels. Then the stench started to hit, this gas assaulted all of the hero's senses at once with extreme heat and a stench of rotting cheese. Link's struggles started to fade as the energy was sapped from his being. He could only lay there helplessly as the gas marked him. When if was finally finished the fat creature got off of the hero and looked down. \"Heh, i can still smell it on him. Lets see who wins now.\" He said with a smirk. All 3 of the others were laughing hysterically at Link's torment. The hero couldn't move or react to anything, he just laid there shaking a little as if he was still being assaulted by Nolg's gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright squirt,\" the first one said. \"It's time for you to pick the winner.\" Link was barely functioning at first but even with his limited grasp of reality at the moment he knew full well that Nolg or whatever the fat one's name was was WAAAAYYYYYY worse than the first one. Of course since he was going to be the prize, he sure as hell didn't want to willingly submit himself to more of Nolg's games. The look the fat monster was giving him now was terrifying enough. As he slowly regained his composure. Link announced his decision. \"H-he is the winner.\" Link said weakly pointing to the muscular one. Both of the competitors seemed to be grinning which didn't sit too well for the hero.</span></div></div>",

Whatever the Moblin wanted, Link was sure he'd be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular Moblin scooped Link up, and began walking deeper into the cave. Deeper within, there was a crudely made room, which must've belonged to the Moblin, because he opened the \"door,\" and took Link behind it. He dumped Link onto a bed, and stared down at him threateningly. To Link's horror, the monster placed his hands on his pants, and pulled them down. And thus, Link was exposed to the Moblin's giant muscle (even for a Moblin's size), and muscular thighs and legs. Link feared what was in store for him.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the moblin released Link, waiting to see if he would hold on to avoid falling.

She struts over to her downed Link, still dazed from her last attack. She kicked away his sword, shield and bow, before kneeling down in front of the hero. At this point, he had gotten off his back into a sitting up position, trying to move for his discarded gear. Midna clapped her hands on his cheeks, puckering his lips and snapping his attention back to her. She looked at him like a wolfos that had cornered her prey. Without a word or even breaking eye contact, she dove in for the kill, claiming the hero's lips for herself. Link was stunned by her forwardness. So stunned, that by the time he had noticed her snaking her tongue into his mouth, it was too late to stop her. She deepened the kiss and began to make it more audible for those around her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Links and Midnas all stopped their fights and turned to see what had happened. The Midnas began to laugh as they whistled and cat called at the display, only further humiliating green. The other Links blushed and looked away in shame at how powerless their duplicate was to resist her. The Midnas seized this opportunity to strike while their guards were down, each disarming and subduing their respective Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Midna had her Link on his back, arms and legs pinned by the goddess on top of him. He thrashed and struggled to try and break free. This made Red giggle at the willful resistance he put up, and how fun it will be to break it. She went straight for the throat as she swiftly sealed her mouth over his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue Midna had another approach. Sitting on Blue Link's chest, she was already making it hard for him to breathe, but then, using her magic, she grew her chest out to a modest E cup. The boy was already blushing at the sight of her massive chest, but it only got worse when she wrapped her arms around his head and pulled him into her cleavage, blocking both his mouth and nose and making it impossible to breath. She then began smooching his forehead, only deepening his shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlikable her sisters, Purple Midna didn't bother forcing her Link to the ground. Instead, she scooped Purple Link up in her arms and cradled him like a baby, binding his arms and legs together with magic. Taking a page from Blue, she magically enlarged her breasts to C cups. From Purple Link's perspective, she looked like a goddess of fertility. She then sealed his nostrils with magic before bring him up to her nipple and enchanting his mouth to make him suckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Midnas kept this up for as long as they wanted. Eventually, Blue Link passed out from lack of oxygen. Soon the other three joined him. The four Midnas rose, smirking at their work, before deciding on their next plan.</span></div></div>",

More of her smooching him, more of her smothering him in her breasts, and... \"Wake up!\" he heard again. This time, the voice was accompanied by the banging of iron bars. At that, with a groan, he stirred awake, rubbing his forehead. The other copies of him stirred awake, apparently having had similar dreams. They got to their feet, and looked around, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were stuck in some brick-room, covered in symbols akin to what those Midna creatures bore. They noticed a set of iron bars locking them into a relatively tight realm, like some kind of cell. Beyond the cell, the Links noticed a strange creature. She had black and white skin, and glowing markings like the green Midna, except she was much shorter than those ones, albeit still slightly taller than the Links. They also noticed her having wider hips. If they saw creatures like her before, they would've easily identified her as some kind of imp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're back,\" the imp said. \"Now, unfortunately, you have failed your test. So, my superiors, the ladies that tested you, have appointed me to getting you into fighting shape, or whatever do whatever I feel like doing to you. As fun as bullying you boys some more is, I'd hate to disappoint them.\" She spoke like she was a minion to the Midnas, but what the Links didn't know was that she was, in fact, the Green Midna assuming a familiar form. The Links seemed clearly upset, and asked her about what she meant by \"getting them into fighting shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, boys,\" the imp said. \"I'm gonna run you lot through the ringer, train you up, and make you into proper challenges for my lords. If I catch you slipping, I'm free to punish you boys.\" Upon hearing her say she'd punish them, they grit there teeth and angrily explained that if she tries something, they'll take her down! She took their words in, and seemed to grin. \"You're gonna beat me? Please, you couldn't survive a kiss and some boobs. Now, I might not have the latter, but I know plenty of other ways to put boys like you in line.\" At her last sentence, she slowly turned around. Towards the end of her lesson, she bent over, strutting out her shapely butt, it easily capable of covering one of the Links' faces. They blushed and shied away, hesitant to look at her, but feeling their eyes drawn towards her rump. Seeing their nervousness, she grinned, and stood upright, walking up to the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you boys know what's in store, I'll trust you're gonna behave, right?\" She fiddled with the door, and opened it up, giving the LInks the chance to step out. \"Now, follow me, I'm gonna lead you to your first training session.\" She turned around, and made her way down the hallway, strutting and really showing off those buttocks for the heroes. They felt nervous about being behind her, but they kept up their pace. They realized they had no weapons, which'd make fighting back difficult. Then again, if she was working with that Midna, they were probably walking into a trap...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They each had a colored slip on them, green, red, blue, and purple. \"To your assigned device, buds.\" At that, the group worriedly walked towards the X-devices. Suddenly, the hair from the imp flies forwards, shaped like hands. They each gripped each Links and threw them onto the X's, where they were each restrained. The imp giggled as she floated towards the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get these off of you...\" she said, gently grabbing their tunics. The Links began to squirm around, fearing what the imp planned to do with their outfits. Their fear is answered when, with a sharp tug, their tunics and tights were knocked off. The four of them were left completely naked in front of the strange creature, who had a freaky grin on her face. Her eyes scanned over them, and they each knew where she was looking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal, boys,\" she said. \"It was a few lewd attacks that did you in earlier. So, we're going to see if you can survive a few more attacks like that. I'm going to begin with some more tame stuff. If I see you guys lose yourselves to my assaults... well, you don't want to know what'll happen~\" The Links shivered in fear as she spoke.

If they simply followed her orders, then they'd risk being a victim to whatever wretched plan she and her rulers have in store. Even in spite of her teasing, they needed to stop her. Surely she was leading them to some kind of trap! So, they each tried to approach her from behind, nonchalantly. Green was right behind her, blue slightly left, red slightly right, and purple was behind. They kept close behind her, unaware of the cruel grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Green Link suddenly lunged forth, intent on tackling the shadow-y imp down onto the ground. He was sure he could land the hit, and even if she dodged Red or Blue would be able to stop her. However, instead her backside came level with his own face as she thrusted her hips upwards. Suddenly, her cheeks smacked into his face, the force of the blow knocking him backwards and causing him to stumble back. The other Links looked on in shock, not expecting her to see that coming. The imp pivoted around, and her hair flicked out, taking the shape of a large hand, wrapping around Red's torso and lifting him off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue and Purple shook off the shcok and both ran towards Midna, intent on both tackling her down, but she planted her hands against each of their foreheads, stopping their assaults. She then yanked them up, before slamming them both down onto the ground. With the Links properly knocked down, she oriented them around a little bit, each dazed for the moment. They were all packed together tightly, Red hoisted above the ground with the imp's hair. With a giggle, she stood over Green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you~\" she teased, playfully rubbing her hands over her plump buttocks. And then, she squatted down, completely covering Green's face with her butt. With those other two Links so clos to Green, she reached down... her hands coming under their tunics... and grabbing their manhoods. While those three were regaining their consciousness, the imp worked the hair resembling fingers underneath Red's tunic, a pair of those fingers pinching around Red's dick. Soon, all of the Links were back in form... and they each felt horror at their circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey immediately began squirming about in fear, not wanting her to touch them like this. Bit, a rub on Green's face, a rub on Blue and Purple's manhood, and a tickly stroke of Red's caused them all to freeze up, suddenly realizing they were entirely under her grip. Then, she stopped, and noted how each Link seemed to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems I have your attention, boys~\" she cooed out. \"I told you I'd punish you, didn't I? Well, since you guys seemed so scatter brained to still try something like that, I s'ppose I can't blame you for your error. So, I'll make you an offer. Did one of you lead that attack?\" The Links seemed confused at her question, wondering what she could possibly mean, but daring not to speak, her grip still strong on them. \"Well, if there were a mastermind, I could just punish him and release the rest of you, maybe even let you boys see what I do to naughty prisoners. So, tell me, who am I going to pulverize?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The one who... His cheeks redden at the memory of her kiss. Whoever she was, she was more powerful then the four of them were ready for. Then there were the others, what were they? Green sits up and observes his surroundings. Stone walls and barred windows only have one meaning, he was in some kind of prison. He walked to the door of his cell and looks out the bars, there's no sign of other cells and his cell was empty aside from him, that means his copies were being held elsewhere. All he sees is a door opposite his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hears footsteps approaching. The door on the other side opens up, revealing... it's her. Midna smiled at the sight of her prey waking up. While they were unconscious, the four of them decided to split them up and toy with them each in their own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there greeny. Good to see you're awake. You and your friends were hardly a challenge. Now as punishment, we are going to use you to please us, and you, my little green friend, are going to be my personal servant.\" She laughed at the terrified look forming on her captive's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Link woke up to find himself hanging from a wall. He tried to move his arms and legs, finding out they were bound with strong chains. He felt something in his mouth, keeping him from talking, but any attempt to spit it out proved futile. With no way to move or even scream in anger, he was left with nothing else to do but read the room. The walls were covered with odd tools and the floor was littered with strange devices. There was a stairway on the other side of the room, to where it leads he doesn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust where was he? His questions were mostly answered when he heard clicking noises coming from the stairs. He focused on them and saw her. That bitch that got the drop on him. She now dawned a skintight leather outfit colored red like his tunic, and rather sharp-looking heels. \"Hello my new toy. I'm going to enjoy breaking you. Hehehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue Link found himself in a small space. It seemed to be some sort of cage. Sitting up, he felt a cold sensation on his butt. Looking down, he made the shocking discovery that he was stark naked, with the exception of a collar around his neck. Before he could question anything, he was visited by the woman from before, still sporting her... *ahem, 'enhancements'. \"Well, looks like my new doggy is up and ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple Link found his predicament quite uncomfortable. Having already been awake for what he assumed was a half hour, he had already gotten a feel for his surroundings. He wore little more then a padded cloth around his waist, and his current cell had only bars but no roof. Try as he may though, he couldn't climb out. The rest of the room was empty with a door that led to somewhere he didn't know yet. As he questioned where it led, it opened up to reveal that goddess from before. She walked over to your cell. \"Awwww, I see my little baby is awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you want to follow?</span></div></div>",

As the Guardian attacked, she raised her hand, creating a shield that reflected the attack back much stronger than before. She walked up to the mechanical monster and studied it. It was impressive and strong, but Midna knew it could be more interesting if she gave it a hand. She set her hand upon it's eye and concentrated. The robot glowed bright until it changed shape. The Guardian gained arms strong enough to grab people. As she changed the Sheikah technology, she made it so it changed the others that looked like it. Midna started to look around as the Guardian vanished. \"Oh, I'm in Hyrule field.\" Midna was happy that she recognized the area without having to look forward or backward in the future, however she wasn't entirely sure where Link was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she wanted to find him, she also wanted to change the rules of Hyrule and its threats.

Her two loyal wolves appeared and bowed in her presence. \"Split up and find Link, but do not engage. I want him fresh and ready for battle.\" The two wolves nodded and ran in opposite directions. Once he were gone, she teleported to one of the toughest enemies in the timeline: A Lynel. Midna snapped her fingers, making it pinned down. \"You are really tough. Hm, the color of the foe seems to be connected to their strength. You have a red mane, meaning you are one of the weakest of your kind. No matter, I will make you stronger.\" The Lynel struggled as she waved her hand changing the beast into a gold one. She then decided to create a gold Moblin on it as a rider.

To his surprise though, the bud opened as he approached without any offering, and from the fountain's waters sprung out four giant fairy women, each one incredibly buxom. The four of them began to look at Link seductively, fluttering their eyes and blowing kisses at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Few men would feel anything more than that before the grand beings, them towering over some of the tallest of men. Not only that, they stood among as goddesses among the surface: Cortera the blonde beauty, Kaysa the pink perfection, Mija the buxom blue, and Tera the white wonder. Were they not divine-like beings, they'd probably have hundreds of men vying for their hand in marriage. But right now, they resided in a bud and awaited the arrival of those that'd offer rupees to them. At least, that was what Link heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously stepped forwards, climbing up onto a bunch of mushrooms forming a ramp up to the flower, those ladies still towering over him. He briefly considered that these weren't the creatures he was seeking, that this was somehow a trap. Surely not. They certainly exude the aura of the kind of creature he was trying to find. So, still hesitant, he stood before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this little guy? Is he the big hero boy?\" Mija asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he certainly looks the part~\" Kaysa said affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't look like any ordinary voe~\" Tera added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down, you're scaring him,\" Cortera said. The four still loomed in close as Link looked up at them, him still seeming fairly intimidated. They still bore welcoming smiles. \"Well...? You didn't come here just to gawk at a few pretty women, did you?\" At that, Link was snapped out of his confusion. He shook his head at that. \"Of course not! No, you need a hand in defeating the Calamity, don't you? Well, having been repowered, we should be more than able to help you!\" Link let out a sigh of relief as the previous tension seemed to wear off now. It seemed he could just leave this as business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're well versed in blessing armors,\" Mija explained. \"As long as you have the proper material, we'll be able to make your clothing stronger.\" Link felt more calm as they spoke. It seemed like this would be a normal transaction after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just need you to offer these clothes to us~\" Kaysa said. That was a problem. Link, unfortunately, had only come to them with the clothes on his back and a few items he'd grabbed during his travel. He'd hate to end up exposing himself to them (and that's with him not knowing about their more dubious motives), but stronger gear would help him greatly. </span></div></div>",

She quickly traveled to Gerudo Town - a village of Amazonian warriors ruled by a young, beautiful chieftain. They were already nearly perfectly suited to her plans, but for one small problem. Their village didn't allow men. That would make arranging the interactions she wanted a bit more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took care of that little problem with a wave of her hand. All males were still disallowed from Gerudo Town, with one notable exception - the Hylian Hero Link. She ensured that all Gerudo would recognize Link on sight and escort him immediately to the Chieftan's throne room - her next stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she secretly observed Chief Riju and her bodyguard Buliara discussing the challenges their town faced. Her eyes settled on the large bodyguard. Buliara was intimidating by anyone's standards, and she was the elite amongst the elite within Gerudo. Tall, muscular, brave, and tough. She was the object of Midna's focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twilight Princess planted a thought in the minds of Riju and Buliara. On seeing Link, his challenge was to be one of unarmed combat against the bodyguard. To make things a little more fun, she increased Buliara's already impressive stature so that the hero would stand to her knee instead of her thick waist. As a final touch, she planted a seed of desire for Link, copied from Paya, deep within Buliara. This would be fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was not completely heartless, she also returned the Thunder Helm the Yiga Clan had stolen to the Gerudo vault and erased any memories of the theft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...should she sit and wait for the show or are there other modifications she wanted to make elsewhere?</span></div></div>",

She gets word from her minions that he is on is way to Gerudo Town, but that he is dressed a bit unusually. The hero's disguise is seen through quickly and he is escorted to the Chief's' throne room immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Link, the Twilight Princess laughs loudly, but ensures that only she can hear it. Before her stands the great hero Link, dressed as the daintiest Hyrulian woman! She loved every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hero Link as you wished Chief,\" the armed guard who escorted Link into the room stated bluntly before swiftly escorting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook his head. If he knew he had been requested, he wouldn't have gone through all that trouble to get this dumb disguise. Not that it even worked. Upon seeing Chief Riju's guard, he swallowed hard and straightened up. She had the look of one who was not to be taken lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hero Link. What brings you to Gerudo Town?\" Chief Riju asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Riju, I've come to learn from you about Divine Beast Van Naboris, to free our lands from Calamity Gannon,\" he said swiftly and confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodyguard slammed the edge of her sword on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you use our Chief's name?! Show her the respect she is due. Kneel in her presence voe,\" Buliara ordered sternly. Riju chuckled at the stiffness of her bodyguard, but did not offer any objection. Link had no choice but to bow. Both women smiled at the sight of the hero dropping to a knee before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing's first Link,\" Riju started, \"That silly costume of yours isn't necessary. It almost disgusts me. Please remove it.\" she stated with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink squirmed, but disrobed as requested. He returned to a knee wearing nothing but his undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" the Chief continued, sharing a knowing look with her guard. \"Now, Van Naboris. The Divine Beast has been quite the pain for us. But I don't know that you are equipped to defeat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief, I am a Champion,\" Link stated standing. \"I assure you that...\" he is cut off by Buliara's sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not interrupt or argue with the chief Voe,\" she commanded. Her stern face revealing a slight smirk. The hylian returned to a knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying. To prove that you are capable of taking on Van Naboris and earning our trust, you must pass a test. Buliara here is our greatest warrior. Defeat her in unarmed combat and you will get the information you need.\" the chief said with a smile. She was starting to squirm in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unarmed Chief?\" Link asks. He was much better with his full arsenal at his disposal. Buliara dwarfed him in strength and stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I don't want any bloodshed. This is just a simple test after all,\" Riju responded with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink finally acquiesced as he was given little choice in the matter. Buliara escorted him to the training area where the test would be held. The hero's pulse grew rapid. As confident as he was, he didn't know how he would defeat a woman of her strength and size without his weapons. Buliara also felt her heartbeat quicken, but for a much different reason. She was oddly excited at the opportunity to get her hands on the small hylian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuliara removed her armor and stood across from Link wearing just pink tights that hugged her incredible hips and thighs along with a green chest plate that did little to disguise the size of her breasts. Link noticed her breasts heaving as the seemingly calm woman started to breathe rapidly in anticipation of the fight. They both assumed a ready position as Riju wiggled in her seat in anticipation of seeing her champion face the famous hero. Midna floats above the training area with a huge smile on her face. This is coming together nicely. </span></div></div>",

Her smile is matched by the Gerudo Chief. Riju crosses her legs to attempt to hide her excitement of the site of the small, yet still strong and handsome hero, prepared to battle her greatest warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuliara's smile was somehow even broader. She licked her lips in anticipation of the opportunity to wrestle with the little Hylian. She'd have to remember to thank her chief for the opportunity later. Link, on the other hand, was not smiling. He had to defeat Van Naboris to save Hyrule, and he needed to pass this test to earn that opportunity. How he would manage that without weapons against a woman nearly three times his size was a completely different question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to fight me little voe,\" Buliara taunted, \"Or just stand there admiring the view?\" she chuckled, turning to the side and caressing her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook off her taunt and charged, aiming to take out her legs to make this a fight on equal standing. The captain of the guard was ready for that tactic though. As he prepared to launch himself at her exposed knee, Buliara bent slightly and delivered a sharp hip check, sending Link sprawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some champion,\" Buliara laughed before pressing her advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily plucked the hero off the ground and gathered him in an enormous bear hug. Link felt his chest compressing within her grasp, but was more focused on her massive chest that had engulfed his head. He squirmed and struggled, but couldn't pull his face out from between her massive tits. Buliara eased her grip and laughed, causing her breasts to bounce and jiggle against the hero's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmppph!\" Link protested and tried to squirm away, but even her light grasp was still too much for him to overcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large Gerudo continued to laugh as she dropped to the floor of the training area, her breasts hovering over Link's face. The hero was planted on his back beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we said no weapons Hylian, but I'm fortunate enough to come equipped with these bombs wherever I go,\" she said, shaking her chest inches above his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuliara's laughter grew louder as she battered him with her breasts, swinging her chest from side to side. Each swing carried a wallop and Link grew dizzy as the soft flesh crashed into his face over and over again. Finally, the barrage of breast beating stopped, but only for a moment before the Gerudo warrior dropped onto the hero, smothering him with her chest. She wrapped her long arms around the back of his head and pulled him closer to her. She held him tightly enough that he couldn't get away, but still allowed him enough room to breathe. She was having far too much fun to let him pass out yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle had hardly begun, but Link was already clearly well out of his league. Buliara's soft flesh had become his whole world. It was all he could feel. It was all he could see. As he breathed, he smelled her scent and slight perfume drift and start to take over his mind. Despite the pain he was in, he couldn't help but start to get excited at the position this amazonian warrior had him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...what's that?\" Buliara asked, feeling something hard brushing up against her stomach. She pulled back, letting Link collapse to the floor and her eyes grew wide at the site of his erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see you've snuck a sword into the arena yourself,\" she says with a chuckle. Link blushes, but is in no position to argue as he is gasping for air on the floor. \"I'm going to need to...investigate this further,\" she says lustfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Buliara stands to her full height over the small Hylian and positions herself over his crotch. His eyes plead with her for mercy, but her smile tells him that none is coming. She leaps into the air and lands doing the splits - her crotch crashing into his. The pain the hero feels is incredible, but the pleasure centers in his mind overcome the pain receptors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, yes this is definitely formidable,\" Buliara chuckles as she bounces her tights covered hips over his erection. They simultaneously let out moans of pleasure. Riju, watching jealously, licks her lips at the sight of her best warrior riding the hero mercilessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuliara starts to work up a sweat, the bouncing and grinding have taken her to a place she hasn't been in sometime. Link was the first man to enter the village in eons, and she was taking full advantage. Link, on the other hand, was not nearly as prepared. As her covered crotch continued to pound away at his erection, he grew weaker and weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buliara....please....\" he pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his voice pulls the warrior from her pleasure filled dream and back into the moment. She sends a terrifying smile down at Link before rolling off of his crotch. The hero moans at his lack of release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get back to that later, but for now, we have more...pressing matters. Like that little voe face of yours,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had no idea what she meant. Pressing? His stamina was far too low to really press the question. Her meaning became crystal clear as she confidently walked around to his head and caressed her ass, clad only in skin tight, pink panties. Buliara bent at the knees, the hero could only marvel from the floor as her muscular thighs flexed high above him before she shot into the air once again. His mouth dropped as her bring pink ass dropped rapidly towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excited, but whispered \"Yessss,\" from Riju was all that he heard before Buliara's massive ass crashed onto his head. She hopped and shifted in place, grinding and \"pressing\" his face firmly beneath her. She smiled again as she once again saw his erection spring to life proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like you're enjoying this little match as much as I am my little champion,\" Buliara laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted in place again, enjoying Links muffled groans beneath her before clamping her cheeks tightly around his head. With his head locked in place, she bounced firmly several times, forcing his head deeper into her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You claim to be a champion Link? It seems like your title, at least here in Gerudo Town, would be better as 'cushion'.\" Buliara mocked the hero beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think my chief?\" the warrior asked, directing her attention to Riju, \"Shall I fashion the Hylian into a royal cushion for you?\" the two Gerudo women laughed loudly at the thought of the fabled warrior serving as a cushion beneath the Chief's smaller backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiju didn't respond beyond the laugh, so Buliara was content to continue having her fun. She stood over the badly battered and beaten Link. She pressed her foot against his crotch, eliciting something between a moan and a pained groan, and smiled at Riju. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Chief? It appears Link failed your test. We await your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Riju decide?</span></div></div>",

As long as she was willing to share. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain escorted, or rather carried, Link to the bustling town square. The women of the village paused what they were doing at the sight of the outstanding captain carrying a....a voe? Their eyes grew wider as they recognized the voe as the well known champion Link. Buliara smirked as she realized she had every eye in town on her. Hidden from sight, Midna wore an even broader smile. She was glad she chose Gerudo Town as the source of her entertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Gerudo Town!\" Buliara commanded, \"You might recognize this voe as Link. Our Chief has made an exception to our standing law denying access to our village due to his storied accomplishments. He traveled here to offer his assistance. But when tested by our wise chief, he was found....lacking,\" she chuckled as she callously dropped Link to the hard, hot floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since he's here anyway, with a desire to assist us, our chief has ordered that he is to be a servant to the people of Gerudo Town until he proves himself worthy. He is yours....ours....to use as we see fit. Just do not allow him out of the city's walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden whisper filled the crowd, along with many giggles. Link swallowed hard at the reaction this announcement drew. He could end up in Gerudo Town for a long, long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to demonstrate some of our...guest's uses,\" Buliara said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave!\" she ordered to Link, \"Remove my sandles,\" she said with a glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hylian hesitated, but acted under Buliara's harsh stare, with the memory of his utter humiliation at her hands fresh in his mind. He crawled to her feet and quickly removed her sandles. One foot alone could easily engulf his entire face with room to spare. As he saw the dirt and dust that had built up on her skin, he shuddered at what her next command would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he anticipated, she didn't hesitate with her next order. \"Now, on your back.\" she said sternly. Her stoic expression broke with a small smirk as she watched him comply. \"Now,\" she ordered, hovering her foot over his face, \"Clean my foot. With your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink closed his eyes, but reached out and grasped her large foot, pulling it gently toward his face. He stuck out his tongue and slowly licked up and down her large sole. Buliara shuddered as she felt him at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for a demonstration slave. You'll need to improve, but I'm certain you'll get more practice,\" she chuckled as she pulled her foot away. The captain hesitated for a moment, glancing around the crowd. The normally stoic and proper soldier didn't like being vulnerable with an audience, but her desire for Link was stronger, so she pushed her doubts aside and pulled down her skin tight leggings, revealing her large, muscular ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted a foot on each side of Link's head and let him stare at her enormous, intimidating backside for a few moments before slowly lowering herself. This was not a battle, there was no need to rush things. She wanted to enjoy every moment of it. As she felt her flesh make contact with Link's face, she saw a familiar rise start to reveal itself in Link's undergarment, causing her to smile broader before giving her next command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now slave, it's time to put that tongue back to work,\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former champion wanted to protest, but it resulted in simple buzzing within the depths of Buliara's ass. When she didn't feel his tongue, she clenched her cheeks over his head, slowly applying pulverizing pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Said. Lick.\" she commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven no choice, Link slowly stuck his tongue out and rubbed it against the Gerudo's top solder's crack. He could taste the salty sweat that had built up, but he wasn't forced to lick for long. On impact, Buliara felt giddy. She returned to bouncing and shimmying over the defenseless hylian's head. Licking was impossible, but the captain didn't care at this point. She was riding the hero for all he was worth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuliara was pulled out of her lust filled stupor by the sound of the towns people gasping. She smiled and wiped the sweat from her face before slowly standing and revealing Link's battered face below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she said, still nude from the waist down but attempting to compose herself, \"Who will be the first to have their turn?\" </span></div></div>",

Link barely had enough time to snap out of the booty-induced haze Buliara put him in when the first woman in line approached, and his jaw dropped at the sight of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just as imposingly tall as Buliara, sporting curves to rival hers. However, Buliara was a trained warrior, boasting a figure that was firm and muscular in many areas. This woman was not. A testament to the life of hedonistic leisure she lived, her luxurious body was plumper than Buliara\u2019s, but her excess weight clearly went to all the right places, making her thick curves appear invitingly soft rather than intimidatingly powerful. She was a rich noblewoman, dressed in exquisite clothing not unlike something the chieftain would wear, and she was eager for some one-on-one time with the legendary hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends forward, intentionally treating Link to a mind-numbing display of her deep, tanned cleavage hanging right in front of him. \u201cWhy hello there, little voe\u201d she said with a dainty wave, making her enormous bosom wobble from the slight gesture. She had a hungry gleam in her eye as she spoke.  \u201cLooks like I get the honor of having you all to myself first.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor five minutes\u2026,\u201d Buliara bluntly added. While she was willing to share Link for the benefit of her people, Buliara still can\u2019t help but feel a bit jealous, already getting a bit restless for more time with Link herself. SHE was the one who had him first, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noblewoman didn\u2019t bother giving Link her name, not wanting to waste a second of her playtime, but she could tell by the cute, awestruck look on his face that she made quite the first impression regardless. The hero looked so adorable in person that she just had to squeeze the living daylights out of him! She quickly got down on her knees and glomped herself against Link, barely giving him a chance to yelp before her massive breasts smoosh against his head, shoulders, and upper body. While the noblewoman obviously wasn\u2019t a warrior, her amazonian frame and Gerudo heritage still granted her more than enough strength to easily overwhelm Link with her overly-affectionate hug, stuffing his face against her perfumed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is just what I needed,\u201d she sang while continuing to squeeze Link like a cuddle toy. \u201cThings have been ever so boring and lonely up in my mansion lately, but playing with you is just the little pick-me-up I needed.\u201d Continuing to give Link the biggest facefull he could possibly get, the noblewoman grabbed the back of his head and began to move it in slow, enticing circles against each of her breasts. Left. Right. Leeeeeft. Riiiiight. She purred as she enjoyed the sensation of his cute little facial features dragging across her sensitive skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Link began to get dizzy from the lack of air, she pulled his head back, revealing the deep blush on his face as he gasped for air. She chuckled. \u201cLooks like the legendary hero has been enjoying my legendary chest,\u201d she teased, pointing out his erection poking against her stomach. \u201cNot that I blame you, of course. It\u2019s the pride and joy of Gerudo Town, after all. The biggest and the best,\u201d she boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuliara rolled her eyes. \u201cHmph, as if,\u201d she muttered. Whether the noblewoman\u2019s boasting was true or not, Link still found himself in the exact same situation he was in with Buliara: embarrassingly manhandled and aroused by just the feminine features of a woman that towered over him, his rational mind practically smothered into submission while his lust overtook him. Buliara watched intently as Link\u2019s feeble resistance quickly faded away again. The noblewoman\u2019s tactics were much...gentler than Buliara\u2019s in a few ways, albeit more overbearing in a few more ways. Even so, Buliara couldn\u2019t argue with the results, enjoying the hopelessly flustered look on Link\u2019s face, despite the fact that she wasn\u2019t the one causing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wasn\u2019t the only one getting aroused from the prolonged contact, and the woman made that abundantly clear to him when she suddenly pulled down on her top, baring one of her breasts and aiming a turgid nipple directly at him. His jaw dropped at the sight, giving her the perfect opportunity to shove his face back against her breast and force her large nipple into his mouth. His tongue instinctively lapped at the darkly-colored nub, sending shivers down her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, if only I could take you back home with me,\u201d she gushed. She stroked the back of his head as she talked, gently goading him to lovingly suck on her nipple. \u201cJust think: the legendary hero could be my little servant-toy. You could dote on me while I indulged myself with you. But don\u2019t worry, little voe\u2026\u201d While pressing his head as firmly as possible to her breast with one hand, she reached down towards Link\u2019s erection  with her other hand and began to stroke it through his undergarment, making his whole body spasm in pleasure as he continued to suck on her massive tit. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to indulge you too.~\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Buliara said indignantly as she gestured for the woman to get off Link. \u201cYour five minutes are up. If you want more time with him, get to the back of the line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh poo.\u201d The wealthy Gerudo gave a little pout as she got up and fixed herself. \u201cTime really does fly when you\u2019re having fun. Oh well. See you later, my little voe, and that\u2019s a promise. Just try not to miss me too much while I\u2019m gone.~\u201d She strutted off, leaving behind Link in a lust-filled daze with a small but obvious stain leaking through his undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext!\u201d Link heard footsteps approaching as Buliara called the next person in line, barely giving him any chance to recover. When he looked up to see who was approaching, there was a moment when he thought he was still dizzy from what just happened, because it looked like he was seeing double!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s eyes widened as he saw two perky young gerudo girls bounce their way towards him. It was a pair of bodacious twins, and they were absolutely giddy about toying around with Link. <br>\r\nHaving just returned from the beach when Buliara offered Link to the town, the twins were dressed in matching swimsuits, one red and the other blue. Clearly younger than some of the other Gerudo women Link met so far, these sisters weren\u2019t nearly as imposingly tall or astonishingly voluptuous as the likes of Buliara or the noblewoman, but they still had more than enough curves stacked between the two of them to send Link for a loop if they wanted, not to mention their endless reserves of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, can you believe it, sis,\u201d one sister excitedly asked the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right? We\u2019ve actually got a champion as our boy-toy. How lucky are we?\u201d The sisters squealed and clapped their hands in tandem, continuing to give Link a bouncy show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy it while it lasts, girls,\u201d Buliara muttered under her breath. \u201cJust be sure to make it entertaining, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp, we\u2019ve only got ourselves a few minutes with him. What should we do with him first,\u201d one sister ponders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Ooh! I know! How about we try that thing we\u2019ve been wanting to do? We\u2019ve finally got someone to try it out on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat idea, sis!\u201d The bubbly girls positioned themselves on either side of Link and pulled him up to his knees while facing away from him, each sister grabbing one of his arms and straddling it between her legs as they did. Before Link could even wonder what they were up to, they shoved their large rears against his head, instantly smothering it between them. Link gave a muffled groan as the sisters rolled his head around between them, playfully gyrating their hips while putting as much pressure on his head as possible with their plump posteriors. \u201cHaha, see!? I told you our butts are nearly big enough to fully trap someone\u2019s head between them. You can barely tell it\u2019s there,\u201d one sister cheered as they both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t kidding. Nearly engulfed between the bubbly twin\u2019s bubble butts, the only trace of Link\u2019s head between was the tuft of hair sticking out from the top of their combined ass crevice. If they were just a little bigger and a little thicker, there would\u2019ve been no trace of Link from his shoulders and up. \u201cAnd look, he\u2019s totally loving this too,\u201d one of the sisters happily pointed out, noting that Link is still pitching a huge tent in his undergarments as they continue to pummel his head with their butts. \u201cI guess the champion of the voes is a sucker for big asses too, hee hee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2019ve told you that,\u201d Buliara scoffed to herself. She had to admit, though, that wasn\u2019t a bad pose. Seeing how well the sisters toyed with Link while showing off both his humiliation and horniness to the crowd made her wish she could try that move on Link with someone too. Sadly, Buliara wasn\u2019t the only one getting excited from such an enticing display. After seeing first-hand some of the things that could be done to Link, no one in Gerudo Town was willing to patiently wait in line anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the surprise of Link, Buliara, and the twins (who hadn\u2019t finished their turn yet), the villagers suddenly rushed them. Things instantly turned chaotic as every woman there tried to claim Link for herself. In the middle of the riot, Link feels someone grab him and secretly drag him away to someplace private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Have fun with the little voe till your heart\u2019s content,\u201d Buliara sings, still not bothering to pull up her pants. She steps aside to let her Gerudo sister have her turn. Link looks up at the woman and is startled by what he sees. That\u2019s no Gerudo at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMida stands above Link, choosing this time to appear to him in her true form rather than her imp form. In her true form, the Twilight Princess looks as elegant and regal as she does drop-dead sexy. She boasts an unbelievably leggy and curvaceous figure beneath a tight, scantily-clad outfit an exotic belly-dancer might wear. Unfamiliar with the Twili in this timeline, Link merely looks at Midna with stunned awe, but with a snap of her fingers Link\u2019s mind is suddenly filled with memories from another timeline, allowing him to instantly recognize her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashes him an impish smile that he\u2019d recognize no matter what form she\u2019s in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Link? Surprised to see a multi-dimensional goddess,\u201d she taunts. \u201cHope you like what i\u2019ve done with the place, cause you and I are gonna have lots of fun in this sandbox of a world you got here.\u201d She turns around, showing off her trademark, jaw-dropping rear. \u201cBut first: how\u2019s about a seat?\u201d Midna promptly sits down onto Link\u2019s crotch, effortlessly knocking the wind out of him as her lower body engulfs his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinds her hips left and right, skifully shimmying her ass in a way that stiffens his member against her almost immediately. \u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: how\u2019s a Twili like me able to get along so well with all these Gerudo women,\u201d she says coyly, knowing damn well that most of Link\u2019s thoughts are on her bouncy ass. \u201cWell that\u2019s all thanks to a handy illusion spell I whipped up. Right now, everyone here except you sees me as a fellow Gerudo woman.\u201d Midna gestures to Buliara, as well as the crowd of women watching, all of them cheering Midna on as if she were one of their one. Buliara in particular watches raptly, eagerly looking for inspiration for the next time she has her turn with Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, though: these curves are still 100% real,\u201d Midna caveats, taking Link\u2019s hand and forcing him to grope her vast chest while she continues to grind her plump ass against his crotch. Even while smack dab in the middle of a village packed with voluptuous amazons, the Twilight Princess\u2019 bombastic figure is more than capable of standing out in a crowd. \u201cJust consider this illusion spell the mystical equivalent of a palette swap...not that you\u2019d know what that means,\u201d she snickers. Normally Link would be annoyed at Midna\u2019s condescending tone, but it\u2019s hard to focus on anything else besides the copious amounts of female flesh pressing against his nearly naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, all you need to worry about are the oodles of surprises and plans I have in store for you. Depending on how well you play along, the two of us will never be bored again.\u201d Before Link can even manage to get a word in edgewise, Mida turns and gives him a breathtaking kiss, overwhelming his face with her plump lips. \u201c<i>*Mwah*</i> I\u2019m looking forward to it.~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOptions:<br>\r\n1.

She made sure the creature could recognize Link and want to toy with him and Riju. She also made sure the divine beast could speak. One more thing Midna did was change the lightning attack so it would mainly stun Link so it could catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna went to Vah Medoh and basically did the same for it(giving it a more female humanoid form, making sure it could speak and recognize Link and his ally, having to enter its mouth). A special thing Midna did though was give the divine beast a stable nest at the top of Talonto mountain as a place to take Link to to play with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna went to Vah Rudania and made the same changes as the other two. A special change for this divine beast though was the sentries it sent out also had a humanoid appearance now and could grab Link. Midna also made it easy for Link to enter and exit Vah Rudania\u2019s mouth once it had fallen into the volcano (since the main terminal was on the outside of the body).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVah Ruta was next. Midna made her normal changes to it just like the others. For this one however, Midna made the divine beast a bit slimmer than normal elephants. She also made sure it would be able to suck Link up with its trunk(if Link found himself alone in the water).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna made sure the insides of their bodies wouldn\u2019t digest Link(to give him a chance) and smiled at her work. This idea really interested her. It kind of made her want to act like divine beast herself, but that couldn\u2019t happen\u2026\u2026 or could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna thought about this for a second.</span></div></div>",

Midna smirked, thinking about how she could use Paya. With a wave of her hand, Midna made Paya want Link a lot. After a few minutes, Link stepped out and Paya wrapped her arms around him.

She looked through her options multiple times, carefully deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad I can't just create a new time period.\" She thought to herself. However, her search soon slowed down to a stop as she thought more about it. \"A new time. . .\" Midna concentrated and thought deeply. \"Perhaps. . . maybe I could. I have the power, I could make challenges. I wonder. . .\" After a minute of thinking, the Twilight Princess smiled. \"Well, let me give it a shot. It's not like I have to worry about consequences.\" With a snap of her fingers, she teleported out of her world and created a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just an empty void of nothing, but that gave Midna room to work with. She decided to follow the goddesses footsteps by creating Hyrule similar to how they did. She started with creating the land, adding landmarks like Death mountain, Lake Hylia, a snowy mountain and other areas. She made the world quite big and added some some towns for later and made sure to put Hyrule castle in the center. One more location she added was a special forest with a deep cave, this would be infested with a lot of monsters later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Midna added universal laws and physics just like Nayrue. She didn't change much at all for this part, Midna didn't feel the need to make thing's different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part was the segment that Midna was waiting for, adding life to the world. She first started with the normal Hylians, starting off small. She made the shopkeepers more aggressive and powerful. If Link went into a shop but didn't buy anything, the shopkeepers could make Link pay in some way. Midna added one more touch to the common folks, a few would actually be monsters who look like Hylians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then added the Gorons and made them rock <b>and</b> meat eaters. For Zoras, she added them with the feeling of great dominance and superiority over other creatures. Midna also added the Rito, adding only a few, but made them large enough to be able to hold a Hylian in their claws/feet. The Gerudo was next, and she kept them the same except for one detail. If a man was caught in their territory, the intruder would have a much rougher time than just being locked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemies were next, and she made sure to add quite a few. She made sure to add Bokoblins, Moblins, Lizalfos, and Chuchus. The Twilight Princess made sure to make them aggressive and love dominating creatures like Hylians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidna finally created princess Zelda, and made her quite smart and kind, but playful and mischievous at times. Link wasn't changed, but that was the challenge. Midna put Link in a small town called Norwich and decided to make both him and Zelda adults. As she created them, she made sure to create the Triforce and give the two their pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer final step was to invade the kingdom she just made and start Link on his quest. To start, she decided to. . .</span></div></div>",

She enters the world and ghosts herself so she can look around. From what she can see though, this Hyrule looks rather... plain, with very little to make it unique from other worlds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'm not here to sightsee, I'm here to screw with Link and that's what I'm gonna do. Now I just need to sense out that hero's spirit every Link has aaaanndd... gotcha.\" She takes off in the direction she sensed Link was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon came upon a cuckoo farm. \"Rather plain for a hero.\" Midna muses to herself before remembering that her own Link started out as a simple goat herder. \"Now where are you Link?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flies inside right to where she senses the hero's spirit. Only instead of the standard elf-eared mute boy she was expecting, it was a girl. She looked about the age of the average Link, and even looked a lot like him, but it couldn't be, could it? She takes a quick look into what this world is to see what's happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, in this world, rather than Link, the hero destined to defeat evil was instead a girl named Linkle. Well this certainly put a damper on Midna's plans, but not enough to stop her. Male or female, a Link was a Link, and this \"Linkle\" was a Link alright. She would certainly have fun with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, she needed more intel on this world. For starters, was everyone in this world a gender-bent version of their traditional counterparts, or was Link/Linkle the only one to get that treatment? </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Midna, the famous Twilight Princess, grew into a powerful being. In addition to her normal powers, she even acquired god-like abilities. Unfortunately, when you become a god, you get bored easily. Midna's growing bored with her life in her kingdom. However, there's one game she's yet to play. And she knows the perfect little pawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has the power to go from timeline to timeline, and uses this power to find the \"Link\" of that world, and then mess with them. Now, she couldn't simply mess with him outright. That'd be too easy. No, she could rearrange that world to present a little play-area for him. She can make the people/monsters of the world be more... aggressive with him. And she'd love nothing more than to see some adventurer struggle to avoid some powerful creature's dominating aura. Whether they eat him, sit on him, or -ahem- <i>play</i> with him, she wants to savor every moment of the poor adventurer's humiliation. And even if Link falls in battle, she can just rewind time to before he loses, just so she can watch him struggle some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she gets her sights on a Link, she usually thrusts some handicap on him, with the end goal of finding and defeating her in battle, though she promises there's no way he'll win. Handicaps can range from turning him into a wolf, to making him gummy, to making him feel especially submissive, and so much more. And, as if that isn't bad enough, she's got a duo of dangerous female twili-wolves, April and May, to hunt him down. Usually when she hosts a game, she'll have these two hidden somewhere. When the game starts, they leave their hiding spot, with the goal of finding and dominating the adventurer. If they find him, there's no telling what they'll do. If Link isn't moving constantly, he could become victim to April and May's domineering attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n1. At the beginning, players will be able to choose a timeline for this event to take place in. Please keep relevant beings, besides Midna and her Twili, in their respective timelines.<br>\r\n2. At the beginning, don't create a dead end for timelines for the story to follow.<br>\r\n3. Refrain from excessive gore, watersports, scat, and detailed digestion.<br>\r\n4. Doms of either gender are fine, but they have to be at least older than 18.<br>\r\n5. Don't be nonsensical with your next entry. There should be a relatively understandable flow to the plotline.<br>\r\n6. Feral and anthro doms are allowed.    <br>\r\n7. Don't end plotlines too soon.<br>\r\n8. The game isn't restricted to canon \"worlds,\" meaning the Link could be from a made up Timeline. However, if you make up a Timeline, you should explain a few details about it.<br>\r\n</td>",
