The three toddlers were watching a scary movie where a Mad Scientist replaced all the children's parents with robots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last, my experiment is almost complete! Soon I will replace every man, woman and child with my robots and take over the world!\" said the Mad Scientist, and he laughed evilly.
