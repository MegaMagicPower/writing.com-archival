Tommy was dressed in a red shirt and a diaper, Kimi was dressed in a pink shirt and a diaper, and Chuckie was dressed in a lavender pajama shirt and light blue and purple striped pajama shorts. The three toddlers were watching a scary movie where a Mad Scientist replaced all the children's parents with robots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last, my experiment is almost complete! Soon I will replace every man, woman and child with my robots and take over the world!\" said the Mad Scientist, and he laughed evilly. Tommy, Chuckie, and Kimi watched in horror as the Mad Scientist brought the robot to life with his lightning ray. The robot stood upright by tipping the bed forward, then gradually started to smile. As the robot began walking towards a door, a Little Boy opened the door and recognized the robot as his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! Dad! You're a robot!\" The Little Boy shouted.

You can't spend the rest of your life being held back by baby things like wearing diapers.
