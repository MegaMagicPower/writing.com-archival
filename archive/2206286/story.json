She was 6'1\", so that attracted a lot of attention for her, but she wasn't interested in dating. She wanted to get her own life squared away first before she'd ever think of doing something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it, another Friday, another lame ass weekend. What else changed around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren didn't think much would happen this weekend, so she just decided to change into simpler clothes and figured she'd just be Netflixing all weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren came back out in a long sleeve shirt and PJ shorts and just sat down for a good chunk of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on in the night though, Karen's doorbell rang. Not expecting visitors, Karen cautiously opened the door, and noticed a small package. Confused, but noticing it was addressed to her, she took the package in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck? I don't remember ordering anything from Amazon this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Karen opened the box, she was shocked to see there was a mask in the box. Furthermore, she recognized the face on the mask to be that of her old best from college, Suzie, who passed away a year ago in a car accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzie? W-what? What the hell? I don't understand-\" Karen said in absolute shock. What the hell was this mask? And just who exactly sent it to her, and why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Karen do next?</span></div></div>",

What the hell is this and who could've possibly sent it?\" As Karen flipped the mask around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was just so in awe of the whole situation she didn't notice how she was bringing the mask closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this mask supposed to mean some-\" right before the mask latches onto her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMPH!\" Karen couldn't control what was going on as the mask soon engulfed her whole face! She desperately tried to take the mask off to no avail. As she was helplessly trying to rip the mask off her face, the mask almost seemed to merge, or melt, into Karen's face, almost like as if the mask was Karen's real face after all. Karen's hair also started transforming from blonde to black on top of that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. CAN'T. TAKE. THIS. MASK. OFF!\" Karen's last words before she ultimately lost consciousness. And before you know it, there stood Karen with only one difference. She stood there with Suzie's head! And now there was someone else piloting Karen's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... What the hell happened? Where am I?\"<br>\r\nSaid Suzie, before taking in the reality of the situation. \"What? Who's nice apartment is this? And how'd I end up here? Wasn't I just driving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Suzie began to take a walk around, she immediately noticed something different. \"Why does this room feel so small? What the hell?\" Suzie then catches herself in a mirror on the wall, noticing the very tall body she's now piloting. \"What the fuck? First I'm in some fancy apartment, now my body just grew? Something's not right here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie started walking around the apartment trying to look for clues, noticing several pictures of Karen, her old best friend from college lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is Karen's apartment? Maybe if I find her, she could explain what's going on... Right? But first where's my phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie couldn't find her own phone of course, but she did run into another phone just lying on the coffee table. She picked the phone up and it asked for her fingerprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, worth a shot I guess.\" Said Suzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the phone her fingerprint, only for the phone to say \"Welcome back, Karen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? WHAT? Karen? I'm not Karen! I'm Suzie! I'm-\" But that's when it all adds up. The fancy apartment she mysteriously ended up in, the very tall body she saw in the mirror, this must be Karen's body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How- how is this possible? Karen? You still in there somewhere?\" Suzie figured since this is Karen's body but it's still her face, she felt around her face and neck to find some way to reverse this. Indeed, she found a little tiny flap at the edge of her jawline. Pulling off the flap would take the whole mask off, thus reversing Karen's head back to her own, and giving her control of her own body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm gonna do that, there's a chance that soon as I take the mask off, Karen will have no idea of what happened. She might've blacked out as soon as she put the mask on. Maybe if I leave her some kind of message...\" And that's when Suzie noticed the phone again. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recording the message for Karen to find later, Suzie now had to decide. Should she take the mask off now so Karen can know what's been going on? Or should she put that to the side and get to know what it's like having Karen's body first?</span></div></div>",

She grabbed the edge of the mask and peeled it off, with her head reverting back to Karens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what the hell happened? I blacked out? And wasn't I just standing over there?\" Karen then took a glance at her phone on the coffee table and saw-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUZIE!?\" It couldn't be! It was her <b>best friend</b> and it looked like she must've recorded a message for her. Karen quickly played the video and deduced everything: that the mask must've contained Suzie's soul, and whoever puts it on unleashes her soul, and allows Suzie to possess that body. It was definitely all strange and weird for anyone to hear, but Karen didn't care, this was her chance to bring her best friend back into her life! Still, IF she allowed Suzie back into her life, what if Suzie got careless one day and decided not to remove the mask? That would imprison Karen in her own body forever! The mask could be dangerous....</span></div></div>",

They can talk more about the rules of sharing their body afterwards. In the meantime, she still has a job you know! With that, you save the video, and put the mask back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, she put the mask back on? She must really trust me...\" You catch the phone Karen left in your hand and see the message she recorded. \"Karens letting me borrow her body... FOR THE WEEKEND?? WHAT?\" You couldn't be more grateful for the decision Karen made for you! \"Thank you so much for this Karen! I'll pay it back to you I swear! Thank you!\" Now, with Karen giving you permission to use her body for the weekend, you had a lot of time to figure out what you wanna do before going back to sharing the body with Karen.</span></div></div>",

You turn it on, leave it to some sitcom, sit down and kick your feet up on the coffee table. First thing you noticed was how long your new legs were and how big your feet are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it'll definitely take me a while to get used to piloting a body this big\" Suzie said as she flexed her foot. Then she whipped out her phone to check herself out. Suzie was pretty pale for an Asian, so at least her head could blend well with the rest of Katie's body. Thing is however, is that Suzie was always naturally small, so seeing her head perched on top of Katie's thick neck, was definitely a weird sight, but nothing too abnormal. Walking around in public like this can definitely be believable, better Katie than some dark skinned girl. THAT would definitely attract attention. Speaking of going around in public, Suzie wondered what she would even do for the weekend. It's nice Katie gave her the weekend for herself, but what could she exactly do? The world believes Suzie dead, Katie's friends only know Katie, and Katie herself was unavailable for obvious reasons. Suzie was a little scared of this idea, but had faith that she and Katie would eventually figure out how to get Suzie fully reintegrated back into society. For now, this was Suzie's weekend. She wanted to own it. With that, Suzie turned the TV off, and decided to finally lie down in her bedroom, wondering what tomorrow will bring for her.</span></div></div>",

You once were best friends with someone back in college with an Asian woman named Suzie, and you were both well known by your sheer height differences. Suzie, being 4'11\", and you, being 6'1\", it was hard to miss either of you around campus. Unfortunately, right after college graduation, you both were involved in a car accident after coming back from a party. You survived, but Suzie unfortunately didn't. Now a year later, with Karen having her own job and apartment, soon one day receives a mysterious mask in the mail, and notices the face of the mask is that of Suzie! Everytime Karen puts the mask on, her head transforms into Suzie's, as Suzie also takes control of Karen's body, while Karen herself blacks out every time she puts the mask back on. What crazy shenanigans could these *sort of* reunited best friends hold in store?</td>",
