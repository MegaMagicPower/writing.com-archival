They were both twenty years old and deeply in love. Danielle is as a cute Burnet with brown eyes and a nicely fit body, Rob was well built and very curious, he also had an infatuation with Danielle's feet, which he though she had no idea, but she did. As Rob get's ready for work there is a knock at the door, so he finishes combing his hair and walks to answer the door. Oddly enough there was no one there, yet there was a small package at ther floor. He brings it inside and puts it on the counter. He finishes getting ready and walks back over to the package, he is very curious and opens it up. Suddenly there is a bright flash and Rob falls to the floor. He wakes up in a daze and to his surprise every thing looks massive! After a little bit of observation he realizes he has been shrunk! He is now merely micro sized and the box the had done this had mysteriously vanished. Rob was now concerned as to what he was going to do, now that the box has vanished, how does he have any hope of returning to normal!? Danielle will probably think he went to work for the day and have no concern!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Rob do?</span></div></div>",

He looks around and notices two things, a dangling string near the counter and that he can now fit under any door crack.  Well we know that Rob can't stay here for long, so what should he do, start climbing the string or fit underneath a random door?</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take too long for Rob to remember from his elementary science class that an ant can lift 20 times its own body weight.  The ant sends Rob flying.  He lands on the edge of the table and rolls off the edge!  With a will to survive, he BARELY pulls himself up and collapses on top of the table.  The good news is that during the struggle he managed to get a bite of the delicious bread crumb.  The bad news is that the ant is still after him.  Rob springs up and then...</span></div></div>",

She had just recently gotten out of bed, dressed in a white tanktop and short blue shorts; she was barefoot as so were most girls when they get out of bed. She began to walk towards the table completely unaware of the trials that Rob has been through. He was relieved to see her, she looked beautiful even in the morning, there\"s only one slight problem, she doesn't see him! Danielle peered down and noticed some very small bugs roaming around on the floor close to her feet. She began to tap her right foot repetitively sending tremors throughout the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! ants in my apartment? This is certainly not going to happen, I know just how to handle this..\" Danielle says with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts her foot in the air and then plops it down in the first small ant, crushing it with her toes. She continues to destroy them, thrusting her foot down on them, carelessly stepping on multiples of them, even accidentally stepping on them without any effort at all..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the ants had all been stamped out.. none remained, except for tiny Rob. Luckily he was on the table and wasn't around for the mutilation of those tiny bugs. Danielle made some food for herself and sat down to eat it. After a little while she put her bowl in the sink and washed the dishes.  Rob had climbed down off the table in a hopes to actually get away from his girlfriend, he was a bit terrified of the way Danielle handled the ants, he didn't want her to get confused....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurly this was a bad idea, because now Danielle is incomprehensibly tall and has no clue the her boyfriend was microsized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoom! Boom! Boom! Rob could hear her footsteps approaching from off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God! she's coming right at me...\" Rob thought to himslef<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle continued to walk unaware as she grew closer to Rob...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob turned to run the other way as Danielle walked closer, her feet nearly stepped on him a few times... Soon enough Rob felt a shadow come over him, it was foot shaped...<br>\r\nHe ran faster, or at least tried to, but everything seemed to slow down.... Danielle's heel hit the ground behind him first, then the arch of her foot started to slowly come down over his tiny body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough there rest of her sexy foot fell over tiny Rib and squished him to her undersole... her toes then finally hit the ground and Danielle just casually takes another step, completely unaware that her boyfriend was now squished and plastered to her soft underfoot... </span></div></div>",

He quickly grabs the string and immediately begins to climb down. The ants begin to chomp on the string and the string rips into two. Rob falls and hits the ground, luckily he wasn't to high above the ground. \"Well that wasn't a smart idea\" he thinks as he rubs his head. Rob now back on the place he had started, begins to think of a new plan. He knows he has to warn Danielle about what happened to him. \"But how?\" he thinks. Rob scratches his head and then an idea hits him. If he shrunk, then that must mean his cellphone shrunk too. He jumps joyfully and pulls his hand into his pocket. He finds his cellphone, it had shrunk. He begins to dial Danielle's number. She picks up,\"Hello Rob\" she says. \"Danielle you won't be able to guess what happened to me!\" I scream. \"Rob! Are you there?\" she screams. 'Yes I'm here!\" I wail. \"I'm hanging up, why call if you won't talk\" she says and then clicks the phone. The line goes dead. \"Well that didn't work\" he says to himself. \"What now? I don't want to be stuck micro size forever\" he says to himself.</span></div></div>",

Standing at the door were three of Rob's friends.Rob told them to come in,but of course they couldn't hear him. Joe was holding a box in his hands. John and Marc stood  behind him.

It takes a lot out of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle asked, \"Joe why are you here?

Well I gotta go pick up Sammy. I am sure he is fine. I trust him. He doesn't have a long day today anyway if you guys want to hang out here.

I knew then that I would have to find some other means to talk to her if I was going to get any help at all. Looking around, I saw that it was getting dark and decided I had better get off Danielle and set up a base camp where I could plan out my next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not like Rob.\" said Danielle, sounding worried. \"I hope he's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" I said, though she could not hear me. \"I'll find a way to reach you, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping off, I intended to grab the fabric of her blouse and climb down but Danielle suddenly turned to leave and I missed, plummeting down to the tile floor of the kitchen.

It was quite a rush moving at what seemed like super sonic speeds. I reached the far side of the kitchen in a heartbeat and continued on into the living room where I had built a Victorian doll house from scratch for my niece. I decided that would be my base of operations as everything was made real, just miniature sized. Everything worked, including the plumbing, which I thought was a nice touch, not to mention ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u83-moRbaaM/S_ykw2L1vXI/AAAAAAAAArU/RPv_eoj-LRo/s1600/IMG_0525+2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u83-moRbaaM/S_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made it to the house without incident and walked inside the front door, very pleased and relieved that I was such a stricter for detail. Upon closing the door, I jumped, hearing a voice inside the living room of the doll house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really go all out when you build something, don't you?\" he asked in a raspy voice. \"I'm impressed, I wish I had something like this when I was watching over my daughter, it would have made the job a lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" I demanded. \"Did you have anything to do with me being like this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted and stood up from the couch where I could see him. As he walked into the light, which I made to work as well, I recognized him as Danielle's missing father, Jon. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you asked nicely, young man, I'll tell you.\" said Jon. \"Yes, I'm the one who sent you that package of dust that shrank you to the size you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why!?\" I demanded, wanting to strangle Danielle's father. \"What reason do you have to do this to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic, the process is reversible!\" said Jon, sternly. \"You can switch back and forth between sizes, once I give you the formula for the dust and the antidote.\" he paused, taking a breath. \"Why I did this is simple, my daughter, Danielle, has been cursed to forever be in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" I asked, startled. \"Who, why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was cursed by a woman who wanted me but lost to my late wife.\" replied Jon, sadly. \"I do not know how to remove the curse and the woman who placed it onto Danielle died as the curse works both ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By cursing your daughter, she cursed herself as well.\" I said, guessing. \"You've shrunken yourself to protect her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded. \"Through the years, I have protected her, unseen, so she would never feel threatened.\" he said. \"Only now, I'm too old and must pass the torch. I returned to normal size to create a batch of dust to shrink you down for the task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, not liking where Jon was going with his words. \"I want to raise a family with Danielle.\" I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still can.\" replied Jon, with a sigh. \"Just don't let her see you shrink or grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I up against here?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon shrugged. \"Demons as tall as you and I are right now.\" he said. \"Droves of them will attack Danielle at once, causing her to trip, become ill, anything to harm her or terrify her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds impossible.\" I stated. \"Anything in my favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon smiled. \"It's not impossible.\" he said. \"In your normal state, you will sense them coming and in your shrunken state, you will will be super human compared to your size as you keep your normal strength and speed.\" he paused. \"Are you interested or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I replied, \"Okay, I'm in.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other demon was even easier to distract.

She was oblivious to what is happening. She took long strides, crushing anything underneath her feet. As her foot lifted, we could see crumbs fall off her soles like debris from a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting much closer too quickly, there wasn't much that any of use could do... her gigantic left foot came over us, and then slowly came down like a crashing plane. Luckily we fit safely between the spacing in her toes, un-noticed. After Danielle had bored herself a rather large bowl of cheerios, she came back our way....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly i pushed the demons into harms way, and her foot squashed them into paste. As my beloved Danielle walked away I could see her sole slowly peeling off of the hard wood surface, and attached to her foot was the splattered remains of the tiny demons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I saw more of those little bastards! They were chasing Danielle, she was completely unaware of them us she sat down to partake in her delicious bowl of cereal....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to stop them, what was there plan now? So I ran over to her massive  chair and stared at her toes, they were the only way up, and I had to start climbing,,,, I just hope I don't get accidentally eaten...</span></div></div>",

Remembering the antidote Jon had given me and his instructions of how to use it, I took up a small bottle from my pocket. She can not see me grow or shrink, how can I do this?\" I asked myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting an idea, I ran forward and rammed the chair Danielle was in, causing it to suddenly move a few inches. This forced a low scream from Danielle which I used to quickly hit myself with the power inside the bottle, returning me to my normal size in seconds. \"Hey, honey, sorry if I startled you.\" I said, quickly taking her into my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, what!?!\" asked Danielle, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, dancing her around as she held onto her cereal bowl. She laughed with me, unaware that I was stomping the shit out of the little demons that had planned to do who knows what. \"I have some wonderful news, honey.\" I said, finally putting her down. \"I snagged a great job at the research company, just outside of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where dad worked before his disappeared.\" she said, sadly. \"I don't want that to happen to you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really not allowed to tell you this, but you deserve to know.\" I said, causing Danielle to become curious. \"Your dad was promoted and had been working undercover for the government, he was not allowed any ties with his family in fear that they may become targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of what I had said to Danielle was the truth, minus the government involvement but she accepted it, slowly nodding as she let out a low sigh. \"I thought it might have been along those lines.\" she said. \"How did you snag this job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad offered it to me.\" I replied. \"I may have to vanish on you from time to time as my job requires me to leave at a seconds notice but...\" I produced a gold coin that was worth nearly a thousand dollars and handed it to her. \"The pay is well worth the frustration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a Spanish deblume.\" she said, surprised. \"I had always wanted one to hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lightly kissed Danielle on the forehead. \"That is my gift to you.\" I said. \"All I ask is your patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spanish deblume came from a large stash inside the walls and under the floor that I had discovered before my shrinking adventure. I had not taken them out as I had planned to use them as a retirement nest egg. Danielle placed her bowl aside and stood up before pulling me into a hug. \"I think I can be a little patient.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience has its rewards, sweetie.\" said Jon's voice. Danielle and I turned to see Jon, back to his normal size. \"I'm sorry I was not there for you over the years but I have been watching over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, confirming his words. \"He has.\" I said. \"Remember that incident when the car went out of control on us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle nodded but did not speak and I added, \"Dad had it investigated and found that the auto repair shop that fixed the car, sabotages their own repairs to keep the customers coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They fell under a federal inspection that very same day.\" said Jon. \"Did you ever wonder why they went out of business after that incident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle smiled and hugged him warmly. \"I missed you, daddy.\" she said. \"I missed you too, sugar.\" said Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two shared a long over due embrace, I sensed that the demons were coming again and took advantage of the distraction to take a small bag from my other pocket and sprinkled wits contents onto me, becoming tiny once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like Rob was called to work.\" said Jon. \"I had the same problem only I was not as young as he.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle sighed. \"This is going to take some getting used to.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" I said, hearing her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Breaking free from the rest of the shit, you jumped up, just as Danielle stood up to wipe her rear and managed to scramble out of the toilet and made a bee line for the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone call 9-1-1, I've just been violated!\" you chuckled, quoting a comedy movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way into the shower, you saw Jon, shrunk to your size. He laughed, shaking his head,  then tossed you an antidote pouch. \"That will happen again if you're not careful.\" he said. \"I kept the little monsters at bay while you were touring my daughter's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, grateful and became normal sized to start your shower. Once you did, Danielle sniffed the air and made an unpleasant grunt. \"What is that smell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, honey.\" you said, inside the shower. \"I was given a rather disgusting assignment today, I had to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She patted her stomach, and she started to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back inside her stomach, rob could hear her started to sleep, and he feared that he might be digested with her stomach acid. Thinking too much, he lost the balance and stumbled down toward the pond, now mixed with the stomach acid. He got dumped inside the pond, and rob was panicking as if was going to get digested. He felt some stinging sensensation, and he quickly got out of the acid filled pond quickly. When he got out and got to the safer area, he saw his arm bruised with redness (might be the acid).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He now have a new option: will he now get her attention, or will he continue to explore?</span></div></div>",

At this time you should run away as far as you can because once I am done counting I'm ganna step on you! But don't worry though I will be barefoot for your enjoyment, but try not to get squished!  If you last 5 minutes I promise to take care of you. Now to make it fair, I promise not to look down at any time durring the game. Now i'll know if you lose because if I don't feel you squish under the bottom of my foot i'll check it in 5 minutes. Also if you win i'll let you play with my feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the next game is a little more simple. It's called Russian Roulette (cracker edition) Bassically in this game I count to 30 again with my eyes closed as you hide on one of three crackers. After I am done counting I will choose a cracker at rondom and ea tit in 2 bites! The reason why 2 bites is because if I some hoe pick the one you are on and I bite it the first time and miss you I want my gigantic teeth to fall right in front of you so you can stare at them and touch them one last time. Then of course I'm ganna eat you! And so you can enjoy it I won't look at the crackera at all durring the game and I am going to eat it in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it ganna be tiny Rob?

You thrash about in an attempt to snatch a little precious air for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waves of saliva abate, and you are left gasping against the surface of her tongue, drenched and covered in crumbs.

You are carried closer to it, as the tongue lifts and shifts you in preparing to consuming your tiny body. There's no escape for you.

Clean clothes, bright demeanor, and still had the little dimple on the side of his cheek. It was such a shame that Rob would end up dying before the day was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been nice knowing you, Rob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice knowing me? What do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?\" Rob shouted so Danielle could hear. Danielle replied as softly as she could, cautious not to harm her soon to be ex-boyfriend's eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. Listen Rob, I've grown bored of you. You never offer anything exciting. It's the same routine day in and day out. You never want to go anywhere, you never want to have any fun. You just want to sit in the house and carry on your monotonous behavior pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's ears perked up. When Danielle was done with her lecture, Rob immediately went on the defensive. \"You never told me that. I can change, baby. Really I can. Just tell me what you want and I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for that Rob, but before I kill you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill me!?\" Rob screamed. Danielle gave Rob a look before resuming. She hated being interrupted. \"Yes, kill you. I'll make sure you die peacefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the pleas from Rob to reconsider her decision, Danielle hovered Rob across her cleavage and dropped him in between the small space between her breasts. Rob tumbled downward below the soft vanilla fleshly mounds and hit the inside of the brassiere with a thud. Although he was happy where he was, he needed to get out and try to escape from his psychotic ex-girlfriend. However, before he could even begin to climb Danielle's well-endowed assets, the walls were pushed in from both sides of him. They did not crush him, but made his world uncomfortable. He could barely tell what was up and was down. His sense of direction was severely altered. Meanwhile Danielle was moaning in ecstasy as she crushed her ex between her big breasts. After thirty seconds of cruel and unusual punishment, Danielle took Rob out of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that, little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob gasped for breath before delivering the onslaught that would seal his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy bitch! You killed me! You know what? Fuck you! I'm glad you're breaking up with me. I don't fucking care if you want to do more stuff. I like my life. If you hate, go find someone else you ranch unworthy snobby little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle remained calm throughout the whole ordeal. When her miniscule ex was done, she merely blobbed him in her mouth and chewed as hard as she could. She could feel Rob's insides flush around her giant molars and around her teeth. Finally after savoring the taste of revenge, she gulped down the bloody corpse and smiled. Rob was no more and she couldn't have been happier to been freed from him.</span></div></div>",

The thieves were gearing up from the biggest heist of their lives. They were hired by a Scientific Company, a company called PrimeIon. The CEO believed that one of their employees, Danielle had stolen a secret product still in testing for her own services. The thieves were paid to conduct espionage and steal anything that may have looked peculiar. The CEO had given them everything they needed. Night vision goggles, a small device capable of shrinking things, and other equipment. There was a reason why they were the size of ants. The CEO of PrimeIon had insisted that every household that contained a employee contained a security system which would automatically alert everyone in the house that an intruder was inside. The security system worked in an odd way. It analyzed the heat signature of everyone in the house. If you were above one foot in height and your heat signature wasn't registered within the system, you were in big trouble. The CEO claimed that every PrimeIon employee was always at risk due to it being such an important corporation in the scientific world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thieves had the growth serum on them but they didn't plan to use until after the left the household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the thieves, we haven't introduced our trio have we? Let's do that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Logan. The eldest. A go-getter who took it upon himself to lead anything that was given to him. Needless to say, failure is not in his vocabulary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave. The middle one who took it upon himself to emulate Logan. Although he was far from being Logan himself, he could still hold his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles. The youngest one. A new recruit. Constantly asks questions and constantly has to be bailed out by Logan and Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio made their way into the kitchen, where they believed the prototype would be. As they made their way into the kitchen though, they heard a loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's past midnight,\" Screamed Logan. \"What does she doing up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight snack, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark kitchen instantly lit up. The small trio looked into the door of the kitchen. There they saw Danielle, in a very revealing black nightgown. She rubbed her eyes then walked into the kitchen, hoping to get something to eat for Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that a small trio of thieves were nearly smashed underneath her bare foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" Logan called as he rolled out of the way.

So what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle looked down, hoping hear a response, but Rob was already asleep. It looks like she was going to do this all alone. It was a shame that Rob would miss out on the action.</span></div></div>",

He kicked the ground, thinking that Danielle took him out as soon as he fell asleep. He knew he shouldn't have forced his fetishes on her. Oh well, he thought.

Not wanting to sleep on the ground, he crawled inside and fell asleep in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle had failed to find the thieves in her kitchen. She had looked all night. All night. Under every nook and cranny. Not just in the kitchen either. Everywhere. Her basement, her bathroom, even her own bedroom. No thieves. She knew they were gone for good when she opened her pantry and saw that the company prototype was gone. Too make matters worse, she had to go to work in an hour. So she quickly got upstairs, brushed her teeth, and took a quick shower and began putting on her Casual Friday clothes at the office. She had forgotten all about Rob. Morning fatigue and staying up all night looking for intruders in your house will do that to you. She slipped on her business casual pants, shirt, socks, and then, shoes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was jolted awake. His world was turned upside down. He knew that Danielle had picked up the shoe. He tried to crawl out, but was met with five giant toes staring him in the face. He quickly ran back to the edge of the shoe. Nowhere else to run. He saw the giant socked digits become closer and closer until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMPH!\" The toes were on top of him, wiggling with anticipation. Danielle tied her shoes up tight, grabbed her cellphone, key chain, walked out the door, locked it, opened her car door, started the engine and drove off, unbeknownst to her that her boyfriend was now trapped in her shoe.</span></div></div>",

Under every nook and cranny. Not just in the kitchen either. Everywhere. Her basement, her bathroom, even her own bedroom. No thieves. Exhausted from an extended night, she went back into the kitchen and poured a can of soup in a bowl and began to microwave it. She stood there looking at the spinning bowl in the darkness. It was a simple thing and she enjoyed it very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me,\" Logan shouted. He and his friend Dave were on the top of the fridge minutes away from completing their mission. They had climbed the fridge all night hoping to get to the pantry that was above it. However they couldn't open the pantry as Danielle was right below them and that of course would attract her attention. So instead the two just bid their time. Little did they know that they were on the door side of the fridge and not the bulky part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle waited for the microwave to go off. As soon as she did, she opened the fridge to look for some cheese to go along with her tomato soup. There wasn't any. She closed the door in dismay. Little did she know that the two thieves that she had been looking for the entire night were on top of the fridge and fell off as soon as she opened the door. Logan, in her cleavage, and Dave on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle took the hot bowl of soup out of the microwave and made her way to the table. She sat down causing Logan to fall off of her chest and into the soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Exclaimed his partner in crime, Dave. Dave ran over to Danielle, traversing the laminated surface, hoping to rescue his friend. He would scale the giantess and rescue Logan from certain death making him a hero throughout the ages! Well, at least for the rest of Logan's life. Dave reached the chair where Danielle was sitting and began to climb her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle swirled her soup around in disappointment that she had wasted the entire night searching for two thieves which were probably long gone. She took a spoonful of tomato soup and gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was swimming for his life. He was a horrible swimmer and thickness of the red fluid didn't help much. He saw an oncoming shadow and quickly ducked underneath to avoid the plastic spoon. He felt the soup above him disappear. He came back up for air and began doggy paddle around the edge of bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was halfway up Danielle's toes when he noticed how beautiful they were. They were well manicured, well groomed, well-taken care of, no bruises or blemishes. Nearly perfect. He completely forgot about saving his friend's life to become Hero of the Ages! and was now worried about becoming Massage of the Feet! Little did he know that the feet he was so mesmerized by would be his demised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was done. He was exhausted. He was ready to die. He didn't care if he drowned in the soup or if his body was ripped apart by the stomach acids bubbling away inside Danielle. He was tired of being an expert thief. He wanted to live a normal life. He always wanted that. Normalcy not in so much as a job, but for recreation. He wanted to go fishing. Go hiking. Sure being an expert thief took you around the world and back, but there was no time for your personal interests. Only the interests of the client. If he ever survived this, he was going to quit being a thief ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that day would only come in an alternate timeline. Danielle took one more spoonful of soup, of which Logan was in, and shoved it in her mouth. She swirled it around mouth, her tongue exploring every inch of it's Lycopersicum goodness. She felt a thick spot amidst the fluid. Thicker than usual. She thought it was just a rogue tomato that didn't get juiced all the way so she swallowed it anyway. The tomato soup drowned down into her esophagus and splattered into the stomach where Logan died peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang. Danielle got up. Dave's world was rocked. He fell off of Danielle's toes and saw that Danielle was about to get up. He began running for his life. Little did Dave know that he was the one who sealed his own fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave ran to the phone, borrowing signature move from his departed friend Miles a la not thinking, hoping that Danielle would not chase after him. She did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy footsteps got heavier. The bare feet were approaching his body at an alarming rate. He felt as if he had seen this before. In a movie of some sort. Or at least, a scene in a movie altered by his own mind. He ran faster and faster. It was no use. Danielle finally reached Dave's body and crushed him underneath her barefoot. Danielle answered the phone which was a call from her boss telling her to come in early. She happily obliged then began her daily routine an hour early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left the house she vowed that she would find the two renaming thieves. Little did she know that she had already killed both of them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danielle not only worked at PrimeIon she also worked at a clothing boutique. Clara's Closet was the name of the place and they sold every article clothing imaginable. Socks, shoes, shirts, pants, jeans, tuxes, coats, mittens, what have you. If it existed, they had it. They place was fairly big for a simple clothing store that wasn't attached to a mall. It had two stories and the general manger had recently cleared a deal to add an expansion to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway that's not why you're reading this. You want to see the giantess content. Well fine, we'll skip to that. Who needs plot and backstory anyway? &gt;.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after four hard interrupted hours of working, Danielle was free to take her lunch break. She always brought the same lunch. A sandwich, coleslaw, and a small thermos filled with lemonade. Little did she know that this lunch would have an extra element added to it. Shrunken people. What? You wanna know how they got their? Too bad. You didn't let me finish my backstory so I'm not going to explain how or why there's little people in her lunch. You're just going to have to use your Willing Suspension of Disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle opened her lunch and immediately took a bite into her sandwich. Three people were sloshed and tossed around her mouth along with lettuce, bread, tomatoes, and chicken salad. They screamed for their life. They pounded her teeth each time they got close enough, but alas it was too much. Danielle was nice enough to crush two of three before swallowing. The third was burned alive by Danielle's stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle began to scarf down the sandwich violently. Something about this sandwich tasted differently. She couldn't put her finger on it, however. She had used the same ingredients she had used for the past couple of years. She eventually ignored why this sandwich tasted better than the others and finished off strong, stuffing half the sandwich in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround twenty people were stuffed into her mouth as well. Violently chewed to bits. All but one of them. The solitary one fell out of Danielle's mouth due to it being to full and landed between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here,\" The woman screamed. She began to grab a hold of the fleshy wall which was her breast only to cause  Danielle to commit an involuntary reaction. She took her arm and smashed it against her breast, causing both of her breasts to collide crushing the poor unsuspecting woman. Before she died, the woman wondered what she did to deserve a fate as bad as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Danielle gulped down the lemonade. Little did she know that several people were swimming around the thin yellow liquid. Their pleas of mercy could not be heard. Those who were swept in the giant yellow tidal wave saw that there were people trapped between the giant white molars of Danielle's mouth. It truly was a madhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great meal!\" Danielle exclaimed as she closed her lunch box.</span></div></div>",

Danielle made a couple of sales, talked with her fellow employees, and just had an all around good time. She went home around 5:45. When she got home, she saw an unexpected visitor waiting for her in front of her locked door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rob's college teacher, Jennifer. The five foot, seven inch Irish woman had a worried look on her face. Her whole demeanor actually looked worried. Even the ponytail in the back of her head was sagging a bit. Danielle left her car and greeted her boyfriend's teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Danielle. It's nice to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise. What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Rob. Have you seen him? He hasn't shown up to class lately. Normally I wouldn't care what a student does, but Rob is special. He seems to have a bright future ahead of him and I don't want that future of his to die. So, have you heard anything from him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle thought it would be best to keep Rob's small stature a secret. There was no telling what Jennifer would do if she learned the truth. She regained her slouched composure and spoke with clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but how about you come in and talk for a bit. We don't hang out like we used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer checked her watch and looked back up at Danielle. \"I suppose I have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle found the key to her house and opened the door. Both she and Jennifer stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the two giantesses know that Rob was standing on the other side of the door, awaiting his girlfriend's return. When the door opened he looked up and ran for cover almost instantaneously. A giant high heel slammed down on the side of him. Danielle didn't put on high heels this morning when she left for work. He looked up and saw Jennifer, his college professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing here!?\" Yelled Rob to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I'll fix you up some tea and a small salad I have in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle led the college professor to the kitchen table where she sat down. Danielle opened her gray metallic fridge and poured the brown cool liquid into a cup. She then took out a small, unopened package of salad and placed it near Jennifer. She then opened the sink drawer next to the fridge and took out a small white plastic fork. Jennifer took the fork with grace. She soon began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me...what exactly do you see in Rob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jennifer began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob made his way to the kitchen, hoping to get Danielle or his teacher's attention. He saw them both sitting at the classical stylized wooden tabled that contrasted with the futuristic look of Danielle's kitchen. He sprinted across the white marble landscape to Jennifer's high heels. They were open toed so he did the first thing that popped into his mind. He tickled them...with no avail. His fingers were to small to be detected by the nerves in his teacher's toes. He did the next option. He began to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That really is interesting,\" Danielle exclaimed while leaning in intensely. Anything good about her boyfriend was always nice to hear. \"Please tell me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I could tell you the time he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob had made tremendous progress in the last couple of seconds. Jennifer's legs were silky smooth leading to favorable climbing conditions. He was all the way up to the thigh. He planned to get up to her nose where Jennifer could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious!? And he wasn't suspended for that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I suppose he should have been though. He caught a lucky break I guess. I think that's enough about, Rob. What about you Danielle. What do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I do nothing. Just work in a clothing store.\" Danielle answered sheepishly, glossing over the fact that she was a Super Scientist on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob had finally reached Jennifer's shoulder. As he climbed to reach Jennifer's face, he lost his balance and fell into the giant garden salad below him. Jennifer, not noticing a thing, stabbed a fork through the lettuce piece he was on and brought it to her mouth. She parted her pink voluptuous lips and bit off the piece of lettuce. Rob screamed for dear life, banging on anything he could find connected to his teacher's mouth, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally... </span></div></div>",

Rob marveled once again at his girlfriend's shapely legs, this time from his new ant-sized perspective. He scanned his new horizon. He was so helpless, standing on her lap. Just then another spritz of apple juice fell on him as his girlfriends enormous teeth pulverized the apple high above. <i>She is such a messy eater,</i> he smirked. Rob stared up at her breasts, jutting out from her stomach. He craned his neck in order to view her amazing height. It was a miracle she had chosen leggings to wear today; he didn't know how he would have fared against any other material, especially the ground far below. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Danielle swallowed with a surprisingly loud *gulp*, setting the apple core on a napkin that resided on the coffee table. She let out a long, dramatic sigh, crossing her legs (almost crushing him, if he hadn't jumped out of the way of her thigh coming directly on top of where he was standing). \"I wish Rob was here...\" Danielle's voice booms, inescapable overhead. It is soft and higher in pitch, just how you remember; yet it is certainly much much louder, and more powerful sounding to you at your new minuscule stature. \"I <i>hate </i>when he leaves in the morning without telling me...\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You notice a sultry tone to Danielle's monologue which starts to excite you. She plays with her hair a bit and checks her phone- THAT'S IT! You still have your phone! It's in your pocket! You can be saved! But wait... your story isn't at all believable. You could send her a text, or call her, and just as soon be squished by a skeptical girlfriend thinking you're playing a prank. On the other hand, you have a vantage point. You have the power to communicate with your girlfriend without her even knowing you're there.</span></div></div>",

She <i>is</i> horny, so why not play around a little bit? You pull your pants down a little, exposing your boner. You snap a pic and send it to her along with the caption \"he misses you! (; \". An amazingly loud chime sounds, coming from Danielle's hand. Her notification tone. <i>Ting ting tong.</i> Her thumbs move high above, then she giggles. \"He's such a dork\" she says aloud. She stares at her phone with determination. Even if you <i>are</i> the size of an ant, you can't help but feel a surge of masculinity as she eyes you up on her phone. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just then your legs give way as her weight shifts. Her legs start to spread and you drop to all fours, your phone slipping from your grip. It slides down the gentle slope of her silky thigh before careening down, ending up out of sight. <i>Shit!</i> You are about to panic until you realize why Danielle jerked so suddenly. She is sitting on the couch, legs spread. From her left, you look into the distance. Her right leg must be hundreds of feet away. Your gaze continues until it reaches her most sensitive parts. Her once delicate hands, now alabaster towers, massaging her enormous camel toe, pulsing through the leggings. You feel her legs tense and then release multiple times as her breathing intensifies. <i>It's amazing to think.... to think that I caused this!</i> You start to smell her womanhood as she lets out a soft sigh. <i>\"Ungh.....Rob...\"</i> Her voice booms. Her fingers move with additional vigor, pressing now deeper into the fold in her leggings. The air around you becomes warm and humid. You marvel at how Danielle's mere emotions can change your entire climate. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Oh God... Now I've done it.

Before you can start talking you hear a tone reverberating through the phone. It grows steadily louder until it is louder than even Danielle's voice. \"Babe?\" her sweet voice cuts through the obnoxious tone. You quickly hang up the phone. <i>Damn feedback...

She is getting up! You find it hard to run on her smooth leggings; soon your sprint turns into a tumble and you fall the long distance down to the couch as Danielle ascends into the heavens. You collect yourself in time to look forward, observing the monolithic structures that are her legs before you. Your head tilts upwards and you are met with a view you could only describe as magical. Danielle's ass hangs high in the sky as she decides what to do. Her thighs and cheeks are squeezed by the leggings, providing a perfect outline of a perfect butt. She lets out another hum, swaying her hips as she places her finger on her chin. As she does so her cheeks seem to jiggle in slow motion. You wipe the sweat from your forehead. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess I shouldn't worry.\" Danielle is fond of talking to herself. She stretches her arms high in the sky, yawning, and to your sheer horror, her ass descends to your position. It begins by slowly getting transitionally larger, the closer it comes. Then the light from the sky is mostly blocked out. The last few inches are a freefall. You turn at the last minute for your face to be met by your girlfriends massive all-encompassing ass. It sinks deep into the couch, the equivalent of about a hundred feet for you. It doesn't hurt so much as it paralyzes. You cannot move a single muscle. The air is forced out of your lungs. Your tiny diaphragm couldn't <i>hope </i>to stand up to the weight of the Goddess known as Danielle. And so, that is how you die, the last thing you feel is the vibration of Danielle's sweet voice. \"I wonder what was so important Rob had to leave...\" Irony? Or is this the happy ending you would have wanted? Would you have hoped she would notice you? A miserable speck who could barely compare to an ant? Maybe it's easier this way, being snuffed out by Danielle's right butt cheek instead of hoping to compare to something in a world of giants. A fitting end; to be destroyed by someone so dear, while you were so tiny, she didn't even know she was doing it.</span></div></div>",

The pets in my breasts must massage, the ones in my panties must massage, and the ones in the socks must survive when they aren't massaging. When I go to bed you shall put softening lotion on my breasts, massage, and do my nails. It's easiest for each group to do the ones closest except that the hand nails should be a rotation.

She needed to get ready for work and was running out of time she even carried her womans blazer, blouse, skirt  nylons panties and bra from the master bedroom. This other spare room you were in was one that she had decorated for a little girl as you both planned on having childeren and she wanted a daughter so bad. The room was pink with white and pink furniture, stuffed animals pink fluffy carpet rugs and a child size bed with pink and white satin sheets and matching satin comforter and pillow cases, a white crib was also on the other side of the room. packages of baby and toddler clothes brand new some still packaged were piled on the bottom of the bed, little packages of socks underwear shirts pants skirts ect. she was very serious about having a daughter with you, you would even joke to her what if its a boy, she would reply well if thats the case you will have a foot ball team if means me getting one daughter. you cringe at that thought as you stare at all what was amassed under this childrens sized bed.  Lots of Barbie dolls and doll houses, toy cars, planes, RV's, and more, there was so much Pink Barbie in this room it would give you virtigo if you looked at the colors to long.

However, from his college days, he was really sporty guy but now he only plays sports every now and then so this shouldn't be so bad.

While sitting down, he could not help but look up to the towering figure of his girlfriend. By her long legs alone, it already looks like a tall skyscraper from his point of view. But if you would include her full height, she's like a mountain. This surely is because Danielle is tall for a girl. She is 5'10.

As idea after idea floated into her mind, she became excited.  Not knowing where Rob was contributed to arousing feelings of coyly playing hard to get.  For a few moments, she thought that Rob could be purposefully denying her attention as a form of foreplay.  Eventually, her thoughts took a life of their own and she lost interest in the box.  Now hugging the box which was full of possibilities and opportunities, she begrudgingly in a thoughtful and deliberate manner, placed it on the floor.  She made an unconscious look to see if anyone were around, then returned to her warm spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she felt that Rob was too tardy, even for his usual, she began to shows more concern.

Then he felt like an 18 wheeler truck slammed into his body and he screamed in pure agony as he felt both of his legs break under the pressure of Sammy's foot.

It started out as a small bright white light that was nothing when compared to the light of the sun. But as the day went on, it grew and grew it. The bright light slowly transformed into a cloud. The cloud then began to swirl around, growing in circumference every time in completed a cycle. It blocked out the sun. Wind speeds picked up. Meteorologists and Scientists alike were stunned. They had never seen weather such as this. Suddenly, the cloud began spinning rapidly, completing twenty cycles in a matter of five seconds. Wind speeds picked up. They shifted directions rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the unthinkable happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the men were sucked up into the cloud at great speeds. It was as if the cloud was an alien spacecraft deploying it's tractor beam, sucking up any unfortunate people caught in it's ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of the men were caught the cloud vanished in an instant. There were no signs of what just happened other than the destruction the wind caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the lack of men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the men know that they would be telereported into a small house far outside New York City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they would be all the size of Peas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle made her way through the kitchen. Little did she know that several little people were on the floor of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked up at the giant woman stomping through what they believed the kitchen. Many men ran for their lives, but several stayed in place. The woman was wearing what could be considered a two piece bikini. They were so mezmerized by the sight that they didn't notice the giant foot step on.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSPLASH! SQUASH! CRUSH!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle had crushed three unsuspecting men underneath her feet and she didn't even know it. She opened the drawer that was located above her fridge and pulled out a cup. Several tines were inside the cup. She then opened the fridge up and grabbed the nearest soda can. She opened in and poured the caffeinated drink into the red plastic cup. The little men inside were flushed with a torrent of clear sugary liquid splashing down above them. Luckily most of them could swim. Danielle put the soda back in the fridge and went back up stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLASH! SQUASH CRUSH!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crushed three more men underneath her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men were standing on a vast leathery surface. They were rather confused by what was going on. One minute they were discussing business negotiations outside, the next they found themselves next to a giant unaware woman in nothing but her underwear watching Star Wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a day.\" One man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right. Tomorrow I'm calling the boss. I want the week off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seat is getting stiff. I'm sure Danielle won't mind switching seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman that was sitting to next to the small men got up and made her way to the other side of the couch. She began to bend down. The two giant men screamed as the giant ass came near them. One tried to jump off the couch, but was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men were squished underneath Danielle's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLOTCH!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back.\" Danielle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle then sat on the couch and handed Sammy the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm parched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy then brought the red plastic cup up to her lips and began drinking. The small men inside began swimming in the opposite direction for dear life. The current, however, was just too overwhelming. Sammy had drunken several men to go along with her soft drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle grabbed a potato chip from off the table and placed in it dip. Little did she know that she had scooped a tiny men to go along with it. She brought it the chip up to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no! Please God I'm sorry. I'll do anything.

He jumped up and screamed doing anything to get the attention for the giant woman holding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy then proceeded bring the chip to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowed down for the man. The eye staring at him left his vision and was replaced by a giant mouth. The lips opened up to reveal a cavernous hole that contained a soft pink slippery serpent like object. At the very back was a throbbing punching bag like object. The tongue and uvula respectively. The chip he was on began to enter the mouth. He screamed for dear life, running away trying to escape certain death. He was too slow. Sammy jammed the snack food into her mouth and began to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was tossed back and forth, up and down, and all around. He became mixed with various ingredients floating around in Sammy's mouth, especially the saliva. Finally, Sammy swallowed everything in her mouth, including the man who screamed all the way down her esophagus and continued to scream until her stomach acids ripped him apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Danielle. Put that on pause. I want to show you something.\" Sammy got up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle put the movie on pause and got up. Danielle then led Sammy into the nearest bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are getting up!\" A tiny formerly homeless man called to his peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men in the carpet began screaming as giant bare feet began pounding on the all sides of them. Their giant legs were so tall they looked as if they could the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SQUISH! SLAM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle's and Sammy's giant foot slammed against the soft carpet crushing several men underneath her bare feet. On the way to the bathroom, Danielle stopped Sammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sammy. Look at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle pointed to the ground and saw a giant bug. It was actually a sumo wrestler in New York City for the international tournament, but the two girls didn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle raised her giant bare foot and lowered on top of the sumo wrestler. Before she crushed the poor unsuspecting man, she got an idea. She lifted her foot off of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sammy. Eat it. I dare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy, being the daring young girl, picked up the sumo man in-between her fingers. She then brought him up to her lips and-stopped. This wasn't a bug! It was a tiny human and he was signalling to her! She brought the sumo wrestler to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me. I am human being. There are many other human beings in this very house. I don't know how to explain what happened, but every male of New York City is in your home the size of a pea. You've been killing hundreds. Please spare my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...no.\" Sammy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSammy then placed the sumo wrestler into her mouth and began sucking on his fat folds making sure to absorb every last flavor before gulping him down like the tasty treat he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle,\" Sammy began. \"I have figured out something better.\"             </span></div></div>",
