As guys playing as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, Samus Aran in Metroid, Rubi Malone in WET, Claire Redfield in Resident Evil, Kate Walker in Syberia,  and Faith Conners in Mirror's Edge, we had the ability to momentarily become the focal character, imagine we were in their bodies as they traverse their respectable universes, and to a select few, wonder what it would be like to really be that person. To be a person who was in comparison to ourselves, weaker, though come out on top as an underdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen games came out with the ability to create your own character, we chose to divert from the norm and instead of playing with male avatars, we chose to create female avatars. In the games of Defiance, World of Warcraft, Mass Effect, Grand Theft Auto Online, and many more, we chose avatars that when seen in the virtual world, would seem weak and pathetic and watch how the tables are turned when we bring the house down, sometimes literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat game am I playing?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had just got the game when it came out for the next-gen console. Got so excited to play it that I just popped it in and waited for the installation to finish. But once it was complete, it was on from there. I activated the game and waited for it to load. I had to play in first-person, which was a nifty addition to the playthroughs. First mission was weird in first-person perspective, and I felt like a newbie, even though online, I was a seasoned veteran. The story mode wasn't new, since I did play through it twice just for the fun of it, but online was where the fun was. It wasn't predictable like the story mode. At any given moment, you could die from someone wielding an assault rifle, doing a driveby down the main thoroughfare, griefing all the other players in the session. Of course, you would respawn nearby, but that's how crazy it could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all introductions were over, I brought the character select hub up and changed to online mode. Since I was a returning player, I had the option of transferring my character from the old-gen console to the new-gen console. They even offered me to edit my character a bit, but everything I saw was perfect. With the new graphics, my female avatar from the old-gen had a new, revamped-look, but was familiar to me. Dressed in a navy tank top with tan short shorts, accessorized with a black pearl necklace and matching pearl bracelet and a silver watch, black and purple running shoes, aviator sunglasses, brown hair fashioned in a ponytail and my tan skin inked with various tattoos, this was me in the virtual world of Los Santos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey even gave me a criminal mugshot too. Sort of a souvenir from prison before getting released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen faded to black, but that's when things went weird. I didn't feel like I was watching the screen which showed a wide view of Los Santos from several feet up in the air, a bird's eye view, in the comfort of my living room. My hands didn't feel like they were holding a controller either. Wind blew past me, but not enough to move me. It was as if I was floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the moment, I wasn't. I was like teleporting. First I was thousands of feet up in the air. The next moment I was half that height. Next, a couple of hundred up in the air, above the property where I had my in-game apartment in. All of these teleportation done without the sensation of moving. I didn't move at all. The wind blowing past me did not change in speed. The next moment, my vision faded, but then I... opened my eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt like I was standing, but my body felt different. I was looking at a view of a certain room of my apartment, which I remember was the last view I saw after logging out on the old-gen console. But what was going on? Graphics were different too. Less of a new-gen graphic done on a computer. What I was seeing was... real? Textures weren't made of shapes done in a 3-D program, but they felt life-like, like I could reach out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" I speak, but when I do, it's not my deep male voice. It's that of a woman. I speak due to my eyes seeing in first-person my dominant arm. It was like my real arm, textured in real, hairless skin with the same tattoo I had on my female avatar. The voice was actually the second thing that surprised me and when it did, I lifted my other arm to put a hand on my lips, a common gesture when you say something unexpected. But when I did, what I felt was totally unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fingers were smaller than a man's fingers and they had touched upon soft lips. If I recall, my lips were rarely pristine and chapped all the time. These lips were soft, tender and seemed to have a slippery... whatever on it. It wasn't saliva, if that's what you are thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial sensations, a flood of other came by fast. A phone vibrated and signaled to me a notification. It vibrated inside the pocket of my pants. I look down to check, but find that the rest of my body was different. Black and purple running shoes, tan short shorts, navy blue tank, black-pearl necklace and matching bracelet, various tattoos on my arms and legs... I walked into the bathroom that sat next the nightstand that sat next to the bed. Once I walked in and saw a woman in the mirror, wearing the same things I was wearing, I almost lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands, as if they had a mind of their own, touched places that were indeed familiar to see in third-person, but were awfully weird, yet surreal when done in first-person. Breasts, a bit larger than the old-gen version of my avatar, protruded out of my chest and lifted the navy blue tank top I was wearing, creating a nice cleavage as I looked down on them. Also, my short shorts tell me that I no longer have what I know I had in the real world between my legs. All of my expression can be seen on the face of the woman in the mirror. That woman is me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk out and sit on the bed, feeling it's softness and comfort, not like it's old-gen counterpart that looked like a block of pixels in the last version of the game. The room around me is not virtual, but very real. Almost identical to the one I bought with almost half a million GTA$ months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could sit here all day, just in wonder of the room around me, but I know there is a vast world outside waiting for me to explore it. What should I do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In this particular game, I've gotten all my fun moments out of racing and tuning cars, so the idea pops into my mind. I have a garage with ten cars in it. I so have to see how they in these eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk out of the bedroom, discovering the main living area beyond it, but mind is focused on getting to the garage, which I have to round not one but two corner to get to the door. Once at the front door, I find a small hallway with a single elevator and five other doors that lead to other apartments. I call the elevator, which at once opens for me to get inside. I ride the lift down until it stops at a basement level. When the doors open, all the cars I had once I logged out with the old-generation console sits before me in a white-floor, white-ceiling garage, but in this what I would can future-gen graphics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst car before me is my matte olive drab Dominator, which is style to look like a modern Ford Mustang. The wheels are especially great, since though in olive green, the rim style is like that of Ken Block's Mustang in his latest Gymkhana video. Since Los Santos is like Los Angeles, I believe it fits well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the garage sits a unique-blue Ubermacht Sentinel XS, which is modeled to be like a BMW. The tuner wheels I have on there are called Gruppe Z and they have a gold spoke insert with a chrome lip. The tires as well have decals on the sidewalls. The car itself has a aftermarket body kit as well as an interior roll cage and a carbon fiber spoiler on the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to the Sentinel XS, sits a silver Vulcar Warrener, a four-door sedan, styled to be like an old-school four-door Skyline. The rims are the same as the Sentinel, but instead of gold inserts, there is black inserts and the sidewalls of the tires are blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite side of the garage, next to the Dominator, sits my newly acquired Hotknife, a hot rod of sorts that looks to be a Ford model. The car is tuned with muscle car wheels with wide drag tires. Just looking through the window, I find the style is pristine, as if it rolled out of a hot rod shop today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the Hotknife is a sports car, called the Massacro, which is styled like a Ferrari. I have it in a ice white paintjob with sports rims in red. Unlike the Sentinel, this has a minimalist theme with the body kit. Everything except the rear diffuser, fender vents, roof scoop, and carbon fiber hood, is kept stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from the Massacro is one of two coupe-class cars I have in my garage. Even though it's in the coupe class, this particular car is a sedan. Decked out in all-black, including the rims, is my Felon. Sitting next to that is the Felon GT, the same kind of car, but only two doors and the roof is convertible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to the Massacro is my favorite, which came free due to me having a membership with Social Club. Style to be like a modern GTR, my Elegy RH8 is dressed in Torino Red with the secondary being all chrome. The pieces that come in chrome is the side skirts, rear bumper (diffuser canards are kept carbon fiber), and my mirrors. The hood and roof plus the GT Wing come in carbon fiber as well. The interior is customized with more carbon fiber panels as well as a red-painted roll cage. The car sits on tuner rims in a dark copper colors with white decals on the sidewalls of the tires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the Elegy is my only super car, which is the Turismo R. It is painted yellow and matte blue for the secondary around the cockpit and for the side vent near the rear wheels. The wheels are painted in navy-blue and like all my tuner wheel, I add the customized decals on the sidewalls. This super car also has a GT wing on the rear of the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, my most recently purchased vehicle is a Khamelion, an electric sports cars that has a plethora of inspirations in its design. I styled the car to the colors in the cockpit, but only found that it only have one paintjob for it. I could only color it one color. So white is what I painted it in, but to offset all the white, I made the roof plus the hood of the car to be made of carbon fiber. I also put gold colored inserts in the muscle car rims and also added a carbon fiber spoiler to the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at all these rides is a trip, since I'm not seeing computer-generated graphics, but all the cars seem real. The feel real from the touch of them and the reflections are spot on. I don't even think I'm in the game itself. It seems like this is all a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to have these cars sit idle would be a waste of my hard-earned money. I should take one out for a spin. But which of these ten should I pick?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I ultimately decide on the Warrener, which isn't that fast to begin with, but it sure is a nice car to drive if out on leisure. I go for the driver's side door, but find it locked when I pull on the handle. How could it be locked? If this is my car, then surely I shouldn't be hotwiring it every time to start. Since this is a new world where i'm seeing everything through my eyes and touching everything and sensing everything with my body, there are things that must be done just like the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find the corner where a laptop and radio sit. The radio pumps music from Worldwide FM, a sort of international electronic dance music radio station that has elements of jazz infused with dance music. I can't really put a finger on what genre it is. I check the cabines and discover that all of them open. They are not just for decoration anymore. I find one that has a board with ten hooks embedded into it. A total of ten keys hang from the hooks, all with different keychains and tags that show the name of the car the key is supposed to be used on. Not to mention that every key has the weight of a key and has the respective insignia or logo engraved into the plastic of the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find one with the Vulcar symbol and a tag that has the make and model name Warrener on it. I take it out its hook and walk back to the car. A remote unlocks the car with a push of a button and I'm able to open the door and get in. Everything I've done in the old-gen game is still in the car and the interior is exquisite to see. The roll bars, painted in the same primary silver, line the ceiling and cross at the rear of the car, making the chassis more rigid. Features that us players didn't see in the old game was the dashboard, which is black with wood grain surrounding the dials, radio and even the steering wheel, all with the proper insignias. Also, what deserves mention is the ignition. I take the key and insert into the ignition and turn it to the first setting. This turns on the radio as well as a digital clock situated to the left of two A/C vents. The radio plays the same radio station I have in my garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the key to the next notch turns on the auxilary systems. The A/C blows cools air out the vents, which is a really amazing sensation as it blows against my skin. It's so surreal, I can somehow forget that this is a game. Turning the key to the next notch activates the startup and the spark plugs and seconds after holding it at the notch, the engine turns over. The roar of a tuner engine as well as the hum is satisfying to hear, much more better than the last game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice a man in my garage, coming out of the back room dressed in a boiler suit of some kind. He jogs to the middle between two doors and he presses a switch that opens one of the doors. I put the car in gear and drive towards the open door, though glancing at the man as I exit. He gives me a smile and a wave and closes the door as I'm completely out of the garage and through the door. The space outside the door isn't a driveway that goes to another, bigger door, but some type of hallway or roadway that connects to other garages, all with two doors. I follow signs and arrows on the roadway that lead me up to a familiar door which opens once it senses that there is a car nearby. The door rises and allows me to pass underneath it. The door reveals the city behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm in wonder of everything around me, but I pay attention to my driving so as not to hit a car parked in the nearly full lot outside the door. I turn left onto the ramp that leads to the street. Once there, I get a glimpse on how large a living, breathing, thriving city like Los Santos is. Where should I go?</span></div></div>",

I assume it's Simeon with his list of cars, but when I pull the phone out of my pocket, I find that Simeon's text was sent yesterday. If I recall, I didn't even play the game, since I had sold it to the game store in order to get the current generation game and console that day. The new message is from a number with no name attached to it, meaning it's not in my contacts list. I open the message and it reads: \"Head to this place.\" A picture of a familiar barn in the countryside is shown underneath the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring this could be something new in the game and that nothing bad ever happens from a video game, I decide to follow the instructions and make my way to the barn shown in the picture. I put my phone into one of the cup holders and put the car in drive. I pull out of the car, heading right onto the street and immediately into a tunnel. The tunnel leads me out to a street that when taking a left turn onto it, becomes a highway. I drive up the highway for about a mile or mile and a half or so before exiting on an off-ramp, which sits more or less next to the Los Santos Casino and Racetrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the light, I turn left and after driving on the street, I take a right at a stop sign. I'm on a street that leads to the countryside. I pass by a house owned by Martin Madrazo. The next turn is onto a dirt road that passes by what looks like a minor ranch with no name. From there, I make a right and left onto more dirt roads before I get to my destination. In this world with real-life graphics, the barn looked more abandoned, as if it had been set ablaze and quickly doused to create the black-wood-burn-effect. In the last game, though, it did not have doors and was open and lit by whatever light there was to illuminate the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI park my car outside and get out. Out here in the country, it's considerably warmer, but fortunately there is a cool breeze to relieve the heat off of my bare skin. I approach the door and look around. Whoever sent me that text must be either late or not even here. I figure the only place he, or even she, could be would be inside the barn. I pull on the handle on the door and to my surprise, it's not locked. I pull it enough so that I can slip inside unscathed. In the dark of the barn, i call out, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a swift strike to the back of my neck knocks me out cold and the last sensation I feel is falling onto my side on the dusty ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up with a throbbing pain at the base of my neck. I try to move, but for some reason, when I do, I get a swinging motion. I'm immediately alerted to the pivoting point where my hands are tied together and hanging from an unseen ceiling. I cannot see and I find that there is a blindfold over my eyes. I try to grunt and scream, but I discover that my mouth is taped up and something is inserted into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's awake,\" a male voice says. Judging from the echo his voice makes, I figure we are not in the barn in the countryside. Someone must have knocked me out once I got inside that place. They must have taken me to someplace that is has not air-conditioning. It feels like we are in a huge metal box in the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear footsteps behind me and rough hands untie the blindfold over my eyes. Blinding light from large lamps directly in front of me cause me to squint and look away. They subsequently dimmed and as my eyes adjust, I see before me...?</span></div></div>",

Instead there is a real doorknob and a door that opens one way. Even the hinges are spot on. The next room I walk into is the main living area. Since this apartment was from the latest update on the old-gen, it's much more newer, yet much more better-looking in this real world. The textures, whatever it may be, is life-like, like how it would reflect light and how it would feel when I feel it with my hands. Leather has the feel of leather. Wood, though fake, has the texture of treated wood. But it's not the furniture or the household items that catch my attention. large window that gives me a panoramic view of Rockford Hills and Vinewood Hills. counterparts of Beverly Hills and the Hollywood Hills respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery seems more alive, as if I'm definitely in a living, breathing, functioning city. Below my view is the highway that cuts through this section of town. Usually, the traffic would be moderate, but in this world, there is a traffic jam. On a clock I read the time is around 7 or 8 in the morning, so this is the AM rush hour. The traffic is backed up to the next exit while in the other side of the highway, cars are zipping past with no care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat blows my mind is the activity happening across the way. In the old-generation game, the construction site across from my apartment building and on the other side of the highway, there was hardly any activity. I mean construction workers on each level of the building's frame, construction equipment being used, vehicles driving in a out of the lot, and the sounds a site like this makes. In this living, breathing, world that's like the real world I live in, all of that activity is happening. More so, the cranes that are just meant for decoration or obstacles to planes and helicopters, lift steel beams from the ground to welders and riveters several stories up. I just wonder: will this building ever get finished and block my view of the hills behind it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen looking up, I see planes lifting up higher into the sky, leaving the white cloudy contrails behind them. Birds flap their wings and glide in between buildings. Even pigeons land on lamp post and visibly crap white poop on unsuspecting pedestrians on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I'm taking in this rather busy view, something vibrates my right ass cheek. My hand hovers over the back pocket of my shorts and when I press my palm against my ass, my hand vibrates due to a blocky source that's within the pocket. I pull out the object and find a phone, which rings once more. There is an unknown number on the caller ID. I press the green phone icon and slide it to the right to answer it. \"Hello?\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the person on the other line?</span></div></div>",

When I pull it out, it looks to be a Android phone, but in this game, it's called a Drone, a pun on the real-world counterpart. I unlock it and see a familiar home screen and familiar icons. On the top, in the very center of three icons, is an envelope for text messages. Up to this point, I only have one text message from a familiar name. Simeon. Mr. Yatarian. Claims to be a international business, but in truth, sells cars out of his dealership with weekly payment plans that could do more than burn a hole in one's pocket. His text message is the common one, where he has a list of cars that need to be boosted, resprayed in a different color and delivered to a garage at the docks. What's different is the cars I see on the list is not the common cars us players see driving on the streets of Los Santos, but these are cars that us players know have tracking devices on them. Was this in the new update? Was playing in our actually avatars included in the update as well? Rockstar has a lot to answer for if this ever gets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I peruse through the list, the phone vibrates again and I close the message only to find another one in my inbox. This time, it's from a friend, someone who plays as a guy and is a guy in real life. He already knows of my playstyle and we have done this game together in a few sessions before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message reads: \"Hey dude, saw you were online. This fucking shit that's happening is crazy. Can I come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply: \"Sure. I think I'll have to buzz you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk out of the room and into the main area of my apartment. Instead of seeing new-gen graphics, I see real-world graphics on everything. Everything in the living room, in the kitchen and even outside too. Outside of the window there world is much more vibrant with real sounds and natural textures and don't forget about the weather. The sun shines high in the sky, brightening Los Santos several stories below. The highway and streets are filled with cars, something that was promised with next-gen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the buzzer sounds. I see a panel in the wall near the refrigerator that wasn't there in the last version. It's where the buzzer sound is coming from. I pick up the phone and a video feed of a familiar face shows up on the screen. I don't say anything and just push a button to open the door. I hook the phone and watch the door open. My friend's avatar walks in, his eyes wide with amazement and once he sees me, his jaw drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're...\" he starts, but is at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl,\" I say with my higher-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're... smoking hot,\" he says and proceed to poke at my breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel his poke and as a natural reaction, I deliver a hard slap to his cheek. What does he do in response?</span></div></div>",

His happy demeanor changes to one akin to a predator with his prey in his sights. In quick succession, he reaches his hand to grab my throat and then pins me to the wall. I try with all my power to use my hands to get his arm off me, but it's no use. Somehow the game reminds me that even though my skills are maxed out, my strength is only at 40%. My friend's hand doesn't choke me, but due to its longer length, it's used to keep me out of reach of retaliating or defending myself from what he does next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no power to stop his other hand from reaching over to my tank top and pulling the collar down to reveal and expose one of my breasts. In the moment, I find the size is definitely much larger than the old version of my avatar. If I could compare, it's definitely large and softer than a navel orange, but it's definitely smaller than a grapefruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same hand drops to unbutton my short shorts and unzip the zipper. He inserts his hand under the fabric and touch upon a very sensitive area. I groan at the unfamiliar sensation and I panic. I reach from behind me, thinking about a pistol, and pull out a platinum-plated Heavy Pistol. I lift it up with the 40% strength in my arm and pull the trigger. With my 40% strength, I'm able to keep it steady, even as it blows back in recoil. The end result is the bullet entering my friend's forehead with such force that he is knocked back in a shower of red. The splatter sprays at my face and onto my shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend falls to the floor in a blood-curdling thud on the hardwood floor. His head has a gaping and bloody hole and I can barely recognize him as a pool of blood widens underneath him. I look then to the gun in my hand. The very same I customized in the last game. Platinum-plated, with an extended magazine and no sight or suppressor. Seeing how much power it has first-hand, I holster it by putting it behind my back. The gun leaves my hand and when I pull it out again, all I see is blood on my hand from the altercation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA text message again is sent to my phone, vibrating my butt cheek once more. The message reads: \"Sorry about that dude. I just saw your hot body and something primal within me just... happened. Can you open the door again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply: \"And watch you try to molest me? I don't think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis next text reads: \"I promise I won't do anything brash like that. I learned my lesson when you pulled out your gun. Dying in this game is no joke. Please, can you open the door again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply back: \"I'll be watching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buzzer sounds again and I again go over to the panel to buzz my friend back in. I don't do it right away, maybe because when I pick up the phone, I find that the blood is still on my clothes and body. When I try to look at where the corpse of my friend is, all I see is a pool of blood and the blood splatters from the bullet entering and exiting his head. It's only when I see nothing but blood that I push the button to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend comes in, dressed as he was before, but instead with clean clothes and a nifty bandage around his head. A bloody bandage at that. Just to make sure, I pull out my Assault Rifle and point it at my friend. As if he was busted after being Wasted, he puts his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't shoot. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking,\" my friend says. After a while, and a second just to think, I put away my rifle. \"Damn. Physics, blood, our body power, everything is just so life-like now. And shit, you are soaked in... well, my blood. You wanna take a shower and change first? I'll just wait out here and see if I can clean up this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" I say. I then walk back into the room, and straight into the shower. Before that, I make sure to lock the door to the room and luckily, in this real-life version, I can. No more door that swing both ways anymore. I'm starting to like this version of Los Santos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does my friend and I do when I'm done with my shower?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time I get into the shower, I start to smell the stink of the blood on my clothes. I toss them into a hamper that didn't seem like it was there before in the old game. Like that panel that buzzed people in, this hamper is a nifty new addition. Once naked, I glance at myself in the mirror. In the old game, due to censorship, when taking a shower, the only garments you have on were bikini tops and bottoms for female avatar. In this real life version, even the undergarments are real and not part of the skin. I enter into the warm water of the shower, relieved that the mess I made that happened to spray onto me is washing off, spiraling down the drain. Another addition, it seems, is body wash and shampoo sitting on the shower's shelf. I use both to clean my body, noticing that they make me feel cleaner. Not to mention that with this new body comes new sensations, especially if running my hands on my breasts and along that void between my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rinsing, I climb out of the shower. I take a towel from the rack, which used to be just decorative pixels in the last version and wrap it around my naked body. Everything feel so surreal as I wrap the towel over my breasts and not just my waist. In the mirror, I look mighty sexy in just a towel with a wet body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk out into the room and straight into the walk-in closet. Unusually, the familiar assortment of clothes from the last game, which, like the towel, was just decorative pixels and polygons, are gone from the shelves and hanger rods. Instead, all the clothes that I purchased are neatly put away on either hangers or on the shelves. Even the peculiar garments from themed DLC's are put on the top shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look for undergarments and find a lacy pair that I don't believe were obtainable in the last version. I fasten the bra on, nothing how they push up and support my breasts, and slide the panty, which is actually a thong, up my legs to hug along my crotch and in between my ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor outerwear, to prevent my friend from being distracted, I put on a combat sweater in a forest green color. I also put on matching gloves on my hands. The sweater and gloves both provide both warmth and protection. For pants, I put on a baggy pair of off-white chinos, which comes with a black web belt. For my feet, I put on a pair of black canvas sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my outfit done, I unlock the door and walk out. I find my friend on his knees, wiping with a damp cloth the remaining stains of blood from the floor. He has also taken the opportunity to wipe the splatter from everything it sprayed on. Almost magically, the hole that the high caliber bullet from my gun made after exiting my friend's skull is also plugged with a good amount of bondo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cleaned it up?\" I ask. \"How did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just took a towel from underneath the sink and wet it with water. I didn't need soap or chemicals. It just allowed me to erase it. That hole in the wall also plugged itself as I was cleaning the same wall. Same thing. Just a cloth and water,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. thanks,\" I say. \"Sorry for blasting you head wide open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my bad really. I got lost in the moment. Good thing you had that gun. Weird, the game lets you do things that weren't allowed or possible in the last game,\" he says after apologizing and taking the blame. \"I don't think this is even possible in the next-gen game though. Nothing this realistic. Plus, we're playing as outselves. I had two other characters, but this is the one I last used. Sucks. I had all my nice cars on my second character. I'm sort of a newbie as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you change?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already tried or don't know how to try. If I could find out, I would, but right now, I'm just surprised by everything that's happened so far,\" he says. \"Say, you only have one character right? High-level, lots of money, nice cars in particular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on almost everything, not a lot of money though, just a few thousand,\" I say. \"I kinda blew a lot of it on my cars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew you were an auto enthusiast. Can we go down and look at your garage?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, of course. It's something that we could do,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lead him out of the apartment and down a short hallway that wasn't there before to a door for the elevator. I push the button and immediately the doors open and we step into the elevator. After the doors close, we are lowered to the basement level. The doors open and we behold a ten-car garage with an assortment of vehicles to look at. Again, the textures and reflections are just like the real-thing, but these are my cars in the game. Right in front of us is a matte forest green and matte olive drab Dominator, a Ford Mustang look-alike, customized to look like the Hoonigan mustang of Ken Block in his latest Gymkhana. The rims most of all are supposed to look like the rims on that real-world car. Just seeing it before my eyes is a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my friend is attracted to the car right next to it. Dressed in a glossy metallic sky blue primary finish with the secondary detail in all out chrome that snakes its way from the side of the car to the back where it surrounds a pair of triple rectangular taillights, the car my friend has set his sights on is my Blade, a muscle car like the Dominator, though made to look like a San Andreas lowrider with the Dayton-type wired wheels and white walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move on to the next car, which is a sports car called the Massacro, which is like a Ferrari. It's painted in metallic silver with ice white sports rims. A car styled in inspiration from a car that belongs to another friend of mine, in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, painted in the same colors as the Dominator, though with olive green paint on the tuner rim is another sports car. Just like the new Nissan Skyline, this car is named the Elegy RH8. Everything is just the same as I left it. Next to that was my only super car, the Turismo R. Like the Dominator and Elegy, it's painted in the same military matte colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo list the other cars in my garage, from right to left: my Sultan, a four-door sports car like a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, painted in the same military matte colors; my all-black convertible coupe, the Felon GT; another all-black coupe that looks the same as the last one, except with four doors, the Felon; a four door sedan that looks like an old-school Skyline, a brown Warrener with tuner rims; and a stock white Baller (second version).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm kinda liking my super car, but I do want to try taking a chill drive through Los Santos in my Felon. Or should I let my friend take my Blade for a spin?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My friend asks like a kid asking his mom if he can have a new toy. \"Go ahead,\" I say with a scoff. He goes for the driver's side door, but fortunately the lock is locked. \"I think it should open just for me, kid.\" But when I try the passenger side door and pull the handle, I'm surprised to find the door is locked as well. I try the driver's side, to see if I have permission to get in the car, but the locks for me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a key for this one,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in this version of the game, we do,\" I mention. I look at the workshop where a laptop sits as well as a radio that's turned off. I check the cabinets, which were just for show in the last game, and find an assortment of tools, nuts and bolts, and lastly one dedicated to the keys of the cars in my garage. Nifty and just like the real world, but what would happen if we lost the keys? Does this world have a AAA or tow service? What would happen if we were blown up with the keys on our person? There would only be one way to find out, but would it be worth it, even if we can respawn?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find one that has a tag, \"Vapid Blade,\" attached to the key ring. I toss it to my friend, who uses it on the lock on the door, since it's an old-style car, and luckily, the key unlocks the door. He enters and puts the key into the ignition. Immediately, once the engine turns over, the garage is filled with the purr and roars of the car. A smile appears on my face and I rush to get into the passenger seat. Instinctively, as if I feel like I'm entering and sitting in a real car, I put on my seatbelt. I tell my friend to do the same, but he scoffs at the idea of the seat belt. He refuses to put it on, making the excuse that in online, our avatars cannot fly through the windshield. I'm not taking my chances with him behind the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls out of the parking space and for some reason, a guy dressed in a jumpsuit comes out of the elevator as we near the garage. He simply waves at us and presses a button, which lifts the door that reveals a driveway that leads up to the parking lot. The view outside is familiar, since I purchased an apartment that was part of a recent update in the old-gen console. This was one of many properties in the downtown area of Los Santos. My friend drives up the driveway and I look back and see the mechanic, again waving at the car, and him lowering the door. My friend turns up a ramp and we see a construction site on the other side of the freeway. He stops to adore the activity across the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last-generation of the game, the construction site was empty. No workers, no foremen, not even a spawned vehicle used in the making of the building. Now, in this real life world, there are workers on all levels of the building, and people operating the cranes which carry materials from the ground to the top of the building. I lower my view and suddenly a Feltzer, sort of customized sports car that resembles a street-legal race car flies in front of us, weaving in and out of traffic. Was that another player in the game? Or could it be an NPC?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend, as if by instinct, doesn't want to stay and find out. He pulls out of the parking lot and turns left instead of right, where the car was heading. He drives across the bridge and we both don't even speak, for our mouths a gaping in wonder of how living and breathing this world is. My friend drives my Blade at a comfortable pace, leaving the downtown area and moving into the Vinewood Hills area, which is like Beverly Hills in geography and districts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems my friend want to get out of the city and into the wilds of Blaine County. He gets on the Great Ocean Highway and I just sit back, looking at the view. I observe the real textures of the rocky cliffs and hills and admire the sun as it beats its warm heat down on the city and landscape. I open the window and let the wind pass by my hair. As a new thing, I take off my hair tie, which is wet from the shower, and let my hair flow down naturally. I'm surprised at how long it is, going past my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar roar of motorcycles pass us by in the oncoming lane and their familiar formation and their leathers show us that the Lost Brotherhood still rides on the roads. On the way, we pass underneath the military base of Fort Zancudo. We actually see Lazers, the fighter jets, and Titans, like C-130s, take off from the runway. My friend spies a Cargobob, a sort of Chinook, double-rotor cargo helicopter fly in as we exit the tunnel underneath the runways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we enter the woodlands near Paleto Bay and catch glimpses of the huge mountain, Mt. Chiliad, which looks much bigger up close and personal. We make a stopover on one of the main streets in the small town in the northwest of the county and get out. I feel the hot humid air mixed with a cool breeze from the ocean to the west. We both know that in about 3 years from now, when the story mode of Grand Theft Auto 5 begins, soon the bank in this city would get robbed. I wonder if we stayed here for that long, would it really happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a bunch of things we can do here. We can simply explore a town that seemed insignificant in Online. Or we can peruse through some of the businesses here. I believe there's a clothes store down the street and an Ammu-Nation, a limitless supply of guns and ammunition for sale on the highway itself. Or we could go to the Tramway that leads up to the summit of Mount Chiliad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should the two of us do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My friend steps out of the driver's side door and when he feels the climate, he stretches out his arms and breathes in the air. \"Wow, away from the city with my best friend driving around in a cool car. This new update sure is the best they come up with yet,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, something feels fishy. How did Rockstar and the consoles come up with a way to fully immerse their players as if they are playing the game. I thought it was just first-person perspective they added,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can worry about all that later, when we're too tired to play. Since this is Paleto Bay, there should be something we could do here. How about get some new clothes or some new guns?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there was something about Paleto Bay that I can't recall what was unique about it,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he was a contestant in a game show, my friend raises his arm and answers, \"It's supposed to be like the GTA version of palm springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palm Springs... oh, right, they had the Tramway,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tramway? Oh you mean the cable car, the one that goes up to Mount Chiliad?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sounds like a plan. I did want to go up there with this type of view,\" he says and walks back to the car, but teeters off-balance, almost into the path of a civilian car. I manage to get in between the car and my friend in time, only to get a rude reaction from the driver plus the honking of his horn. I hold my friend so that he can use me to balance himself. It is when I really feel how short I am compared to him. I'm about a foot shorter with my shoes. \"I'm feeling woozy, I think you should drive.\" I take him to the passenger seat and allow him to open the door and get in. I round the other side of my Blade and get in the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the configuration of the suspension, the front is higher than the rear and with the seat, which sits far back, I can barely see out the front window. I adjust the seat and hope that it would let me see out. I then find a button that seems to stand out from the rest of the controls in the car. I press it and flip the switch right next to it and slowly, but surely, the front of the Blade lowers, as if on airbags. I look over at my friend, but he has fallen asleep by now. I guess this discovery is only for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn over the engine, which wakes my friend up, and start on my way back to the highway, to the place where the bottom of the Tramway is located. \"How long was I out?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couple minutes,\" I say, turning a corner and then another to get back onto the highway. I drive through the area with the tall trees, possibly redwoods, and at the next intersection, arrive at the Tramway Base Station. I park the car near the stairs and help my friend out of his side of the car. I allow him to wrap his arm around my shoulder and guide him up the stairs to the platform. A single lady at a ticket booth which I haven't seen before gestures with her hand to continue on, telling me, not that many people even go up in the cable cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the platform, I help my friend onto it and have him sit down on the bench inside. As a precaution, I sit right next to him so that I can keep him stable if he manages to teeter off to one side. Again, he falls asleep as I take in the sights of the ocean and the rocky cliff faces of the mountain. Halfway up, the cable car jolts due to the line have slack or something other than that and in the jolt, my friend leans over his whole weight to my side. I have to catch him and hold him up, but in doing so, he unconsciously wraps his arm around me, planting his hand on my hip, whereas his other hand manages to fall on my leg, gripping it at the knee. His head as well lands on my chest, where one of my breasts is used as a pillow. At least he's not doing this consciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally reach the top of the mountain and we are able to get off the cable car in time, but when it comes to see the sights, I'm too concerned for my friend's well-being due to his bandage being awfully bloody and him not being able to stay awake all the time. I feel like this world is much too real. I try to deduce what happened to my friend after I shot him and he despawned from my apartment. Did he respawn outside and find the bandage on his head? Did the paramedics in the game, who don't save lives, patch him up in that way? If that's the case, then the treatment was only superficial and didn't treat any injury below the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit him down on the ground and pull out my phone. Should I call 911 in order to get him to a hospital? No. Paramedics would just come and put a band-aid on his gunshot wound. I need to have someone gets us to the nearest hospital. There was one in Paleto Bay, but we were too focused on having fun than to just do a simple checkup. But how would I get down the mountain? Taking the cable car back down takes too long, so I need a faster way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat method of transportation should I employ?</span></div></div>",

He then goes on to tell me that since the crew was doing an event today, half of the crew are now trapped online. At this time, we don't know if people could actually log in from the real world. Before the awkward silence kicks in, I immediately tell him about my concerns with my friend's injury. I tell him that I shot him self defense after he lunged at me and molested me. A brief silence ensues after I hear Fresh giggle, but he apologizes and stops, allowing me to continue. I then tell him how he respawned with the bandage on his head and my belief that it was only superficial healing. \"No joke. I ran into another player in my car and in retaliation, he pulled out his gun and shot up my car. Despite the concussion from the collision, I got a bullet in the shoulder, but luckily I wasn't caught in the explosion when he shot up my ride,\" he explains. \"Things are a lot more real now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he tells me. \"I had to eat some food to heal, but boy was that eCola nasty. Actually all the food is nasty, no taste at all. Either bland or bitter, neither sweet or savory. Say, you were talking about your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's dizzy most of the time and his bandage is soaked in red. I need to get him to a hospital so he can heal better, but we're on top of Mt. Chiliad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh snap!\" he exclaims. \"So you were asking for a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can you bring one over. Something fast so we can get to a hospital quickly,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" he tells me and hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he bring to get us to a hospital?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After putting my phone back into my pocket, I sit down next to my friend, who tries to stay awake, but can't. When I look at him next, I find him on his side with his face in the dirt. I quickly lift him up and dust off his face, but after finding that he weighs much more than me, I can only manage to lift him only a few inches. In this state, he is dead weight. I sit next to him and put his head on my lap, a position that is awkward in how it feels, but it should keep his face out of the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple backpackers pass us by, but they quickly go on their own way. Actually, it feels they are rushing away from us rather than being regular NPCs that ignore us until we do something brash like shoot our guns. They mutter to themselves loudly and I can hear what they say. \"They must be from out of town,\" is what one of them says. \"Best not to bother them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe wait there for what seems like ten minutes. In that block of time, I can neither admire the weather, the blue sky, the breeze, the sunlight or the realness of the ground we sit on. I can only concern myself with the well-being of my friend. I ask myself, will he just respawn with a fresh bandage after he succumbs to his internal injuries?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that block of time, I hear the sounds of a big helicopter in the distance, but since the volume is slowly growing, I can tell it's getting closer to our position. Did Fresh go out of his own way and got us a military helicopter? And did he do it in such a way that it didn't bring a trail of military personnel and police in his wake? That would cool of a crew leader to do for his members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look towards the direction where the sounds are coming from, but find nothing. In about five minutes, I see what looks like a green helicopter with a red tail approaching the peak of Mt. Chiliad. Once I see it, I wave my hands up and try to signal to the pilot that we are down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter lands  in a semi-flat area next to the top base station for the Tramway. From the passenger seat, out comes an avatar I recognize. He approaches and after seeing the state my friend is in, I see an expression of shock and surprise on his face, which must be from seeing the sight of the bloody bandage, which begins to slowly trickle with dark red blood. The man approaches and helps me get my friend up to his feet so we can walk him to the chopper. He opens the rear passenger doors and allows me and my friend to get seated and buckled, just in case we fall out. He gets back into the co-pilot seat and closes his door, drowning out the roaring sound of the rotors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, the helicopter ascends into the sky and quickly we get back to Paleto Bay. The helicopter descends rather quickly and once close to the hospital, the pilot lands the vehicle across the street in the junkyard. A pair of paramedics looks to be stocking up their ambulance with supplies, so I rush across the street and tell them that we have an injured man across the street. Instead of being ignorant, they immediately assist, bringing over a gurney where they put my friend on before making their way across the street. Once inside, the paramedics, as if they already know, tell the receptionist, \"He's a white male, possible mid-twenties, gun shot wound to the head, superficial bandaging. Need to go straight to ER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk him past a door that we are not allowed to enter, so, both me and my fellow crew member, wait in the lobby. After about an hour or so, a doctor comes out and comes to us. \"Your friend is lucky he came to us. We had to do reconstructing of his skull as well as replace nerve connections in the brain. He might have memory loss, but in the long-run, he should be okay,\" he says and leaves, not sticking around to answer any questions we might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward silence is broken when my crew member asks, \"Did you need a ride back to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do. I left my car near the Tramway Station, but I think I can just have my mechanic pick it up for me,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can just get a taxi and we can go pick it up. I'll offer to drive if you want to rest,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I am feeling a bit tired from everything, anyway\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend and I get into a cab that's conveniently stopped in front of the hospital to drop off a passenger. He drives us to where my car is and my crew member pays by sliding a card that comes out of his wallet. \"Is that a Shark Card?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a Maze Bank card,\" he says as he and I get out of the taxi. \"It comes standard with us online players.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I overheard an NPC that said we are from out-of-town,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some say we are foreigners, some say we're aliens, a whole lot say we are criminals,\" he mentions. \"Whatever we are, we are not citizens of this county of Los Santos.\" We walk over to where my Blade is parked. \"Wow, this yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, but I'm thinking of selling it and getting a Hotknife,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muscle for muscle. So, I'm driving,\" he clarifies and I nod in agreement. I unlock the car and  get into the passenger seat while he climbs into the driver's seat. I give him the keys and he turns the engine over. \"Mmm... I love that purr.\" He pulls out and gets back onto the highway. We don't exchange much in way of conversation and before I know it, I fall asleep due to some kind of fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, where do I find myself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wake up feeling rested, but in the virtual world, can we ever call it rest. I wake up in the passenger seat of a car, but it's not my Blade. It's actually the interior of a much modern car and a four-door sedan to boot. Outside of the car there are many other cars, and judging by the number of them, there is at least thirty. They are in a parking garage, but since most garages have the same style, I can't tell where in Los Santos this garage is located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI check my person and find that I'm still wearing the clothes I had on when my crew leader and I left Paleto Bay. I can only assume that I wasn't touched while I was sleeping. I get out of the car and all my senses are overwhelmed by this event that's happening. I smell the fumes of exhaust as well as a slight lingering of burnt rubber. I hear the rumble of engines as well as tires squealing in the distance. The air in the parking garage is cold, though when near a car, it actually is warmer. The parking garage lights do little in illuminating, but the light I see is sourced from the headlights of car that are on, pumping the sounds of the various radio stations in the county.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk out a bit and see a GTR-look-alike called the Elegy dressed in blue and yellow slowly pass through the garage. Behind him comes in an all-black Coquette and one of the car that came in the latest update, a Dodge Charger look-alike aptly named the Dukes. After they pass I try to leave for another place where I can find the crew leader, since this is probably his car that I came out of, but when I do, I'm stopped by a group of girls dressed in heels and skirts and dresses. They don't look to be too friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girl, how come I see you come out of Fresh's ride, huh?\" she aggressively asks. In her heels, she is inches taller than me and with her outfit, which is bright and all-out, she is quite intimidating. She also doesn't allow me to answer. \"You think you his girlfriend or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden I hear the cocking of a gun and the very same gun, which has a platinum finish, is pointed at the temple of the girl who's bothering me. \"We don't stand for bullying in this crew,\" says the man who's holding the gun to her head. As if knowing that a bullet will most likely damage her skull and send blood and brain matter on anyone or anything that's within a meter or two of her head, she doesn't tempt the guy and backs away with her crew of women. I can finaly take a deep breath while also peeking at the face of the man who saved me. He holsters his weapon and turns to me. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I answer. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" the man says. \"It's what lieutenants do. Keep the peace amongst the muscle and enforce the rules. But you're not muscle though. Representative for Fresh Snapmatic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think and recall on my last visit to Social Club. I remember seeing a post on my feed that I was promoted from Muscle to Representative. \"Yeah,\" I answer and also tell him my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Snapmatic is well.. fresh,\" he compliments with a male giggle. He also tells me his rank in the hierarchy and his name. I reach out a hand and he does the same, shaking it firmly. The man checks his phone, which is vibrating and he looks at the screen. \"Crew Leader Fresh wants the crew to assemble in the parking lot. Muscle on bottom floor and respresentatives, lieutenants and commissioners with him on the top floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crew meeting,\" he tells me. He escorts me to the stairs and we both make our way to the top floor. When we get there, there are already at least a hundred people surrounding a van called a Youga with a man on standing on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe join the crowd and hear the speech that our crew leader is telling us. \"We all know what's happened. If you don't know, this is not a 30-player lobby. Everyone who has been online and logged in into GTA Online since noon of today has been put into this virtual world of Los Santos. Everything that you've done in the game can be done here, and then more. Hours ago, I had to medivac a people who suffered a headshot wound, but never recovered from it. If you are hurt from a fall, a gunshot or explosion and died and respawned, do not continue doing what you were doing. Get yourself to a hospital. If you cannot, ask your crew to help you out. Right now it seems that half of our crew is in this world and parts of ten smaller crews are also here. We are the biggest and most dominant crew in this world at this moment, but that does not mean we get to take Los Santos for ourselves. As crew member, I'm authorizing that Commissioner will keep the peace and enforce the rules that our crew upholds. Lieutenants will support them. I will have our representatives and our muscle go our and find ways to logout,\" Fresh says loudly to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the muscle shouts from below, \"So keep killing to a minimum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murders and shootings that have no purpose is no allowed. That said, any accidents is tolerable, but if it's from any horseplay, then you will have to be detained. So far there is no dunce pool for bad players,\" Fresh explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the NPCs? Any changes from them?\" another from the muscle shouts from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NPCs or as we want to call them, citizens, have changed as well. They are more intelligent and will not be as ignorant as they were before. That said, be sure to be mindful of the law enforcement. We enforce rules in the crew, but ultimately, the police and military are the authority above the higher-ups in the crew including myself,\" Fresh answers. There are no more questions from the group nor from the crowd surroudning the van Fresh is standing on. \"Alright. There is work to be done, but take this night to rest up and talk amongst yourselves. We don't want to do any jobs or activities until we know how to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFresh turns around and jumps down from the van, but at the moment, a car explodes on the street. We look over the wall and see that there are actually two and they both block the entrances to the parking lot. The muscle down below disperses towards the lower level of the parking garage. Soon after, we hear the sounds of squealing tires and sirens in the distance. We also hear the sounds of several helicopters as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd on top of the parking garage is more calmer than the bottom and to each member who has a car, he or she quickly gets to their respective vehicle. A hand grabs mine, since I'm left standing where I was standing when I was listening to the crew leader speak. The hand pulls me with enough force to get me running at the same speed he or she is running at. Who has grabbed my hand?</span></div></div>",

He leads me downstairs to the bottom floor and helps me over the wall to the street below. He leads me to his Mesa, an off-road vehicle that's decked out with roll-bars. He gets in and I get into the passenger seat. He at once peels out of the scene, but minutes after, when stopped at a red light, we see SWAT vans and even military trucks going the opposite way. A couple minutes later, he gets a call from a friend who sends him pictures of the parking garage barracaded by vehicles and anyone who has a weapon and is out in the open, sharpshooters in the helicopters are taking pot shots at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone else is also able to get live video from a undisclosed location across the street from the parking garage. The scene shows the police telling that they have whole place surrounded and that they are looking for everyone, who has murdered or behaved recklessly (which obviously would include everyone who has played the game) to turn themselves in. If not, the police will start killing everyone. All the exits are blocked with exploded cars and there are many guns pointed to the interior of the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lieutenant pulls off the street and tells me, \"We can't leave the crew like that.

My friend teeters a bit, but manages to stay on two feet. It's the seconds right after that this feeling comes over me. Do I, as a woman in this game, have intuition like they do in the real world? Seconds after, I feel like my friend was momentarily caught off guard by my slap, but as he recovers, he thinks to retaliate, as in escalate from his boob poke to something bigger. Like he wants to pounce on me like I'm a gazelle in the African savanna. He recoils his face back to me with the surprised look and in that moment I feel like his brows would furrow in anger, but he surprises me by saying, \"Wow,\" with an even brighter expression of amazement. \"That hurts, like crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo save me from being the awkward person, I take the nerd route. \"Yeah, I know right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hurts, hurts and what feels nice, really feels nice,\" he says, moving forward. At this split second I feel like he is going to do something to me and I wince for no reason. All I feel is a breeze pass over me and when I open my eyes, I see my friend hurdle over the back of the couch onto the cushions. What would be hard polygons with no softness in the virtual world of this game, is an actual leather couch in this experience. I leave my position and take a seat on a nearby couch. Indeed the cushions support my bottom and are not hard at all. The comfort it provided rivals that of the real thing. \"We should go out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" I exclaim, jumping to an awkward conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at me with an expression that ask the question: 'Really?' \"Not like that, stupid. You're a guy obviously in the real world, but in here-- well... that's awkward. Me going out with my friend who's a girl in the virtual world and a guy in the real world?

His eyes squint, as if in pain or discomfort, and then he turns back to me. This time I defend myself by standing my ground and crossing my arms across my chest, unbeknownst that doing so further accentuates my bust line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" he starts, \"when I poked your breasts, how did it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncomfortable and awkward,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you've never been a woman, right?\" he asks, which brings up a point. Never has a game ever been this immersive. Yes, Grand Theft Auto was a game that immersed an avatar in a large city, but still players were still controlling them via third-person from behind a television screen or monitor, controlling everything at the press of a button or by manipulating a joystick. Never has a game put players into the world, where their own actions are what controls their character. Myself, being a man, has never have had boobs that had been poked by another person. And to have it done to me was uncomfortable and awkward. But why? How? How would the makers of this game, if it was their true intention, make it possible for a man who has never felt what it would feel like to be in a woman's body to feel everything a woman's body feels? \"I wonder if it do the same for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friend's second question takes me out of my lengthy reverie. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back,\" he says, \"I still haven't made a second character. So keep your phone on, I might need a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I ask, but he does not answer as he turns on his heel and walks out the door. Again, I am alone, and a feature on my phone, which is signaled by a simple notification ring, tells me the session feed. The entry in particular notes that my friend, using his name, has left the apartment. A second entry right after that tells me he has left the session. If he left, does it mean I can leave too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI check on that, searching my phone to see if there is an app on the phone or there is something in the settings that will allow me to leave the game. After five minutes of searching, I find it at the very bottom of the rather long, settings menu. In comparison to the old-gen, the new menu has about five times as much content just in the settings, the majority of which is tied to the preferences of the phone. Just like in real life, there are a bunch of stuff here that is unknown to me. But on the very bottom reads, \"Log Out.\" When I press it with my finger, an orange circle animation populates most of the screen and swirls clockwise, the very same animation when it periodically saves the game. It swirls for about ten second before a box with a message pops up onto my screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reads, \"Sorry, this feature is not available at this time. Please try again later.\" How could this mean? My friend was able to leave the session, but what happened to him if he didn't leave the game? Where exactly did he go? The message and the circle animation fades from the screen and shows the default home screen. Another beep signals another notification, found under an app named \"Brief,\" which looks like a rounded square with a picture of a man's underwear on it. A circle with the number \"1\" is found in the corner of this app icon. When I open it the app, a large message reads, \"All DLC's are now available and have been added to the game. All items that can be purchased have been added as new stock on all websites, stores and shops in Los Santos. Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered that there were DLC's available and the last one, which gave us five Heist missions to play with other players, was the last that I had before switching over. The latest, the Ill-Gotten Gains: Part I update, was what brought me to new-gen. i wonder if this update was what is keeping us in the game in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy phone beeps again, but it's with a different sound, more like the one that signals that I get a message, but a bit different. I unlock my phone and see that a update has been added to the Email app on my phone. We had received it during the Heist update, but it was rarely used, due to it being limited in its effectiveness. I wonder who has sent me a message through Email. I open up the application and find a single message by... who?</span></div></div>",

It's not that it's someone that is fraudulently playing as my friend, but it's actually the friend who had just left writing this as some other avatar. At least, that's what I understand. The message is long and also has attachments with it, something very new to the Email tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open it and read, \"Dear Rianna (I think that's what you call your character). Sorry for poking you in your boob, but after you slapped me, you sort of gave me an idea. As I said, I haven't made a second character before. I didn't really need to and it wasn't necessary at the time, but that's where I went. I somehow left the session and was teleported to the police station. Somehow the system or the game knew that I wanted to make another character and gave me everything i need to do it. I made myself a woman and I'm writing this email to you to prove that I did make myself like you. I have boobs with this character and it feels like my dick has been cut off, but not painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me yet, check out these photos,\" the message ends and i have to press the button with the paperclip icon on it. A pop-up appears with a loading animation and three rectangles appear. Each takes about a couple seconds to load, after which a picture fades into view. My mouth gapes seeing what I'm seeing. The clothes are very iconic, being that it is the very same outfit that I had on my female character when I first started GTA Online. A dark gray tank top with white accents on the straps and bottom hem and a pair of running shorts plus slippers for the feet. But it's not the outfit that surprises me. It's the person wearing the outfit that shocks me. It none other than a woman. Is this the person who sent me this message? And if so, is this my friend? I won't know until I find out for myself in person. Did he say he might need a ride?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, new players would have to be picked up by the idiot friend of Franklin Clinton Lamar. And to go through that process a second time. I finally understand what he meant. The message continues, \"I'll be flying into Los Santos so I will need you to pick me up at the airport. Bring a nice car when you come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminds me. I have a total of three garages, which are all filled with vehicles. From cars to trucks to bikes. The first of which is part of this current apartment. All I have to do is take the elevator down to the basement level, where the garage should be located. The other two I would either drive to either one using a car from the first garage or I can utilize a certain contact in my phone's directory to deliver a certain car straight to me. Which option should I use?</span></div></div>",

The subject of the message says, \"URGENT.\" Thinking it to be a emergency, I open it and read the rest of the message. \"To whom may be concerned,\" it starts, \"You may have noticed by now that your perspective of the world is different. Let's say, a little bit more real. Los Santos is a living, breathing city visited by people from out of town, but prior to today, those visitor became citizens. Leaving is no longer possible. Don't believe me? Try taking a boat or a plane and making your way to the edge of the map. Try swimming back and not get eaten by sharks. Do not be ignorant to how you're reading this with your own voice and with the moving of your lips which are connected to a very sensitive body, one that can feel and get hurt. Though it may look like the city you know, Los Santos is very much real. Be careful who you run into, because this is not the game you played before anymore. As your closest friend, i may be able to assist you in finding a way out. Come find me at the Vanilla Unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it true that we cannot escape from this game and that we cannot log out? He knows of the fact that at the edge of the map, above the water and before the endless horizon there is an invisible force that keeps players in and in an effort to discourage exploring beyond the borders, the force not only keeps us within the map, but also destroys the craft that we are on, be it a plane or a boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shocks me is the presence of wildlife, which wasn't included in Online sessions since the game first came out. To think Online would be just the same in this different perspective, with the only dangers being yourself, other players and law enforcement. Now, with the game becoming real, Los Santos and Blaine County and the ocean that surrounds it is no longer safe with animals all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This guy seems to know the truth, as if he has experienced it firsthand. The city of Los Santos is real, but to this guy, it's too real. I can easily ignore this guy and just enjoy the game how it is now. Though, ignoring truth seems to be the last thing I should be doing. I could easily ask him if he legitimately has found no way out of this game. What should I do?</span></div></div>",

A circular icon that spins appears over it and after a couple seconds, it disappears from the application. I check my inbox and find it empty. No sign of that message in sight. I close my phone and look outside the window. This whole city, ready and waiting for me to explore it. What better way than to get into a car and drive. I go for the entrance door to my apartment and open it, revealing an almost featureless hallway behind it. A series of elevator line one side of the hallway. I push the call button and find an elevator ready and waiting for me, opening its doors for me to enter inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discover the garage button and press it, watching it illuminate with a yellowish-white light. The doors close and the lift begins to lower itself down at a mild pace, not too slow, but not too fast. Eventually, the lift reaches the bottom and the door open, revealing a bright room beyond it. I can already see the cars in my garage. A matte black Pegassi Zentorno with Ultra Blue accents sits before me right as I leave the elevator. It's a car that is similar in styling to a Lamborghini Aventador. Right across from it is my one and only racecar, Dewbauchee Massacro. Like the Zentorno, it's styled in a Metallic Black primary paintjob with Ultra Blue on the roll cage and on the sports wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk further into the majority of my garage, seeing the rest of the cars as I have left them. Though there is an empty spot where I was going to put one of the new cars from the latest Ill-Gotten Gains: Part 1 update. I was going to put the Benefactor Stirling GT, styled like a Mercedes 300 SLR, right next to the racecar. Right across from the empty space is one of three muscle cars that I have in my total collection. A car from one of the recent updates, styled like a old-generation, Dodge Charger SRT, is my Albany Dukes. The beast looks like Vin Diesel's car in the first Fast and Furious film, since it has a Metallic Black finish with a hug-catcher popping up out of the hood. It sits on Tuner wheels, Gruppe Z is the set they are named after, which has a chrome lip and a red middle six-spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the Dukes, is my Dominator, which looks like a modern Ford Mustang. Like most of my vehicles, the Dominator is colored with a Matte Black primary paintjob that is coupled with a Metallic Orange secondary, which shows up on on the racing stripes on the top of the cars and the two on each side. The wheels are also blacked-out on this vehicle. Across from the Dominator, is another look-a-like from the Fast and Furious movie. The Karin Sultan, painted with an all Metallic Black paintjob and sitting on Chrome wheels, is made to look like the Honda Civics Dominic and his heist team drive when taking down big rigs on the highway in the movie. When the car is running, the iconic green neon glows underneath the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the Sultan, is a pink Bravado Banshee. I initially got it with its top off, in a roadster style, but due to the Ill-Gotten Gains update, the game got an ability to be able to put the roof on in the modification garage. There is a carbon fiber hood on the front, but that is dominated by a white stripe that stretches from the front to the rear of the vehicle. Like the Dominator, the Banshee sits on all-black wheels. Across from the Banshee is another car I got from a recent update, namely the first ever unlocked in the Heists update. Painted in an Ice White Metallic paintjob and red on its roll cage, the Karin Kuruma contrasts greatly with my black Sultan, though the similarities lie with it four-door format. It sits on black rims as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the Banshee and Kuruma, is twin Annis Elegy RH8's, though one is fully upgraded while the other is only visually upgraded. Both are modeled after tuned-up Nissan Skylines, but differ in how they are styled. The weaker version is painted in a Matte Black paintjob with Metallic Wine Red for the accent and wheels. The fully-upgraded version is modeled after a former model's Skyline. Switched with a Wine Red Metallic with a ice white Pearlescent, the primary paintjob is made to look like the matte finish of the real world model. Accenting it is the carbon fiber versions for the bumpers and skirts and even the roof is made out of carbon fiber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the back, right behind the black Elegy is a bike rack with three bikes that I bought long ago. I have a road bike, a BMX bike and a mountain bike on the rack currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, this finishes the whole line up of the cars in my current garage. I also have another apartment with its own ten-car garage and another standalone garage near the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I go out using the cars in this garage or take one of my bicycles to make my way to the other garages? If I take my bike, which garage should I head to?</span></div></div>",

Instead of becoming the subject of a cinematic of my avatar moving past the door's threshold, when I twist the doorknob, nothing happens. Just resistance. it doesn't swing open like there is no bolt in the door, for there is. I twist the knob and push the door open. Beyond the door is a simply hallway. Several other doors, possibly to other apartments in the building line one wall distanced from each other by twenty feet or so. On the other side of the hallway, two elevators sit about ten feet apart. I walk over to the elevators, using the call button to call the elevator up. I look up at the numbers and see both elevator climbing up and as they pass each floor, each number is illuminated with an orange glow. Eventually, the elevator to my left signals to me that it has arrived with a ding sound. The door slide apart, inviting me into the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk in and push a button labeled with a \"G\", thinking it will take me to my garage. The doors close and the lift begins to lower itself. it passes at least a dozen floor in the span of 30 seconds, which I say it pretty fast, before arriving at the determined floor. The doors open, just as they would in the game, revealing a small hallway that eventually opens up to a ten-car garage, which is filled with all types of vehicles. In this particular garage, I have bicycles, sports cars and super cars. Which should I take to make my way to Vanilla Unicorn?</span></div></div>",

Excitement isn't the word I would use for my emotion as I select the icon on my system's menu and activate it. The screen widens to the title of the game and a peculiar ornate ring with three heads: one of a dragon, one of a lion and one of a bird of prey, which was used as the logo. The screen fades to black, but also, for some odd reason, the lights in my room turn off and even the light from the street lamps outside darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA power outage? Please, don't let it be, I think to myself. The game just came out and I've already downloaded it. I suddenly feel like I'm not sitting down in a chair nor do my hands feel like they are holding a controller. Did I pass out? I now feel like I'm floating in an immense void. I cannot move, though I don't even see anything, any reference to indicate that I am in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I see something floating in front of me. It takes no form, as if it is a cloud of gas. It does in some angle resemble a large, but thin piece of of transparent linen, flying about on its own. What's unusual is that appears as if it is glowing, but I cannot detect a source of light anywhere. The object before my eyes stops in place abruptly and then as suddenly as it appeared, a voice emanates from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...!\" the first word comes in like a tidal wave, its sound crashing over my figure. The voice's volume dies down to a comfortable level as it continues to speak, though at first like I'm not even here. \"I am curious as to what this it. Never in the hundreds, thousands of decades, centuries, millennia have I witness this.\" It then addresses me. \"You. You have not died, nor have you lived. How then can you be here in Aetherius? You are neither Aedra or Daedra.\" Finally, it speaks of terms I'm familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAedra are immortals, some call them gods, that are somewhat, opposite to Daedra. The Nine Divines are such an example of Aedra, who are viewed as benevolent beings that reside in a realm that not mortal has been to, at least to the best of my knowledge. I'm more familiar with Daedra, who I have in my past gaming experience encountered to do harm to my avatar. They are viewed as malevolent, though at some time, unusually mischievous. All to their pleasure if I may add. This Aetherius, though, I'm unfamiliar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice speaks again. \"How can one with no soul, no life force, no physical body be mortal? That is what you are, are you not?\" I try to answer the question, but I find that I am unable to. \"Of course, no physical body means no mouth to speak with. Though, I sense you are mortal indeed, meant to tread the realm of Nirn? Wayward soul perhaps?\" Nirn! Another familiar term which is considered the mortal plane and the realm where players survive in. I try to say yes, but again, I'm unable to do so. I wonder if he could sense my affrimation. \"Curious! It has no mouth to speak, but it has affirmed my question! Mortal, I do not know what you are or why you are doing in Aetherius, the afterlife, but I can sense an eagerness to return to Nirn. Say, just out of curiosity, are you somehow supposed to partake in a battle? No, the correct word is war. Are you fighting in a war? Perhaps, against the dreaded Molag Bal and his realm of Oblivion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember what the theme was in Elder Scrolls Online. The backstory was about Molag Bal, who is a Daedric Prince, whose personal realm is Coldharbour, one of many realms in Oblivion. In the game, he seeks to pull all of Tamriel into it and enslave all its ihabitants. That probably includes players like me. I again affirm the question and the voice excitedly responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! I have heard of this clash. Many warrior of varying races have nobly partook in this war and have ended up here in Aetherius. But I sense you are greater than a mere warlock or soldier. Say, have you swore allegiance under a certain banner I have been hearing about? Are you part of the Ebonheart Pact? How about the Aldmeri Dominion? Daggerfall Covenant? Or perhaps you ally yourself with the Imperials?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have heard of these so-called \"banners.\" To regular players, only the first three were available to ally with. Imperials were included in the pre-order before the game released for the consoles. Since I pre-ordered the game, I could very well become an Imperial. Which banner should I fall under? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, an alliance of three races that have bad blood between each other,\" the voice responds, which I observe is loud enough to echo, though there are no walls for the sounds waves to bounce on. It's as if the void we are in not a void at all, but a rather spacious place devoid of any light.. \"Who knew out of the three main factions, an alliance between the Dark Elves, the reptilian Argonians and the cold-loving Nords could turn out to be a worthy contender in the Three Banners War. A war for something called the Ruby Throne. This is the war you are fighting, correct?\" I affirm the voice once more. \"Hmm, unstable politically, but with a firm foundation in regards to military prowess. Say, you're not a Dark Elf, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if what this voice is doing right now is somewhat like the introduction to any Elder Scrolls game. Players would have to pick a certain race and what gender that race is. Since I'm a male in the real world, the obvious way to go is to select a male character. I tend to go off the beaten path for my gender and choose the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Elf race that the voice mentions is one who resides in Morrowind, which is made up of two bodies of land. Mournhold, is part of the mainland and it surrounds a large island named Vvardenfell, where a large active volcano sits. It erupts, but not on a cataclysmic scale... not yet anyway. Since the game's timeline puts players in the Second Era, we don't have to worry about the devastating eruption that deems much of Morrowind inhospitable two Eras later. But this is why Dark Elves are dark. Due to constant eruptions and ash storms, the Dark Elves, or Dunmer's skin are as black and ashy as the ash that plagues the majority of the landscape. They are resistant to fire and have an affinity for magic and great intellect. Considering the history of conflict between the other races, they have become hardened warriors. They are slow to trust outsiders, but when their trust is gained, they become loyal followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you for a Dunmer, since I have seen many pass through from the mortal plane. If not a Dunmer, are you a lizard?\" the voice continues and then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard race that the voice is referring to is the Argonians, who are a reptilian race. They reside in the province of Black Marsh, which is located south of Morrowind. As its name suggests, its climate is that of a marshy rainforest, which include great inland waterways and impenetrable swamps. The Argonians, who look like bipedal lizards with varying patterns and colors on their scales and stand at a height of an average human, much like a talking velociraptor. Since most of their land is water, they can breathe underwater and blend in with their surroundings. This has made them proficient criminals, either in the trades of thieves or assassins. In my opinion, this might be the very reason they have to get back at their slave masters, for it was the Dark Elves of a particular House that ventured south to enslave the race for their plantations up north. They utilize magic as well, but are also keen on using stealth and short blades for offense. They are also like the Vietnam in their own war, since they use guerrilla warfare as a tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many scales litter the battlefield, or at least I have heard this is the case. These lizards too have found untimely rest in Aetherius. I wish I knew the real reason why these enslaved lizards have chosen to ally themselves with their former dark-skinned masters. If not a slave master or slave, as the previous two's history suggest, then do you love the cold? Ice and snow in particular,\" the voice again speaks and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must be talking about the Nords, who live in the harsh cold and icy, rocky landscape of Skyrim, west of Morrowind. In this timeline I don't have to worry about fighting dragons, since they, like the erupting of the volcano on Vvardenfell, happen in the Fourth Era. Some would say Nords are like Vikings in the real world. They love to laugh and fellowship over mead, but they glorify themselves in battle. Unlike the Dunmer or Argonians, they more keen on using weapons like axes, swords and arrows than using magic. That said, I've read that they are the frontline warriors of the Ebonheart Pact. Plus, it is said that most of Tamriel, which is the whole continent that Elder Scrolls is set in, was at one time, ruled by Nords. Not to mention, they have a barbaric abilities to send their foes running for their lives. Heck, my last character was a Nord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be welcome in Sovngarde,\" the voice responds, mentioning the afterlife of glorified Nords who died in battle, much like the real-world mythological realm of Valhalla. \"Eternal mead as well as eternal glorification of your battle prowess. But with no soul to fit a seat at the table, I cannot send you there. Tell me you're a Nord. If not, then what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I become?</span></div></div>",

I also observe the voice to be made up of multiple voices, which seems to bolster its volume but add a harmonious, yet creepy sound to it. The voices that I recognize are the deep, raspy voice of someone who has smoked too many cigarettes, the insanely high-pitched voice of one of the Chipmunks, a normal adult man's voice as well as the voice of a female child. \"Trying times must account for this unlikely unity. Who knew Bretons could convince the likes of the Orcs and Redgaurds? I smell money and the sheer lack of it. Your state of living has been hampered by poverty caused by trade routes being sacked and profits being stolen. Say, you must be a Breton like that Merchant King Emeric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel like what this voice is doing is somewhat like a character interview. Like all the Elder Scrolls games, they have players go through an introduction of what their character would be, what race the player would be as well as their gender. Obviously, since I'm a male in the real world, I should go for the same gender. But previously, when I played the last game, I was a Nord, who happened to be female as well. I think I'll stay within my desired gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Breton race that the voice mentions are a people of mixed blood, interbred with Elves long ago. This gives them an affinity for magic as well as for swordplay. Bretons are also unique in that they have the highest Speechcraft ratings out of all the races, making them excellent merchants and traders as well as diplomats. No wonder they formed an alliance with the Orcs and Redgaurds to form the Daggerfall Covenant. According to the game's lore, High Rock is where the Breton race call their home. It is one of the two provinces under the Covenant. Part of the province looks like a peninsula jutting out into the sea to the west while the portion to the east borders itself with Hammerfell, where the Redguards call their home. The landscape is varied, but mostly contains mountains to the north, covered by woodland forests. Much of the cities, where commerce takes place, happen to sit on the coasts surrounding the Iliac Bay, which sits opposite Hammerfell on the other side of the bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would make a great diplomat or merchant, if you could talk like a normal Breton that is. If not a charming fellow with Elven blood, then perhaps you are a Redguard?\" the voice speaks again and finally asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedguards, which I deduce are dark-skinned people like Dark Elves, but look more like real-world African-Americans. Like Nords, they are not keen on using magic and are more probable at wielding a sword than a spell. They are actually suspicious of magic. They are highly athletic and in my opinion, may have the highest number of athletic child prodigies, since every member of their race are trained from a very young age. They are also a martial people, prizing honor and dignity above all else. They used to live on an island continent to the west of the larger land mass of Tamriel, where most of the Elder Scrolls games are played on. Now they make their home in Hammerfell, which has a varied landscape of mountain ranges, grasslands and deserts. The Alik'r Desert is actually the most well-known and the most harshest landscape to have been settled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen many Alik'r warriors talk about leaving their curved swords behind as they passed into Aetherius and how they wished they didn't like to in that manner. I don't think you would be one to weild such a sword. If not a Redguard, then you must be a big bad Orc?\" the voice speaks up once more and after it is finished, asks another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Orcs, or Orsimer, which many mistake as the hideous pseudo-race of armies that was fought by the humans, elves and dwarves in the Lord of the Rings, are a race of barbaric warriors known for their steel and arms. Like the Elves in the game, they are a type of Mer, and have pointy ears like the elven races. They have formed their culture out of endless warfare and in my opinion, are like samurai of Japan. They embody the Darwinistic phrase, \"Survival of the Fittest,\" and weak is not part of their vocabulary, which is most spoken through a language of weaponry and smithing. The Orcs call their home within the province of High Rock, the same place where Bretons reside, though are more keen on taking up shelter in the mountainous regions or their own fortified strongholds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are under the banner of the Daggerfall Covenant, then you must either have charm, sheer athletics or a code of honor bathed in bloody battles,\" the voice says. \"So which are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich race should I choose to become?</span></div></div>",

Since I sense a fire in you that in the very least resembles the nomadic peoples of Hammerfell, I shall grant you a body that completely coincides with the culture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, and without very much warning, I start to feel sensations. Is this the game rendering a body for me? I was expecting to see a figure before me or whatever that floating substance is in front of me materialize into something vaguely humanoid, as I'm playing in third-person, though I am used to playing in first-person mostly. I didn't know they included real-time feedback. I'm not sure they even released any patch notes about an update. Almost immediately, I feel the sensations intensify, as if my whole body had been numb the whole time and the blood had just now started flowing throughout my body. The \"pins and needles\" feeling is so intense that I briefly yelp out in discomfort, letting out a higher-than-normal-pitch exclamation. The voice surprises me and I cover my mouth with my hands out of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mortal has a voice!\" the voice exclaims and then continues in a normal volume, \"and is a woman.\" He is not wrong in any way. Light from an unknown source shines upon my body and the first things I see is my hands and forearms. They are slender, almost completely hairless and smaller than my own male hands would have been. The skin is a slightly golden, mocha color, and in my opinion, looks to be the skin of a young adult Redguard. My toned arms are strong and are connected to a naked torso that is equally toned with a slender, athletic build. The breasts jutting out of my chest are a sight to see, but are quite awkward with my first-person perspective. These are ultimate my breasts. More light from somewhere beyond my sight shines on the rest of my body. A slender waist coupled with wide hips and muscular, yet beautiful legs form my lower portion and I'm surprised to see a void between my legs. I'm pretty sure through mods, one can make people transvestites, but in this moment, my female form is very much female. No sight of a phallic attachment down there at all. My scalp tingles the moment I look up at the source of the voice and I feel the roots are being tugged. It's as if a menagerie of unseen hands have braiding my hair that happens to be very long and silky into tiny braids and giving me cornrows, which I can immediately feel with my slender fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sudden as the numbness had gone away, the hands braiding my hair leave and I float in place admiring my Redguard figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now with a voice and mouth to utter that voice, tell me Redguard, do you believe this is but a dream?\" the voice asks. \"If you are able to fathom the possibility, this Aetherius may be a real place and that you have died for a reason that is beyond your comprehension, perhaps against your will. Or it can be a dream. But if you're a believer of dreams, then you must believe that most, if not all, can and have the possibility to become nightmares. Otherwise, this could all be in your head. What shall it be?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is all a dream, all in my imagination. It's not real at all,\" I tell him with a voice that is not my own. Instead of my manly voice, I answer his question with a higher-pitched voice of a woman, even with an accent to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mortal mind is a curious one. Interesting that it can be plagued by dreams and delusions,\" the voice says, though it seems that it's not directed at me but more to itself. The wisp in front of me begins to change, matrixing even. It begins to take the shape of a face and the face I see, though only a glimpse, is that of a old man wearing a hood. He utters a word or two, though neither his voice nor the voice that had previous been speaking to me matches the movement of his lips. Then it all fades from my sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I'm thrown downwards, though this time, I'm wearing what seems to be a burlap dress, that does little to cover much of my body. I can feel the torn hem of the makeshift gown of rags rubbing against the tender flesh of my buttocks. I can also feel a bitter cold breeze in between my legs, letting me know that I'm stark naked underneath this sack. The whole front of my body hits a cold stone floor. Something binding my hands together prevents me from breaking my fall and when I drop to the floor, sharp pain shoot through my frail and tired body. I land in what seems like a stagnant puddle of water, further dirtying my body. A hand rudely grabs several locks of my long hair and tugs on them until my head is lifted from the ground. I scream out in pain as, almost literally, my scalp is yanked off the top of my head. I try to resist, or at the very least, try to do something about the hand pulling my hair, but when I raise my hands up, I discover a pair of iron shackles tightly locked around my wrists. The shackles are connected with a heavy chain, which one end is connected to the collar of a person, a man by the looks of it, dressed similarly in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand pulls my hair once more to get me on my feet and I can finally see my surroundings. As my feet touch upon the cold floor, I realize even my ankles are chained together, the very weight of the bondage hindering any chance or swift escape. I can only walk forward as the person's neck in the front of me tugs at my shackles, pulling me along. To further dehumanize me, the guard or whatever behind me kicks me in the back, sending another blood-curdling scream out of my mouth. The scream is like that of a horror movie. To make matters worse, the scene before me comes straight out of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm chained in a long line of prisoners wrapped in raggedy tunics or simply rags, to cover their private areas. We are escorted down a tunnel devoid of any natural light, the only sources are from the torches that the guards hold in one hand. Everywhere I turn is stone. Dark and dank stone. Are we underground? In a castle perhaps? Are we headed to a dungeon? I ask myself. The tunnel then descends down a long flight of steps, the foot of which meets with an archway, another tunnel. As we descend, step by step, I can hear faint yelps and even screams coming from below. It's when we get to the foot of the steps do we see the cause of those screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel at the bottom is not long at all and dwarfs the length of the first tunnel I had found myself in. The room is mostly lit with candles and most of the light illuminates a banner hanging in front of the wall opposite the entrance. It's red, with gold border. In its center is a logo, something like resembles a skull with horns growing out the side and then downwards towards the floor. It's unrecognizable to me. In the center of the room is a raised altar, surrounded by hideous horns at its four corners. It's sharp edges are like those of a blade and a table drenched in blood tells everyone being brought into the room of their imminent fate. Hooded figures cloaked in robes surround the table, either unaware of the procession or unconcerned. The guards pulling the people in front of me remove the chains from wrists and ankles. Those with the awareness of what is about to happen try to make one last stand, which usually becomes futile. They try to twist and pull from the firm grasp of the guards, but they are either too weak or too fatigued to do so as they are forcibly taken to the altar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the altar is a monster of a man with a sinister grin on his face and a bloody dagger in his hand. When a man or woman is placed onto his or her back on the altar, at that moment something keeps them still. It's as if magic has taken a hold of them and bound them to the altar, making the armed madman's job more easier. Without warning, and without restraint on his part, he plunges the blade straight into the victim's chest, slicing through flesh and severing bone and stopping hearts. As the men and women die on the altar, their life force is sucked through the man's arms in a dazzling blue light. The lifeless body is then pulled off the altar by the hooded figures and dumped to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in my body starts to well up and despite the previous victim having helplessly flail about in an effort to escape once their chains were broken, I on the other hand, accept it. It's not my choice, but what choices do I have? I will be killed and my soul stolen anyways. The guard nonetheless takes me to the altar, where I can see the horrifying details of the man wielding the knife. He's not a man at all, but an Altmer, a High Elf. His lanky body is dressed in a dark robe that disappears behind the altar. Adorning his shoulders are flared pauldrons of the same material as his chest piece. He also wears a circlet around his pale forehead, which is fashioned with a violet jewel. His chest piece is also fashioned with the same type of jewel. So beautiful, yet so deadly. His expression is like he is deep in thought. Not one second is he concerned for my well-being. Why should he? He had just plunged a steel dagger in the last man who met him at the altar. That's when I see the black soul gem in his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards push and pull me onto the altar, positioning me onto my back. Again, I sit there still, as if I am too weak or fatigued to move, which in reality, I'm not. A hooded figure stands opposite the man, his hands pressed together, in a praying position. Behind his mask, I can guess that he is neither praying to the gods of this world nor is he wishing that I wasn't killed. Heck, I guess he is placing a soul trap spell on me, which does nothing physical, but in a sense, he's preparing for my soul to transfer. No time is wasted and no words other then my last-minute scream that is quickly silenced by the steel dagger effortlessly entered my chest. Light disappears from my eyes and it feels like my very soul is being sucked out of my physical shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after the knife plunges into my chest, my eyes discover that I'm flying through a tunnel of light, which end hides a hideous head of blue. It resembles the insignia of that skull and horns I saw before. It crashes through my eyes, which then gives me a glimpse of a realm that mirror thats of Tamriel, but is sick and twisted. The same horns that had surrounded the altar pop up in a barren landscape, guiding my eyes down a path of stone that is not of the real world, but of Oblivion. My sight rises, only to move out of the way of a ghastly procession of what looks to be Dremora and Medusa-like creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, to my left, the sound of a dragon is heard, but instead of a dragon, what lands to my left is a winged creature, like a morph gargoyle with the same skull and horns as that one at the end of the tunnel. He growls, expelling a breath of cold air that is like mist on a freezing day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then fly towards a large otherworldly door flanked by atronachs, the fire variant. I somehow materialize through it and find myself inside, which is filled with chaos. I see prisoner attempt to escape, only to be cut down by the atronachs like the two outside. Some of them gain the upper hand and disappear from my sight. I just hope that they were able to escape. My vision then fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, where do I find myself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next moment I open my eyes, I find myself laying on my side, my back to a dwindling fire inside what looks like a cave, lit, save for the light from the fire, but by an unknown light source shining through a grate in the ceiling. Opposite the cavern wall where the fire sat, is a gate made of metal and I realize where I am. I'm in a cell where the only place to escape is through the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to my feet, where I then realize how heavy I feel. Not heavy in terms of weight, but the sensation I feel mostly is similar to an everlasting  soreness in my muscles, like right after an extreme period of exercise combined with a depression leaning towards apathy. Despite this heavy feeling, I am able to move around even more freely than in my dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich reminds me. Was that a dream or a flashback? It felt so vivid, as if I was really there. Something tells me that I had been transferred from that bloody place to this horrifying realm. Is this Coldharbour, the realm of Oblivion belonging to the Daedric Prince Molag Bal? Instead of seeing everything unfold on a screen in the safety of my bedroom, I see everything through my own two eyes, in a body that's definitely not my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice that seemingly comes out of nowhere is suddenly heard, \"How do you feel? Can you move?\" It's the voice of a man, sounding as close as someone at my side talking into my ear, but when I turn around, I see no source. Not even a speaker or a pipe that leads elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing, but get to my feet, now realizing that I am dressed with a garment that is gentler than a burlap sack, but nothing more than the same material as a dirty rag. The gown, which is rather large and drags along the cavern floor, seems to cover my nakedness, though it seems, after passing into this realm, my nether regions, as well as my breasts, are covered with modest undergarments. My feet are bare, but what can I expect after finding myself in a cell that looks to be in an underground prison. The vision before I woke up in here although puts this prison carved into the side of a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a step, which shoots pain all through my leg, but I continue walking, as if I'm playing the game and my avatar doesn't register it, but it's difficult. I get as far as the iron bars, which looks twisted into the shapes of blades, though not as sharp as them. I bend down, seemingly out of breath, though in reality, the soreness in my muscles is hard to bear. I then see straight lines drawn into a pattern on the floor to my right. A wispy light descends down from the ceiling, creating a pillar of transparent light. A transparent figure of a man in a hooded robe holding a staff or walking stick in his right hand appears in the pillar of light. I instantly recognize him as the face drawn by the wispy material in that place called Aetherius. His speaks and his voice is the very same echoey voice I heard in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slowly, now,\" he tells me. Following his advice, I lean my tired body against the rock wall flanking the left of the iron gate. \"You've been through an ordeal. Take a few moments to collect yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow his advice and take a deep breath, but it only causes my chest to rise and fall, which causes my breasts to feel the roughness of the inside of my gown. Confused, I ask him with a voice that I'm still shocked of hearing coming out of my own mouth, \"What's happening? Who are you?\" I can't explain it, but it seems like I have been given the words to say and they are not my own to begin with. I could have asked him something else, something non-canonical to this world, but it's unusual that I don't decide to ask him any of those question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, he continues speaking to me. \"Like you, I am a prisoner of this place, yet so much more,\" he tells me, proving that I was right to call this place a prison. How can he be a prisoner if he can show a manifestation of himself in my cell? He further speaks, but further he confuses me. \"I am the past and the future, both. I am despair, and hope. The tapestry we weave is a complex one. You cannot hope to see its pattern in its entirety. Not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo confused to either decipher what he meant or formulate a question for the meaning of his monologue, all I ask is, \"What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must rescue me,\" he says. How am I supposed to rescue someone if I am the one that needs freeing from this cage? \"And I in turn must rescue you.\" He answers my question as I'm done doubting his command. \"You must escape this cell, take up arms and protect yourself. Then, find Lyris Titanborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow am I going to do that? I ask in my mind. Yet, with the question in my mind, the question I ask is, \"Lyris Titanborn? Who is that? I don't understand...\" He does not answer. He simply stays silent as he disappears as suddenly as he appeared, again in a flash of light. The pillar of light as well as the inscription on the ground disappears seconds after his departure form the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some of my strength somehow replenished, I go to the gates of my cell. I still see prisoners who have been freed fighting and killing the guards. Suddenly, from the left around a corner, an Argonian dressed in similar garments runs to the door. \"You there!\" he calls out to me, the hiss of his tongue ending his sentence. \"We are escaping! Let me open your door!\" The lizard man, whose red scales can also be found on his tail sticking out from his pants, He takes a pair of small tools from his pockets and fiddles with the door. He's using a lockpick! I exclaim in my mind. Effortlessly, in a mere ten seconds, he is able to unlock and open my door. I push against it, opening it and allowing it weight to hold the momentum and swing wide, stopping with a clang against the rock wall outside. \"That's it! Quickly, you must escape before the guards return!\" He tells me this as he runs the opposite direction, down a corridor where other prisoners are running down. There must be dozen, if not hundreds or thousands kept prisoner here. I wonder if any of these other prisoners are players too, but it's too soon to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run, finding it very difficult with the long gown I've been dressed in. I have to pick up the front of the dress in order to at least walk. Even more if I need to run, which everyone else is doing. As I run down the corridor, the man who had appeared to me in my cell begins to speak into my mind once more with his echoey voice, \"There are weapons in the forge beyond those cells. Arm yourself.\" About time I did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor bends right into a monstrous threshold that looks like a circular mouth with sharp teeth around the curved edges. Beyond this threshold is a room with three structures, as if they were stalagmites or stalactites, purposefully curved so that magic or whatever power suspends what looks like living draugr, or the reanimated corpses of Nords in Nordic burial sites in Skyrim, the last game I played. Upon closer inspection, as I run past one, a figure that levitates between the two structures turns out to me nothing but a full skeleton and the rotted skin covering it. The adrenaline pumping through my veins keeps me running, almost at the pace which the Argonian from before runs. I get to a room that has an assortment of cages, large and small, strewn around the walls. A table is set up in the center of this room, where a collection of weapons lay. Other prisoners grab weapons of all types from other tables further in the room, but none are taking the ones from this table. I wonder if this table was meant for me and only me. Heck, not even the lizard-man takes anything from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich should I take?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Grab something to defend yourself,\" the lizard says, \"Don't be greedy. We have a lot of prisoners to arm.\" Having found myself in the previous game with an affinity for ranged weaponry like bows and crossbows, I take into my hands a bow and a quiver that one has about ten arrows in it, though its weight suggests otherwise. My body probably does not have the strength to carry it, I suppose. I sling the arrows over my torso and ready my bow in my left hand, but with this armament, my gown is again going to get in my way. I'll trip and fall and hurt myself even before getting into some action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Argonian from before takes up a single sword with no shield, but lingers to wait for me. He finds my current garment to be a hassle and without saying a word, he offers his blade as assistance. I allow him to cut into the excess fabric and cut it all around so that half a foot or a full ruler of clearance from the bottom of the dress is above the floor. \"Thanks,\" I say to the lizard. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er-Jaseen,\" he tells me and then dashes for a nearby door. I too run over to the door, discovering I have a greater range of mobility with my dress at a shorter length, though, when I get out of this prison, I'll be sure to get something that will fit my fighting style. Several get to the door and when their hands press it, the doors open in a fashion that is like a chopping blade. The left and right sides separate, leaving the large middle piece which lowers into the floor. With the door open, the group rushes through the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore us in the next room, as many as there are prisoners, there are a wall of skeletons, animated by dark magic and wielding various weapons. The voice of the man speaks into my head again. \"An enemy approaches. Strike it down,\" he tells me. Immediately, I ready my bow  with my left hand and with my right, I remove an arrow from the quiver. I set it on the bow and knock it onto the string. As if I have done it before, I lift the bow all while pulling the string back. I take aim and release my hold on the string, which causes the arrow to shoot straight in the direction I am aiming. The arrow strikes the skeleton, but only manages to lodge itself in between two ribs. The hostile creature continues to approach, even gaining traction as it prepared to dashes towards me. The others around me have already rushed to meet their own skeletons with their own weapons, but a random swing from the Argonian's sword towards my skeleton parries the blow, staggering the enemy. It gives me enough time to ready another arrow and send it hurtling towards the skull, cracking it and causing the skeleton magic forces to dissipate, resulting in a mound of bonemeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go over to the pile after the action is over and most of the other prisoners, including Er-Jaseen, moves on to the next room. I retrieve my arrows after making sure they are still good for penetration enemies and killing them. It seems in this game, there is more quality control and if a weapon is still able to do damage and can be remove easily from something like a corpose or in soft ground, then it could still be used. Not like the previous game where a fraction of your arrows are lost to the game's system and are not recoverable. Still, how can this game be so lifelike? I search the pile in search of gold, as can happen if an enemy dies, but all I find is bonemeal and bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's voice enters my head again. \"Do not slow, Vestige,\" he says, calling me by some unknown title. \"With the passing of time, any indecision becomes decision.\" His phrases are more like riddles or words of wisdom that you find in fortune cookies. I continue to run down another corridor, following other prisoners, until I come to another door. This time, I'm able to place my hand on the door and feel it's lack of warmth, since it's as freezing as the air around me, and a growing vibration. Again the sides of the door separate from the middle, which again lowers into the floor. Even before the door disappears from the threshold, the voice of the man enters my mind. \"Another enemy blocks the path. Dispatch it quickly,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of ten or so of us enters the room beyond. Again, another mob of skeletons, this time dressed with quivers and bows in their hands stands at the ready paces away. With adrenaline rushing through my veins, I take up my bow again and ready another arrow. Wasting no time, I release an arrow into a skeleton in the middle of the mob. The arrow is able to penetrate and severe the tendon at the shoulder of the right arm, causing it to fall to the floor. My arrow also is able to stagger the enemy, long enough for a brute of a man with dark skin to slice it in half with his battleaxe. With the enemy dying, everyone is somewhat rejuvenated, though judging by their confused or wondrous looks, no one knows what has revitalized them. I too feel it. A little bit of the soreness is gone and I feel a bit more motivation to continue. I cannot explain it, but I do believe everyone has leveled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the skirmish is over, over the cries of short-lived victory, I hear a woman's voice call out. Everyone but me ignores it. \"Whoa there! Are you all right?\" a tall woman who has a pale, though fair complexion runs over to me. \"I heard fighting.\" I approach her after return an arrow to my quiver. She looks me from head to toe and her eyes widen with amazement, though I'm not sure what she is amazed about. \"You've got more meat on your bones than most of these poor bastards. And I see you've armed yourself. Good.\" I look at the bow in my left hand, which on two separate occasions, allowed me to cut down two foes. In reality, I can't say that it's a major achievement. Still the woman before me is unfazed by my own doubt on my feats. \"I hope you've still got some fight left in you. You're going to need it.\" I totally agree with her. This is surely not the end of any combat and to free that man who talks in my head, I would need to cut down more than reanimated skeletons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause to take a breather and then ask the woman, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fellow prisoner. The name's Lyris,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen. I remember the man telling me to find such a woman with that name. I would ask him who she is, but she is right here in the flesh. I cannot let this opportunity go to waste. \"Lyris Titanborn? I was told to find you,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widen as well, even more so as she hears her own name. She's possibly thinking that I had no chance in learning her name in the time it took to transfer me here in this realm. \"What? Who told you to find me?\" she asks, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strange figure appeared in my cell. An old man in rags,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't explain how her eyes could keep getting wider and wider. Her voice is evidence enough of her astonishment. \"The Prophet!\" she exclaims. \"He spoke to you? What did he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediate tell her the shortened-down version of what he told me. \"He said our fates are intertwined,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall Nord woman doesn't seem surprised. She even giggles a bit. i wonder if this Lyris woman knows this Prophet in a more personal way? \"Ha! That sound like the Prophet, all right. He's a prisoner here, too. It was dangerous for him to speak to you, even for a moment. He must think you can help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, I respond with, \"I can still hear his voice in my head. What does he want me to help you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break him out of course,\" she says without an ounce of sarcasm. \"Believe me, I can use all the help I can get. That blind man is the only person alive who can help us get back home. Tamriel's a long way from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the strings of the game controls (at least, that's the way I see it) relinquish their hold on me. No longer am I inclined to speak the words they give me, though the words 'I'll help you' still linger in my mind. Possibly it's the last of the phrase they have given me, but I don't necessarily have to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do I respond to Lyris?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll help,\" I respond to Lyris. Again, her eyes widen and I can sense some of the burden has been lifted off her shoulders. She pulls out a sword from a scabbard she has tied to her waist with no effort at all. I wonder if she inherently had all this strength all along or that my positive response had a hand at rejuvenating her will. She says nothing more, but has a sort of expression on her face that tells me that I'm the one to lead the way. I follow the corridor where other armed prisoners are running and we get to another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it opens, Lyris and I find ourselves in a large room, at least I think it's a room. A thick fog above us acts as a ceiling, but I'm not sure if it hides sharp, cavernous structures or the mimicking sky of this realm. We discover we are at the top of a staircase. Other prisoners, with no caution to potential dangers, rush down the stairs with weapons in hand. Unlike everyone else, Lyris turns to me and after taking a deep breath, she tells me, \"We made it.\" She scouts around her, taking in her surroundings. Then she continues. \"Come. The Sentinels are at the top of those towers. We need to find a way up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to search in the distance for something that resembles a tower, but currently, the thick fog obscures anything faraway. Confused, I ask, \"What are these Sentinels?\" I ask the question without thinking, as if something greater puts the words on my tongue. This has happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical constructs created by Molag Bal to guide his vision in Coldharbour,\" she tells me as she puts away her sword for now. \"The Sentinels are connected. If we destroy one, the others will be blinded. With any luck, that will buy us the time we need to free the prophet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, without thinking, I utter, \"How can we destroy it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've no idea. Brute force? We'll find a way. We have to,\" Lyris responds. She readies her scabbard with her left hand, lifting the hilt of her sword for easy access with her right hand. \"Be ready for anything. I doubt Molag Bal left the Sentinels unguarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" I say simply. Lyris once again unsheathes her sword and waits for me to do the same with my weapon. Again she gives me the look as if I'm to lead and it's her job to follow it. I ready my bow and head down the steps to where chaos ensues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone flame atronach, with blue flames consuming it, is alerted to my presence and vibrates while looking at me. It swings it arm in an effort to throw a hot blue fireball. Surprising myself, I manage to roll out of the wall and knock an arrow once I'm upright. I waste no time in releasing the string, sending an arrow straight into the torso of the Daedra. The arrow lodges itself into the coals and strikes a few embers off, but the atronach is neither stunned nor stumbling. It swings its other arm, sending another fireball towards me. This time I'm not ready for it and as a last ditch effort, I shield my face with my arm, which gets the brunt of the attack. The fireball explodes mildly, its embers sending stinging pain across my arm rather than burning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyris comes to my rescue as I trip backwards as well. She puts herself in between myself and the Daedra and rushes in a berzerk state. A fireball lands on her shoulder, displaying a terrifying mini-explosion of light and ashes, but it doesn't faze Lyris at all. Her speed doesn't decrease, but instead, instead increases, almost two-fold. She singlehandedly swing her sword, cutting deep gashes in the Daedra's torso, as well as a blow to each of its limbs. In its weakened state, the flame atronach hovers low, giving Lyris the ultimate position to slice the head off the Daedra. The creature's limbs and torso disconnect from each other and fall to a heap of ashes on the cavern floor. Lyris walks away, but not before the mass of large coals explodes behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands there unfazed by the potential flying coals hitting her backside. My eyes widen as I lay my eyes on the scene before me. She sports a curious look on her face. \"Looks like you haven't seen something like that before. I figure a Redguard woman like yourself has seen plenty of this in her lifetime,\" she says, pointing out that my expression was totally out of character. Knowing that this is a role-playing game, not to mention a massive multiplayer online game. With a controller or keyboard and a screen to look at, it is easy to take on the role of the character you are controlling. But when you are immersed in the world, interacting with the people living in it, it's hard to draw the line. I don't think you can even draw one when there is an NPC like Lyris involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo defend myself, I respond with, \"I was just impressed that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyris brushes it off with a shrug. She simply says, \"One down, many more to go,\" before helping me to my feet. \"It'd be best to stock up on ammunition. One arrow isn't going to be enough for these enemies. Skeleton's are just skin and bone with weak magic. These are Daedra, a lot more than skin and bones and a whole lot of magic intertwined in these creatures.\" I take her advice to my and get to my feet. I return to the pile of strewn coals and take my arrow from it. Luckily, the heat has not penetrated the inside core of my arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we are down here, out of the thick fog from above, it is easier to see where these Sentinels are located, since they glow atop tower structures and are easily seen, though not all of them are easily accessible. From what I can see, there are three towers, each with this glow at the top of them. The towers that Lyris mentioned was not a complete towering structure, but more like a peak of a hill or mountain, but when seen at a distance, can be mistaken for a tower, due to the dense fog. I pick one of the towers and make a beeline towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter a clearing filled with flame atronachs and as many armed prisoners fighting them. There is no end to the fighting, but I do see people heading up pathways carved around the hills. I follow them into a space cleared out of enemies. When I think we are safe from the Daedras, many more spring up from out of nowhere. With the adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I ready my bow and shoot arrows at the first atronach I see. It hit him in the head, but with no eyes or vital organs to sense anything, it struggles on. Lyris finds openings and hacks away at the clumped up mass of coals, given me time to ready another arrow, which I daringly shoot for a second time, which lands itself in the neck. It becomes the killing blow, giving Lyris enough space to not be caught in the blast of the last-minute Daedric explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and compliments me, \"You're getting good at this.\" I retrieve my arrows and keep pressing on. We would continue for about thirty meters or so, just at the foot of the slope and another mob of Daedra appear and the fighting continues. Prisoners who have caught up join in, making it easier on us and for their benefit, they stick with us until we get within sight of the Sentinel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twice as many Daedra appear, cutting across our direct route to the glow. We simply cannot get to the Sentinel without a fight. How do we go about fighting this battle?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A scrawny prisoner who wields an ax charges towards the large mob without thinking, paying the price by becoming the sole target. Once they sense him, they all aim and shoot a flurry of fireball at him. He dodges about three of the couple dozen, but is engulfed in magical flames, causing him to writhe in utter pain. He screams as his limp body crashes to the floor, his rags and skin burning to a crisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna kill that Molag Bal and Mannimarco for taking all those souls. That little elf was only a kid. Probably only held a sword for a few minutes,\" Lyris says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not going to respawn?\" I ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re-what?\" she asks, clearly not knowing what the word meant. \"He can't die here since his soul's been taken. You could say this is already an afterlife for us prisoners. You will die, but you'll wake up having lost something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuts up as four others charge in with their weapons. She joins them as others do the same. I ready my bow once again and when I find an opening, I take a shot. I land a few shot that knocks the Daedra back, stunning them and one I get a killing bow. After firing, I try to shorten the distance and pick up reusable arrows and shoot them back at the remaining foes. As I'm fighting, I feel myself getting used to this ranged battle. It's as if I have a desire to learn a few tricks or getting better at some skill-related aspects. With the help of others, we manage to defeat all the Daedra, leaving the Sentinel, which is a ball of blue light that looks like an eye from a movie, exposed. I approach the ball of light and pass my hand through the magics. I feel the tingle as if it is filled with static electricity and with a karate chop, I slice my hand away. The Sentinel explodes in a magnificent display of blinding blue light, which only last a couple seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly! While he's blinded, we must get to the Prophet's cell,\" Lyris calls out to me from behind. Already she has made her way down the slope we had just ascended. A lone Daedra waits for us at the middle of the winding slope, which the both of us dispatch with less sword blows and arrows. I can't explain it, but it felt too easy. Maybe I'm stronger now than a few minutes ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prophet's voice whispers into my head, \"The God of Brutality knows of your escape! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe do just that without any more talking. We get down the slope and across a river of blue sludge. We find a much taller staircase that leads away from the hill where we just came from. At the top, we find another of those bladed doors, but with an odd blue aura covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyris curses, \"Herma-Mora's wagging tongue! The door's warded. We'll never get in this way.\" I want to try my hand at doing to the door what I had done with the Sentinel, but something inside me causes me not to. I turn to Lyris. \"Damn it! Destroying the Sentinel must have trigger these wards. We need to find another way in.\" Lyris pauses, looking over the vastness of the realm. \"Hmm. Maybe Cadwell can help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Cadwell?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadwell is the oldest of the Soul Shriven,\" she explains. \"After years of torment, Soul Shriven usually go insane and turn feral, but not Cadwell. He was already insane before he left Tamriel. Mad as box of frogs, but completely harmless. You'll see.\" She somehow says this without a sinister giggle or grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside me causes me to ask, \"How can a mad man possibly help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadwell sees things as he wishes them to be. To him, Coldharbour is a wondrous place. It's his home. And he knows it like the back of his hand,\" Lyris further explains. \"He's usually down by the river. Let's go find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod in agreement, not because the system told me to, even though I was prompted with the phrase, 'Let's find this Cadwell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my way down the staircase, not even becoming winded when I make it to the bottom. At the bottom, another prisoner cuts me off and runs down a direction where raggedy tarps have been brought up to make a sort of partition. More of these tarps lead down the same direction the prisoner was running off to and I find him at a campfire. Despite the freezing air, the fire is bustling with hot coals. Around the fire stands other prisoners, a couple of them wagging their bodies to a sorry excuse for a rhythm. The sound is coming from a man seat at the fire. Upon closer inspection, he wears an iron kettle on his head like a hat and in his hands he plays a bard's lute. He sings a tune that has no structure and is like a instantly-conjured up poem with no meaning. Then again, he is insane, this Cadwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to within talking distance (or enough distance that he would notice me) and he greets me with a British accent, like the one a certain comedic actor I know has. \"Hello, what's this? Out for a stroll, then? Lovely day for it,\" he says. I look up and find a glimpse of a burning sky through what was for a moment, a thin patch of the ever-present dense fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Cadwell,\" I say as I look back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Cadwell, yes indeed. A pleasure,\" he affirms that he is in fact the insane man who finds this realm a wondrous place. \"And fair Lyris! Good to see you, m'dear! How are you, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to Lyris, but find that she is rather annoyed with the man. I figure she'd wished to get this conversation running along before she goes insane just listening to his ignorant blabbering. I speak to prevent Lyris from having to speak herself. \"We're trying to get inside the Prophet's enclosure. The door is sealed,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, oh dear. Well, that is inconvenient, isn't it?\" he says, which I deem is a mere joke about the seriousness of the situation. \"Tell you what--I happen to know another way in! Much more of a scenic route. Rather a fun little jaunt, actually. Full of traps, and corpses, and nasty beasties filling up the bits in between.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we get through all that?\" I ask, but not with a sense that the game is giving me words to responds with. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather cautiously, I expect,\" he tells me, this time without that ounce of joking in his voice. \"Watch your step, hold your nose, and do mind the traps. There'll like as not be a fair dose of running and skull-bashing as well.\" I think I like this jaunt, I mean joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no doubt it won't be a walk in the park, otherwise, Molag Bal would tell us exactly where it is, or at the very least, give us a general direction or taken off some wards. \"Where's the entrance?\" I ask Kettle-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow the river. You'll find the door to the Undercroft at the water's end. Once you're inside, stick to the light and you'll find a ladder that will take you right up to the Prophet, straightaway,\" Cadwell explains the route we should take. As a parting, he tells me, \"Do give him my best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best of luck. Do check in now and again, won't you?\" he suggests. Knowing that we would have to deal with the Daedric Prince sooner or later, I have no doubt we will see Cadwell in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I'm in no rush and since Cadwell know so much about Coldharbour, I ask him a question about its denizens. Well, forced-denizens. \"How do you know Lyris?\" I ask. I don't even bother to look back at the possible annoyed expression the Nord woman has behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadwell seems delighted to answer the question. \"Ah, Lyris. Girl's as mad as Sheogorath's jammies. Heart's in the right place, I suppose. Says she's got to rescue the Prophet to save us all from eternal torment. How an old man could do that is quite beyond me,\" he explains, much to Lyris' audible annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI press on, asking him, \"What do you know about the Prophet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he is delighted as ever to answer further questions. \"An Imperial gentleman. Apparently, he was once a powerful mage, but the years haven't been kind,\" he tells me, pausing just a bit to wipe his dry nose and look to his right. As he does so, he kettle droops down his head towards the handle, which he nonchalantly raises with his right hand. When he's done, he lowers his hand and strums an out-of-tune melody on the lute's strings. \"Lyris says he knows a path back to Tamriel. I rather think that if one existed, I'd have found it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask him, \"You don't think there's a way to get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't actually given it much thought. Anything's possible, I suppose,\" he explains. \"Truth is, I've been here so long, this place feels like home. But a good uprising now and again is a pleasant diversion., so where's the harm, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though I'm itching to get on my way, I ask him a question that the game had prompted me a while ago, but it had prompted me the previous question a fraction of a second after that. \"Tell me about yourself, Sir Cadwell,\" I say, adding the honorific to enlighten the mood. I glance back at Lyris, but she is not having any fun at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, Cadwell answers, \"Well, there's not much to tell, is there? It's the same old pish-tosh. Gallant knight, epic quests, rescued maidens.\" I can tell it's a joke. \"I came to this land when my head was quite unceremoniously separated from my body. Bad luck that, but you make the best of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyris' hand impatiently runs up and down the hilt of her sword. Thinking she could wait through a couple more conversations, I ask, \"How long have you been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, quite a long time. In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if I were the oldest of the Soul Shriven. Of those that didn't go feral, that is,\" he tells me. For a moment, I wonder if I've ever met a feral Soul Shriven. I've only seen dead prisoners since emerging from my cell. \"I know every tunnel and path, every nook and cranny. The other look up to me, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing left to say and no further prompts from the game, I can bid farewell to Cadwell. Do I? Or should I ask him more question? Our conversations have proven that he knows an extensible knowledge of the realm, among other matters. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I bid farewell to the amusing Cadwell, who acknowledges it with a slight nod and a slight grin. It's as if he knows we will see him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see a portion of the blue sludgy river beyond his encampment and follow it. It flows into a small canyon, again filled with traps, corpses and flame atronachs, which we quickly dispatches with our growing skills. I somehow level up yet again and even once more at the end of the Undercroft. I put my newfound skills towards finding a better way to knock the arrow and increasing the tension in the string as I pull it back farther and farther. I come to a conclusion that I would need to exchange this sorry excuse of a bow with something better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyris and I eventually get to a ladder. Just like Cadwell said, at the top is a hatch, that when opened, brings us to a large room. I can hear the hum of electricity, though at the moment I think it's electricity. \"The Prophet's cage should be just ahead. Quickly, now! We haven't much time,\" Lyris says and she runs further into the room. I discover the Prophet's cage is not really the birdcage that I thought it would be. His cage is actually a giant prism of a cell that glows blue with magic. It spins with an ominous hum. No way I would escape from that if I were in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyris dashes to a pedestal which sits right in front of the space that the cage is in. I look up and see a spire, which with two streams of blue magic, contains the force that holds the Prophet in. Lyris turns around and speaks, \"All right, the good news is, we made it here in one piece and the Prophet looks unharmed.\" With good news, always comes bad news. I'm sure of that. \"Now, the bad news. It's going to be up to you to keep him safe and get him back to Tamriel. I'm not going with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Where are you going?' I ask, even though the game had prompted me to. Lyris is going to put responsibility in my hands now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I probably should have mentioned this before., but it never seemed like the right time,\" she tells me out of the blue. Anytime when we were fighting those Daedra in the Undercroft would have been a good time! \"There's a trick to opening the cell. The only way for a prisoner to leave is for another living soul to take their place. I need to swap places with the Prophet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont do this, Lyris. There must be another way!\" I exclaim with full emotion. I guess getting into character is pretty easy if you put your mind to it. I guess the emotion came from the fact that I'm trading a strong Nord woman with a skill in swordsmanship for an old man who speaks into my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lyris has already made up her mind. She reassures me, \"Believe me, I wish there was. But... I don't see anyone else here with a beating heart, do you?\" I pause to think up the plan to get a prisoner to trade places, but in actuality, that prisoner may be another player like me. I don't think that player would want to spend an indefinite amount of time in the Prophet's cell. \"If Molag Bal isn't stopped he'll destroy everyone and everything we've ever loved.\" She pauses to put reassuring hands on my shoulders. \"The Prophet chose you for a reason. Get him to safety, I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath, knowing the ball is in my court now. The burden is on my shoulders. I take one last deep breath and look Lyris in the eye. \"I'll keep him safe,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removes her hands from my shoulders and goes back to the pedestal. Out loud she tells me, \"There are magical locking devices on either side of the cage. You need to deactivate both of them so I can begin the transfer.\" She points to both with her hands. They are the ones streaming magic or whatever force to the center spire above the cage. \"Once it's done, get moving. The Prophet will know where to go, but he'll need your eyes, and your protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod in affirmation, saying, \"I understand. Good luck.\" She gives me a similar nod of affirmation and turns her full attention to the pedestal. I run over to one of the lock and place my hand on it. I break the beam of magic until the cage makes another ominous hum, as if a lock is disengaging itself. I do the same to the opposite lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done, i return to Lyris, who, with a determined expression and attitude about herself, she shouts, \"I give myself, that the Prophet might be free!\" She does this with her arms out to her sides, as if she is offering herself to the cage. She is enveloped by light and rings of electricity bound around her. The sword and scabbard attached to her side falls and clatters to the floor. She is then lifted off her feet and is held to hover just a foot above the ground. The whole room vibrates and rumbles as Lyris disappears from sight and in a puff of smoke, in her place, stands the Prophet, staff and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath to speak to him, but he speaks before me. \"Thank the Divines, you are safe! There is that, at least,\" he says to me, though not knowing exactly where I am in front of him. I observe his eyes are almost completely white. The Prophet is blind? Maybe that's why Lyris told me he needed my eyes. \"Lyris sacrificed everything, that we might go free. Her sacrifice must not be in vain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we find a way to take her with us?\" I ask as I walk over to the fallen sword in its scabbard. I unsheathed it and find the ash from previous encounters with the flame atronachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that were possible. But I promise you, once we escape Coldharbour we will find a way to rescue her together, Vestige,\" he reassures me, adding an honorific (at least I find it honorable) at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vestige?' I ask him what the title means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the name I have given you. You are but a trace of your former self. A soulless one. An empty vessel that longs to be filled,\" he explains the meaning. That being said, this avatar I'm using doesn't even have a name yet. When we get out of this place, it'll be the first thing I do. \"Is is as the Scrolls foretold, but not as exactly as I imagined.\" I wonder if he's seen an Elder Scroll and paid for it with his eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother prompt from the game has me asking, \"Why does Lyris call you the Prophet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exclaims as if angry. It's as if he has been asked the question many times and has just now become annoyed at how many times he's been queried. \"That is what I have come to be called. My true name is lost, even to me. Years of torment has taken their toll,\" he shouts. He takes a moment to collect himself. \"Quickly now, we must make hast to the Anchor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take a prompt from the game to get me curious enough to say, \"Anchor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Anchors are Daedric machines of the darkest magic. Their charms bind our world and pull it towards Coldharbour,\" the Prophet explains. \"I can use one of these Anchors to return us to Tamriel, but you must lead me to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Stay close then,\" I tell him, but wonder how he will even keep up, seeing that he's blind and needs guiding. In any case, I make my way to the opposite end of the room, opposite the way Lyris and I came in from the Undercroft. I look back and discover that the Prophet isn't blind at all. I bet years of being blind has garnered him the ability to use his other senses, which have grown more sensitive over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to a door and place my hands on it. It opens and in it I find a large room with tiny passageways littered around what looks like another pedestal or place where a cell goes. In the very center is what looks like a black ball of magic. I steer away from it and into a tiny passageway, only to find a bunch of urns. I take a look and find an assortment of random items. Among the loot, I find notable items such as lockpicks and a curious looking hand of bananas. Maybe I'll take it with me and eat along the way. Funny though, I have never had any desire to eat anything aside from needing to fight Daedra and make my way to the Prophet. With all of that done, maybe I can take a break and taste these bananas. Then again, they may be the freshest bananas on the outside, but on the inside they are too gross to swallow. What should I do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having come to the conclusion that the bananas make look good to eat on the outside, but on the inside, they are way beyond rotten, I toss the bananas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to the other side of the room, away from the ball of black magic and up a short flight of steps to another door. I look behind me and find that the Prophet has done a good job in avoiding the center as well. With his staff in hand, he is able to catch up to me in no time. I place my hand on the door and open it, revealing an large room beyond it. More urns and even a chest is present in the small foyers before going into the main part of the room. I check them to find basic loot, which I keep in a curious pocket that is never shallow. I know that I had just stuff about ten lockpicks and a potion in there. Maybe the inventory is not realistic in this game. Not as real as I would expect at this point on my journey out of Coldharbour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm done perusing the urns, I step into the main part of the room. Almost immediately, skeletons suddenly appear in the room and start shooting magic at me. I unsheathe the sword from its scabbard and dodge the incoming fireballs and try my hand at swinging the sword at the enemies. I cut down one and then another, but the second one manages to burn me. Luckily, and to my surprise, the Prophet extends his staff towards me and a blue beam of healing magic heals the burns and gives me strength. Enough strength to subdue the next eight skeletons that appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all enemies have been reduced to a pile of bones, the whole room rumbles and a large column of blue light emanates from the center of a room, as if to meet with the large ominous ring floating above it. A voice speaks, and it's not from the Prophet. A pair of monstrous, ethereal hands appear from the floor and out of the ground rises a towering creature with horns on its head. It is like a ghost in appearance, but it seems that the voice belongs to it. \"I am the face of pain! The souls of the damned are my weapons! You will know eons of suffering!\" it shouts as if continues to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI back away as it raises its hands and blue magic emanates from them. The Prophet manages to grab ahold of my wrist, preventing me from escaping. In his defense, he tells me, \"Come, I will protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue magic is actually what the form uses to switch from a ethereal form to a physical one. It becomes what could resemble a towering  golem made up of undead flesh and bones. The hideous head of the beast sits upon two broad shoulders. I ready my bow and with my swift skills, I'm able to land all of the arrows, but it's no use after I deplete my quiver of them. I switch to my sword, which proves devastating for the first half of my fight. I have to learn how to hold it right, at what angle to strike and other tricks like dodging and countering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the hang of it, I manage to lay several more blows to the giant, all while the Prophet heals me constantly. He cannot mend the dress that is ruined by the beast's scratches. I just hope when I get to the  real world, I'll be wearing something decent. The finishing blow, comes after I tumble back, successfully dodging the beast's forward attempt to grab me. I find my footing and lunge toward it with the sword. The tip penetrates its flesh and as it continues to sink into the torso, the beast writhes in pain. He screams and falls back, limp with no life within. \"You are the face of pain? Please,\" I say to the corpse as I sheathe the sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prophet speaks right behind me, \"The Dark Anchor's portal is high above us. I will prepare a spell to lift us to it.\" I take a few breathes as he does so. I also discard the dress that is nothing more than a pile of rags. I see the dark skin of my Redguard heritage and the undergarments that support my breasts and hide my crotch. I'm definitely getting some new clothes back in Tamriel, I say to myself. \"But first, you must re-attune yourself to Nirn in order to regain your physical form. To do this, you will need a Skyshard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyshard?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shard of Aetherial magicka that carries the essence of Nirn. Some link them to Lorkhan, the missing god of creation,\" the Prophet explains. Explains why I was able to be in Aetherius, but not accepted into any of its realms. \"If you collect and absorb its power, it should restore your corporeal form. I will summon one of these shards for you to absorb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready,\" I simply say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prophet runs over to a spot near a dias without much effort and then raises his staff to the ceiling. A whirlwind and light, which I believe is the manifestation and movement of magicka, appear around the Prophet. He calls out, \"Shard of Aetherius, fall upon us now and anoint us with your blessing.\" A small tremor is felt and then in a dazzling light, a rock appears on the dias before us. \"There. Quickly. Collect the Skyshard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run over and place my hands on it. It dematerializes into tiny bits of light and with a similar gust of wind, the pieces bombard my body with themselves. I feel myself becoming more whole, if that can be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" the Prophet exclaims and with another short tremor, an upheaval of wind blows from the ground to the ceiling. The Prophet somehow knows that the portal has been activated. He calls out above him. \"Great Akatosh! Dragon God of Time! Your children are lost in this fog between worlds! They cry out for mercy! Hear my voice Akatosh! I require your strength! Let the way be opened! Let these wandering souls return home! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied!\" He calls back to me. \"Hurry, we must go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashes up the steps and jumps into the wind, which takes him higher and higher. Without thinking, I do the same, up the steps and into the wind. I scream at the top of my lungs as the gusts lift me high until my eyes see not a ceiling, but that same tunnel I saw when I first came here. My vision then goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, where do I find myself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I don't know how long I'm out, but once my vision had turned black, my body felt different. No longer was I being uplifted by a strong updraft. I was still, and on my stomach no less. I open my eyes and find my face buried in a soft pillow. I discover myself in a bed and almost instantly, realize that I'm naked. At least there is a sheet covering me, which prevents me from panicking. I'm actually too sore to panic, for every muscle in my body and probably my bones too are hurting. At least I'm alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hits me. No longer am I in the freezing realm of Coldharbour. The sheets, the mattress underneath me, even the warm breeze coming from the open window is sure signs I'm in the real world. That real world is Tamriel. So I'm still in the game. I did not pass out while playing it. I was in it. Experiencing it. And with this rather attractive body, I'm playing as a female avatar with golden brown skin no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room teeters back and forth and I'm confused as to why. I'm not even on my feet. I sit up, feeling a headache throb about my temples and cover myself with the sheet. I swing my legs over to the side and slowly lower myself to the floor. I further wrap the sheet over my body and make my way to a window that is open. What I see is a wondrous sight. Blue as far as I can see, topped with white as it folds onto itself. A large expanse of ocean, though it does not dominate my view. Further to my right, land meets the water and judging by how there are constructs made of wood and rope, I can suppose I'm on a ship that is currently docked on a pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool breeze blows through, chilling me through the bone, reminding me terribly of how cold it was in Coldharbour. I look behind me and find sitting on a chair next to the bed is a pile of clothes and a pair of boots sitting on the floor right next to the chair. I first check the door and make sure the latch is fastened so that no one can get in while I dress myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the pile, I find seven pieces of clothing. First are the undergarments, which look the same as the ones I wore in Coldharbour, though these feel clean, as if they had been washed. The outer garments I find is a pair of pants, a sleeveless shirt with an attached fur hood, a pair of gauntlets with attached fingerless gloves and the aforementioned boots, all made of dark brown leather. The inside of the garment are lined with fur, though more so with the shirt. I also find a crimson cloak that can attach to pins located on the shoulders of the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make haste and put on the garments. I rather not think who undressed me or who washed my underwear. I just want to make a mental note to thank them later. I wonder if this benevolent person is either an NPC with a generous source of compassion or another player, who remains anonymous. Coming into this game, I had only one friend who had told me that he was going to play the game, but as for which faction and what race he would be, he did not say. I wonder if I'll come across him one day. I just hope that he isn't trapped in this game like I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on the undergarments are no hassle, save for the brassiere, since in this world, no one has been industrious enough to create hooks to fasten the back of the bra. Instead of hooks, a simple braided cord is used to fasten the undergarment much like a bikini would. I would go without it, but after inspecting the shirt, I find that it would only cover the top half of my torso, leaving much of my abdomen exposed. Who's sick joke in letting someone they rescued wear a coat like this? If this is the work of a NPC, I sure would like to shoot an arrow through his knee. If this was the doing of a actual player, even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes, maybe a bit longer, I manage to fasten the bra onto my body and make sure it's tight too. I'm surprised at how flexible the arms on this body is. No way could I have managed it with bulky arms of a man. Once the undergarments are on, I slip my shapely legs into the pants. As I do, I immediately feel the comfort of the inside lining of the pants. It's soft like fur, though not as bulky. When they are fully on, they accentuate the shape of my calves, my thighs, my buttocks and even my thin waist. I'm even surprised at the range of motion I have. i can possibly run at my faster in these pants. I finish the bottom off by slipping my feet into the warm fur boots. The outside leather is smooth, almost like suede and excess fur comes out of the insides of the boots. Though, upon closer inspection, thin strings are connected to the top part of the boot so as to tighten it so that if it rains, the fur doesn't get wet, therefore, preventing my feet from getting wet. The strings are stretchy enough so I can connect them to my pants, which provided rings to tie the strings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move on to the shirt, which is easy enough to get on. The coat no doubt exposes my midriff, but it's comfortable enough that I don't even bother covering it. A leather belt, which is used to tightly fasten the coat onto my person, does it job in further supporting my bust and gives me security that any acrobatic move won't allow for an unnecessary slip of my breasts. The inside lining is of a thicker fur, though it's as soft as the lining of the pants. The attached hood too gives comfort as well as the benefit of not getting my hair wet. In fact, I find my hair is more fine and voluminous, not like the knotted and frail hair I had in Coldharbour. I do believe this is my body in this world, but my run-in with that elf with that dagger had given me a scar that I notice is hidden underneath the lower part of the shirt. If I bend back, I'm pretty sure the shirt will rise and expose the scar. I'm pretty sure a lot of people have the scar after their run-in with Molag Bal and his worshippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move on to the gauntlets, which have attached gloves that are fingerless. I could suppose this is to have better traction with a bow, which I don't find in the room at all. I guess all the weapons I took from Coldharbour stayed in that freezing realm. That said, I better go out and find me some weapons to work with. I fasten the gauntlets with the belts and buckles provided. Once they are snugly fitted onto my arm, I lastly go for the cloak, which for the most part, can cover my exposed midriff as well as the rest of my body. Once dressed, I immediately go for the door. I unlatch it and pull it open. I'm startled by a person standing  right outside the door. Who does it happen to be?</span></div></div>",

His volume is as if he is floating right in front of me. Loud enough for my ears to hear, but not too loud as to break my ear drums, if I had any. \"This alliance puts sophisticated culture above militaristic prowess and charm and economics. I hear the Altmer, or \"High Elves\" or True Elves as they call themselves, have come out of hiding and form relationships with two lower races, the Wood Elves and the Khajiit. They want to protect their sophisticated culture from the younger races it seems. They seek not riches or glory, but wisdom, which has come from age, which the younger races lack. Say, you must be a member of the High Elves, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's as if he's introducing me into the game, like how the Elder Scrolls games are like. First they present you with an interface to create a custom character. It's as specific as what race you are, what class you'll be and even what gender. I have felt that going the male route is too obvious and found that playing as a female character makes the character creation experience feel like new again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Altmer, or High Elves as they are called mostly, are a race of Mer who believe they are descended from the gods and make themselves superior to all the other races. They are elegant and sophisticate, almost like royalty. and as many can guess, are very proficient with magic. They live in the Summerset Isles, which is made up of three main islands: Summerset, Auridon and Artaeum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be welcome in Aetherius with your affinity of magic, if you were Atlmer. If you're not a High Elf, then you must be the lowly elven race, Bosmer,\" he says and then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bosmer, though lowly to a an Altmer, is not low as in status, but low in regards to their ability to sneak and use stealth, in my opinion. I have always enjoyed their affinity to bows and to animals, which they can, for a short period, control any animal they encounter and command it to do their bidding. Out of all the elven races, Wood Elves are known to be the only Mer race to have a sense of humor. Their proficiency in stealth as well as nimble acts of acrobatics and prowess in ranged combat is much suitable to the near-impenetrable forests of Valenwood, where they call home. Valenwood is heavily domination by forests, though some ruins of the Ayleid race dot the landscape, probably overgrown by the foliage and vines. Rain is a common sight, which nourish the rainforests and swamps. The Bosmer live in bulbous homes in the empty cavities of enlarged trunks of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the Altmer, the Bosmer's way of life, which is connected to their homeland, is under the threat of the other alliances. Tradition has seeped into their roots, so to speak. But if you're not a Wood Elf, then you must be a Khafiit,\" he says once more and again, asks if I'm of the last race mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Khajiit are humanoid cats with tails of one to boot. Like the reptilian Argonians, these humanoid cats are one of the beast races in Elder Scrolls. They ae known for their natural agility and stealth and also are known for their traveling merchant caravans. They are also known to trade, manufacture and enjoy the suspicious substance called Moon Sugar, which they refine into a beverage called Skooma. Most believe they are thieves and are not as easily trusted. Khajiit make their home in the province of Elsweyr, which comprises of two halves, both control by different parties. The north is like Hammerfell, home of the Redguards, where it has a sort of badlands landscape or desert. The south on the other hand, is like the jungle or rainforests of Valenwood, home of the Bosmer, and Black Marsh, where the Argonians reside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear the fur of many Khajiit litter the battlefieds, though you may not be one, since you have no soul to begin with. Very suspicious indeed. My curiosity, or should I say, my patience is wearing thin. Which one of these races are you?\" he asks finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich race should I become?</span></div></div>",

It start to become weird when the lights in my room turn off by themselves as well as the lights outside burn out. Even my vision blurs and eventually it too goes out. I don't feel myself fall and for a few seconds, I only see the absence of light. What's going on? The only explanation I can think of is that an electro-magnetic pulse is unleased on the city I live in, and in the chaos, something outside my body causes me to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, I start to gain my feeling again. Immediately, I feel a jolt of movement, as if the foundations of my house shake due to a small tremor. I feel like I'm in a bed, yet it's smaller than what I remember is my own. My ears gain their ability to catch sounds and the initial sound I hear is a faint whistle, like the wind is blowing outside my window. I start to feel a constant vibration, as if there is just enough energy in a tremor to create this vibration. I open my eyes for the first time, but what I'm feeling, what I'm hearing does not match what I'm seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up in a small compartment. A window is right next to the small mattress I'm sleeping on and I see a vast desert with a red orange hue on the rocks. I remember this play in the first ever Forza Horizon, but this new game was supposed to put us in various places that the Horizon Festival is held in. Did they also give us all First Person Perspectives and made us have the ability to create avatars separate from drivatars? And how am I playing this without a controller?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what I can see, the train is heading for a city in the distance. It still has quite a ways to go. I get out of bed only to discover something different. I am my own avatar, but I assumed that it was going to default me as a man. What's weird and awkward at the same time is that I see the body of a woman. My limbs, my torso, even the silky flowing hair that falls from my head is that of a woman. I get out of bed and of course, see a woman in the reflection of the mirror. Funny thing is, that I find myself attractive. As a man playing a woman, I see this girl in front of me and I'm impressed that this is my avatar. There is nothing I want to change, and so much more I want to do. But why am I on this train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic emits from an unseen speaker and a friendly voice speaks addressing all the passengers on the train. He tells us that we are within five miles to the station where they will do a lengthy unloading of people, luggage and vehicles. He also reminds everyone that if anybody has not received at least a yellow wristband, to make their way to the Horizon Heats, where a car will be provided. He finishes by welcoming everyone to the Global Horizon Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of engines direct my attention from the speaker, which turns off after a second of static, to the window. I get on the bed and press my face into the window and see where the noise is coming from. A Lamborghini and a Ferrari races each other on a dusty road adjacent to the train tracks. At the train's current speed, the moving cars seem to be standing still before us passengers watching. The passenger windows of each car open and a hand stretches out of each. In each hand, a flare has been ignited. Red smoke billows out of the Ferrari, while blue smoke puffs out of the flare of the Lamborghini. The two cars follow the road down, descending to who knows where, out of our sight. I can hear cheers and shouts coming from the compartments next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look towards the horizon and see what looks like an entire fairgrounds have been filled with what looks like an actual festival. Though I cannot hear it through the roar of the train and the window that protects me from the heat of the weather outside, I imagine the festival has it own set of booming sounds. I can see thousands of people filling up every cranny of the place. Numerous stages have been set where performances are held. A carnival of sorts springs up in the distance and I can see more and more instances of people racing in and around the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the train slows to a stop at the station. Once ground to a halt, the activity in the train cars start to increase as the unboarding and unloading commences. I take one last look around to see that I don't leave anything in the compartment. I grab a backpack from a shelf above me, which I reach for with an arm with a wristband tied around my wrist. It's pink. If I can recall, the last time I played the game was when it was in Italy. The pink wristband was the last wristband I ever received before I stopped playing the game. Somehow, my console must have remembered my save information and allowed me to start where I left off. Yet, somehow, I am in a female avatar now, with a whole bunch of sensations that I'm not familiar with. Did the console allow this to happen as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intercom blasts with static again and instead of the conductor of the train speaker, a woman speaks, reminding everyone of what the conductor previously said. She adds that if one already has a wristband, they must get themselves to the unloading dock to retrieve their vehicle. I wonder what vehicle I would get. Would it be one that has been predetermined and out of my control? Would it be a stock version like the ones presented to players who start a new game? Or would it be the car that I had used previously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my way out of the compartment and eventually off the train. I am amazed by all of the activity on the platform. Many people of different races and genders populate the area. Signs that read with an arrow pointing to the direction of the unloading dock and valet area are posted on nearby post. A number of people who have wristbands already make their way towards the direction the arrows are pointing to, which seems to be towards the rear of the train. I follow them as the intercom blares again with the female speaker giving out more information. She informs everyone that hotel rooms are given out to those who have a certain color wristband. Yellow wristband will have a room at a certain hotel in the city while green wristbands will be given a room at a different hotel and so on. Might be a way to get people of the same rank and skill to start gathering with other people in the same bracket so that the playing field is level. To be honest, it's a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make to a number of lines before a security gate. People who do not have a wristband try to get through, but the attendant with scanners turn them away since they have nothing to scan. When it gets to my turn, the man smiles and scans my wristband and allows me to enter through the turnstile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the heat of the desert air to the cool of an air-conditioned unloading dock that has numerous vehicles of every shape and size being driven onto lift that bring them to the floor of the building, I follow the mass of people to huge waiting room, that looks like it might have been a DMV of sorts. People entering must have their wristbands scanned once more to get a ticket and must wait for their ticket to be called. Several monitors with up to ten ticket numbers on the screens are mounted on every wall. Every minute or so a new number pops up and someone from many seated in the room stands and goes out the door to the lot that the monitor tell he or she to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a seat in a vacant chair and wait for my ticket number to pop up. After about ten minutes of waiting, my ticket number is show on the screen and it directs me to go to lot A. I stand and make my way outside to the right lot. Conveniently, Lot A is immediately outside the door. An attendant stands with a clipboard on the curb calling out the names of people, which is actually the screen-name of the player. He calls them out with such accuracy that on some people's faces, I see an expression of shock. As if they ask in their minds, \"How does he know to pronounce it like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant shouts my name with such accuracy that I too am shocked to hear it. I'm not even down the ramp when I hear him call it out. I approach him and he addresses me with the name and then asks, \"Is there another name you'd like to be referred by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is tall and his stature reminds me that I'm not a man in this world ,so I shouldn't give him a name that belongs to a man. I should pick a woman's name. But what should I choose? After a few seconds of deliberating, I answer, \"Racquel Ibanez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Miss Ibanez, your car is just pulling up now,\" the attendant says and points his hand to my car which drives out of the gated area and turns towards the curb and into an empty space. Just what kind of car have I received?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The car I see brings back memories. Some of the initial memories are those that when I was using the car, it was too fast and thus too uncontrollable. The memories after that is those of tuning the car and decorating it to my liking. It was tuned for acceleration at the expense of a low top speed, but it was under my control. The same design I had on it, which was a two-tone paintjob of off-white and carbon fiber, looks much better with the graphics I see with my eyes. It looks as if it was a real car from real life. An attendant exits the car and keeps the driver's side door open to allow me to enter it. He gestures with his hands to direct me to the cockpit of this wonderful machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun and welcome to the Global Horizon Festival,\" the attendant says to me as I enter the car. He closes the door and rushes back to the lot to retrieve another car. I quickly adjust the seat so that with my new female avatar, I can see over the hood and reach the pedals. After adjusting my seat, I press the brake pedal and disengage the clutch to put the car into gear. After the gear has been engaged, I press the gas and initially go into an exciting state of shock at how powerful the response is. Fortunately there is nothing in my way to crash into. Seems like others are having the same issues of a newbie like me and struggle to even make it out of the driveway. For others, it's no problem and they roar their engines and screech their tires and peel out of the driveway to the street. It seems the latter have driven cars seriously while the former are only used to controllers they hold in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I manage better than other and I drive my GTR safely out of the lots and driveways to the streets. It's there when I see attendants on the sidewalks with signs that direct us to accommodations and housing for players. I pull into the lot and into an empty space. An attendant already walks over and I roll down my window. She holds out a scanner and scans my wristband and out of a machine that's attached to her belt, she pulls out what seems to be a ticket. She hands it to me and tells me that the people with pink wristbands have hotel rooms in a certain hotel. The ticket she gives me is a small version of a confirmation of a reservation, which I should use to get keycards to my room. She also hands me an earpiece that is hands-free so that I can better get in touch with race official and other important people at the festival, probably other racers that I have gotten in contact with as well. She informs me that I can pair the piece with the phone I have in my bag. She also hands me some cards of basic information and a map of the festival hubs in the area. Once all the materials have been handed over, she welcomes me to the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull out of the lot, but before I even make it onto the street, another driver in a Lamborghini Aventador cuts me off and I blow my horn at him. He doesn't stick around and runs a red light almost sending NPC cars into an accident. I check the street to find someone is a Pagani Huayra designed with a unique paintjob that reminds me so someone I know who had the same car. He flashes his lights and let me get into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and relax and make my way to the address on the piece of paper. The GPS directs me to a tall hotel building of white and glass. A pink Horizon Festival banner has been draped over the top of the building, possibly to let people faraway know where the hotel the pink wristbands stay at. I drive into the valet driveway and stop my car. A valet dressed in a red vest and dress slacks hurries over as I put the car in park and open the door to get out. I grab my back and the materials that the attendant gave to me and allow the valet to get in and drive my car away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people don't know when to quit,\" a voice says out loud behind me. I turn around and see a man leaning against the same Huayra that let me get out into the street. \"They still think this is a game, when it's so much more.\" The man raises his face, which is doggone handsome, even in my male opinion. His eyes are hidden behind his shades, which adds to the mystery of his identity. \"Looking good Rizz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRizz was a short nickname most people who I player with called me since it was the first syllable of the proper pronunciation of my screen-name. When he addresses me as such, more memories of when I last played the game is triggered in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe adds, \"It was a shame I couldn't find that R35 after you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen when I figure out who he is. No wonder his car looks so familiar. He was actually my friend on the last console and in this game, he was a good racer. \"Rocket? Is that you?\" I ask, glancing at the flame-theme dancing about his hypercar. He smiles with white, pearly teeth and my joy blows through the roof. What are the chances out of millions of players playing this game right now that i would find a friend who I played with? \"Oh my god, I can't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't believe it. I've been in this game for a week now and I haven't seen my buddies come off the train. That why I've been waiting at the lots for someone that's even distantly recognizable. When I say that carbon fiber GTA in the same design I remember come out of that lot, I just had to see for myself. So I followed you. Looks like my hunches were on the dot,\" he says. \"But this game brings much more than fast cars and the speed under their hoods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for me to figure out, \"I know. Is this even possible that we are no longer that default white guy behind the wheel of our cars?\" I ask rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say it's very possible. And if I may add, you look pretty cool. Is this how you portray yourself in your games?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. If it were possible in the last games, I would have chosen the same,\" I tell him. Somehow I don't even feel embarrassed to know that Rocket remembers that my voice was male and that I was indeed someone with a dick between his legs. I'm surprised to find that he is somewhat surprised at my new look. \"But wait, you said you were here for a week now? You mean you got the game early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks me off of the driveway and onto the sidewalk. \"The reason why, I can't tell you. It might get me or some people in trouble. What I can tell you is yes. Since I was here early, I already have a room at another hotel. If you want, you can cancel that you have and room with me. The suite I have has a spare bedroom you can take. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I take up on the offer of a friend who I just met? Or should I decline and check into my own room? Or should I ask what are his intentions other than giving me a room?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They said they were going to do the same as what they did with their last game, Mirror's Edge Catalyst. Instead of making a sequel to the first game, Catalyst was to be a predecessor to the first game, to establish the setting that would more or less become Mirror's Edge. Their new game, Mirror's Edge Stimuli was to do the same, this time put the gameplay of parkour and free-running in a world and society as similar as today's. It's an act to establish what could've happened decades before the first game. Then, it's a totalitarian society, whereas today, is along the lines of most people having a mediocre degree of freedom. Where tracers or enthusiasts of our sport are labeled as rogues and extreme athletes, not the target of law enforcement, though with this new game, it proves to bring freerunners closer to that fine line between daring athletes and outright criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise of an open world becomes very literal. With technology, city topography is mixed with virtual nonfictional manifestations of places where the general public or city mapping hasn't ventured. In a sense, the whole elevation above the surface and depth beneath the surface of the known world today was put into the game. Buildings and structures we know today can be touched and ascended. Subways, sewers, and tunnels can be utilized as well. The only limits in this game is where parkour cannot dominate: the ocean. But that won't stop us taking boats and planes overseas to use our skills on global cliffs both man-made and natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the game had blind release, which only involved leaks through word of mouth instead of screenshots and gameplay videos, the hardcore like myself didn't let that deter us from buying the game and installing it on our consoles. We all patiently waited until the release of the game came out and the hold on the game was taken off. Predictions made by developers and game enthusiasts alike thought the massively multiplayer online aspect of the game, when paired with the blind release of software and hardware capability of console and megaserver, turned out to be very negative, thinking the game would receive multiple crashes that would delay the playability of the game to extend to up to two weeks laters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not the experience we players had. Instead of the game crashing, something crashed entirely. The intro into the game was seamless and the loading screen was only a few seconds long. A bright white light that was so radiant, it dared to jump from the TV screen in my living room and envelop the whole room itself, including myself. Then that light faded into a darkness. Not even a hint of light shone on my couch or my coffee table. There was no TV. It was just me and void, though only for a brief moment. Then as sudden as the light came, I now found myself in a different position. Instead of sitting in a gaming chair in a living room, I was....where?</span></div></div>",

My female voice grunts and I look up at the one who had grabbed me. It's a man, whose face looked like it is masked with the darkness of the night. Not even the light from the various neon signs can illuminate his face. With one hand he has prevented me from plummeting to my certain death and with his other, he places a piece of paper in a fold on my sleeve. He lifts his head and I suddenly assume that he's looking at me. I look back, calmly, to a place where his eyes might be looking back at me. He speaks, telling me, \"Don't look back. Get to the drop point.\" With those two simple phrases, he uses his strength to swing me to the side, where a window-washer platform is hanging. He lets go at the right moment and I'm launched over to the long, but thin metal basket. My landing is pathetic and I discover that I have been shot in my arm. It hurts with a stinging pain, but thank goodness it's a through-and-through. I look back up to find the masked man waving at me before he disappears. I hear a door bursting open, possibly on the roof where he was moments before, followed by sounds of men shouting, \"Where did he go?\" and \"He must be around here somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to stay quiet as the footsteps run elsewhere beyond the vicinity of the basket. When the area is calm, I look around for a way to get down. Trying to scale the two meters of brick wall that the basket hangs in front of is no option, neither is trying to climb up the steel wire that suspends it, for fear that it would snap under my additional weight. I look around me and below me. To my immediate right, as I look out across the street to another building, there is a neon sign that would've have illuminated the basket and this side of the building if if was functioning. Judging by the hum, the only side that is lit up is the other side. The tubing which the neon flows through, looks stable to use as handhold and footholds, but as my eyes adjust to the darkness, I see more sturdier places where my feet and hands can be placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA meter separates the end of the basket from the unlit side of the sign.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite it being bounced around in the rumor mill, a beta emerged to topple all betas that came before it, the game that only a significant pool of players from around the world had access to was none other than Tomb Raider Global. The makers of the game wanted to push the boundaries of what Lara Croft could do and they allowed her world to be as immersive as can be. Though she cannot be in the world with us, us players fill in her shoes to do what she does best: raiding tombs that potentially have a bunch of treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game works kinda like Mirror's Edge, where the perspective is no longer from a third-person view, but a first-person view. But parkour is not the entirety of what we players will utilize. Of course, there will be a large assortment of tools and gadgets, from the smallest, practical items, to the large vehicles we can commandeer. Gameplay could work in two ways: alone or with a group, the former being the more difficult and challenging and the latter giving the benefit of a helping hand, though if one is lucky, tomb raiders can betray other tomb raiders to increase their bounty. While some may partake in the mysteriousness of each location, inspired to learn about the lore and culture of what once was, others can be solely motivated by how much coin will be made in exchange for these intrinsic treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days ago, I received an email from someone claiming to be one of the makers of the game. Though I doubted at first, upon clicking the link, I was shown a video that was in a nutshell, an invitation personalized to me, claiming that I was one out of thousands of random entries that was selected to be invited into the game. I was also one of thirty people, one of two in America, to get invited to test out the beta, which they also claimed was more than a beta. We were able to test out every gameplay mechanic, from the open world to every interface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised me too was that I was initially paired with another player who lived on the other side of the country. To keep things anonymous and to prevent any strategic alliances to form before the launch of the beta, all players are blind on who they would be playing. They will see everyone in the game, but then again, the avatars probably won't even match the person playing them. Of course, in my case, my avatar will be female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo today is the day. Being it the start of summer, I opened my whole schedule just to get my hands on the digital download code and download the game onto my console. To my surprise, the game had nothing to download and it turned out the code was verification needed for a portal to be open. I entered the code and the portal to my console opened. The next thing I see is a blinding light which seems to envelop my whole body and the room around me. The next moment, the light fades and then darkness fills it. What in the world was that? Is this a new type of way to immerse players in, using the lights in their room to act as surrounding stimuli?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few moments, I find myself in a position I didn't think I'd be in. Instead of sitting down in front of a television screen, I'm...what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elite Dangerous is the third installment in the Elite universe and had an assortment of promising features at its launch. Of course, some of those features were non-existent in the closed and open beta version of the game, but through players playing the game, they made seamless travel between star systems, immersive ship-to-ship combat, and the ability to land and even walk on planets possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most significant part of the launch was that it the game was to be ported to next-gen consoles. This expanded the amount of players that were to be in the game, but it also took a toll on the servers. I know I had trouble accessing the game in the first week, but after my work was finished and the developers fixed the problem, I was readying to log in again. This time I would start fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first time playing the game was just through the tutorials. I found that I had some degree of vision and I could turn my head to see the cockpit around me as well as the body I was in. Since I'm a man who likes to play in female avatars, I was disappointed to find myself in a male avatar. This is why I wanted to start fresh, since I discovered in the options menu that I could change the gender of my avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo without further ado, I again logged into the game and for the first time, decided to play in an open game, where I can possibly interact with other players. I selected the mode and immediately, my screen showed a spinning ship as my loading screen. I looked around my room and found that I could see nothing but the screen in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, I find myself in the aftermath of a brutal space fight against a much larger ship. The bombardment on my ship had caused the hull to rip apart and the thick glass of my cockpit cracked and shatter, letting air escape into the vacuum of space. Life support system kick in, locking me to the chair I'm sitting in. Sensing a loss of pressure around me, the suit I'm wearing seals itself. I can do nothing but watch as a large ship passes by the ruptured cockpit and seconds later, speed off into deep space. A few seconds later, due to my panic and hyperventilation, I black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up suddenly to discover I'm in a much different place. Where am I?</span></div></div>",

I'd get whopping killstreaks and have a fantastic K-D ratio, but all I'm doing is killing other players' avatars. It may look real, but it's just not hurting anybody. When I'm logged in one day, I find that everything just seems so real. My first-person perspective seems more immersive and when I touch things with my hands, everything is genuine. Metal is solid. Flesh is squishy. Blood stains and drips more different than water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. This is not what I feel when I play the game. I usually have my hands on a controller, with my fingers pressing triggers and buttons and my thumbs controlling joysticks. I shouldn't be holding a gun's handle, touching my own skin and playing with blood that dripping from my comrade's open wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hits me, because it hits everyone. We try to leave, but can't, due to a timer or whatever reason we can't log out. Are we stuck in the game? Stuck in a place that feels as real as reality? How long do we have to stay in here? How long until the game is no longer a game?</td>",
