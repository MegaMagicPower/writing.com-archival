            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pandaria, a land shrouded by mystery and mist, or at least formerly shrouded, as the recent events of The Cataclysm had shaken the land free from its cover deep in the South Seas, and unfortunately for its native people, led to the continent becoming the newest staging ground for the ever escalating conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, with Warchief Garrosh Hellscream's forces seeking to plunder the land of its vast resources and riches for his ever growing war machine, while King Varian Wrynn and his fellow allies attempt to thwart the orc and hopefully establish a new set of ties with the Pandaren people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith threats of war and conflict surrounding multiple sides though, there were still those who were lucky enough to avoid such harsh realities. Or, in some cases, \u201clucky\u201d, as for Corporal Alexa Birdsong, she would much rather be in the thick of battle right now than in, what she would consider, the lowly reconnaissance and research mission she was handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExamine the Valley of the Four Winds, verify if whether or not it's true that they have some 'miracle' rapid food growth process, and find out if it's at all applicable to the Alliance and her people\u201d, a young blonde haired woman huffed as she trudged closer to Halfhill, the supposed center of commerce in this admittedly beautiful and exotic valley. Standing at medium height, a lithe young rogue, barely into her 20s, Alexa was one of the SI:7's fresher faces, but with numbers thinning across the board due to continuous war and strife, she was being flung head first into the latest battle between factions for the fate of Azeroth. One of those minor instances of strife happened just recently, as a set of skirmishes with the native wildlife in the Jade Forest had led to the rest of her squadron becoming MIA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProceed with the mission at all costs\u201d, she grimaced as she rubbed a sore bruise through her specialized leather armor. Her tender ache was delivered to her personally from a wild Hozen and its tribe of mischief-makers. \u201cI swear, those miserable little freaks... I'll pay back every single one of them once the team is back together!\u201d Her face turned beet red as she tightly clenched her fist. The dagger at her side ready and waiting to get some action. Right now though she needed to get her bearings, and if nothing else could be done about her team, she still had to at least report something on this goose hunt. Maybe afterward she could get reassigned to some real action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perturbed agent honestly found it a bit ironic. She grew up on a farm in Elwynn and joined the Stormwind military as a way to escape the rural life. She spent her youth running around getting into roguery and doing everything she could to not cement herself as just some dirt plowing bumpkin, and happily, she found her toned acrobatic figure a perfect match for the Alliance's spy organization, but here she was, asked to survey farmland and chum it up with the local yokels. The Pandaren she'd met so far on her journey seemed nice enough, if a little... corpulent. But who was she to judge?  She always tried to be open minded on most things, and here was a whole new race and culture right before her. They were certainly more welcoming than those damned monkeys, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could continue her pondering though, her nose caught a whiff of something absolutely enticing. A mix of smells and otherworldly aromas she could hardly place. A far flung from the boar stew back home, and the rations she currently didn't have due to an unfortunate Hozen hold up. Just over the horizon she could see her target. The center of all the farmers, cooks, and brewers of the land, as well as hopefully home to an inn where she could rest her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, her stomach rumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as hopefully home to a good meal. That she could probably bet good money on.</span></div></div>",

A slightly smaller tome hug clasped between her slender fingers, and a stack of other odd books lay strewn about her desk. Clearly, she had been doing quite a bit of reading. The Draenei sighed to herself, lowered her book, and gently rubbed her eyes. \u201cOhhh, I\u2019ll never finish at this rate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive years of study at the Violet Citadel brought Vetaala to her crowning achievement. Or so it would have, if she managed to ever finish it. The past year showed little progress on her thesis for professorship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConjuration is the school of creating objects out of pure arcane energy. For as long as there have been mages, they have practiced the art of conjuring food and drink to sustain them in their spellcasting. However, the consumables created in the traditional manner have little to no flavor, often tasting bland and unappetizing. It was a means to an end and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing it as an opportunity to mark her place in the annals of magister history, Vetaala selected the conjured as her school of focus. The mage knew if she could succeed in making an easy, flavorful conjured meal, she would be awarded her professorship without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVetaala groaned, reaching a hand down to her lower back, rubbing it tenderly. The dimly lit study did little to encourage further reading. \u201cGah! I need a break!\u201d Scooting back in her chair, the mage rises to her hooves. Her luminescent blue eyes glimpsed her profile in the adjacent standing mirror. \u201cI look like a mess!\u201d Vetaala\u2019s hair was a tousled bouquet of black curls. Her eyes lowered to her figure, and she grinned with delight. \u201cStill got the rest of it though.~\u201d She flexes childishly, admiring her svelte physique. Years of study had not hindered her daily exercises, and the young Draenei kept her tummy toned and her legs strong. Her rump was pert and taught, displaying her rigorous routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment to magically align her hair into a more stylish bedhead look, the arcanist let out a meek yawn. \u201cMmm, I wonder if Merribelle is awake yet\u2026\u201d Eager to find her human friend, the Draenei trotted toward the door to her study, swinging it open. On the other side, she was met with an unexpected surprise!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her long, wavy seafoam hair and implausibly revealing robes billowed in the wind as she caught sight of the great brute Garrosh Hellscream himself, towering on a throne of skulls and fire and spikes, Anduin Wrynn and Wrathion tied up by his side and screaming for her aid. Chuckling, she avoided his thrown axes and barrels and turned her full arcane arsenal on him, transforming the great orc warchief into a harmless sheep. The two handsome men gazed at her, clearly awestruck at her beauty. Anduin's eyes sparkled, his dewy lips parting with wonderment. \"Belyssa!\" Even Wrathion's scheming face melted into amazement and admiration, and maybe more. \"Belyssa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BELYSSA FULLMOON.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of a staff rapping lightly against her skull knocked the night elf from her blissful reverie. Around her, her fellow apprentices were giggling and tittering as the hard face of her highborne master, Harroth Silverdew glowered down at her. \"Meditating, are we? Perhaps now that your mind has been cleared, you can follow my instructions and perform a simple spell.\" The withered old night elf gazed at the rest of the class, who had produced an assortment of conjured treats. \"I assume you remember how to conjure refreshments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelyssa rubbed the soreness from her head, and brought her hands together, concentrating and channeling magic energies. She hadn't grown up with such forces... No Darnassian had, in such a long time. But the waifish elf had always wanted nothing more, even before the return of the Highborne, when there was no greater taboo amongst the kaldorei. It wasn't until the Cataclysm that she'd finally had a chance to seek out an apprenticeship... But things weren't going so well, as evidenced by the food she'd just conjured. If you could call the stale bread and clouded water she created food. Harroth just looked at the unappetizing assortment with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost makes me wish I'd stayed in Feralas. Belyssa, I want you to see me after class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelyssa's face fell, and the rest of the lesson seemed to drag on for eternity. Finally, the other students filed out, leaving her alone with Master Silverdew. The old elf shook his head as he circled her. \"I don't know what to do with you, Ms. Fullmoon. You certainly exhibit potential, and yet the only results you can produce are unimpressive failures. At best. I still have nightmares about that incident with the portals. Therefore, I feel it best that I terminate your apprenticeship here and now, before you can get into any REAL trouble. Arcane burns the uninitiated, but it does even worse to those who really know how to get in trouble with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night elf maiden panicked, kneeling down and grabbing at Harroth's robes. \"No! Nononononono! I can do better, I know I can! I just need a chance!\" The exasperated teacher looked down at her, sighing. \"You've exhausted the patience of every tutor in Darnassus. But if you are truly, TRULY desperate... I may know someone who will take you in.\" He handed her a sealed scroll and wove his staff through the air, conjuring a shimmering portal. \"Only pass through here if you are truly pre... Belyssa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked for his ex-apprentice, but it seemed she'd already gone through. \"Well then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the rest of the world came into view, Belyssa was surprised to find herself...</span></div></div>",

At least she seemed to know what she was doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sho how do we stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2:\"We wait for the moment to strike!

All her pieces were still there, including her head, which she almost regretted, because it was pounding painfully.  Her arms and legs were still there.  She patted her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer swords were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit</i>.   She opened her eyes a crack and looked around.  She was in a darkened room, with flecks of sunlight lancing in through the woven-branch walls.   Her left leg felt heavy; after a moment she discovered that that was because it was attached to the floor with a heavy chain.  There was no visible lock to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Double dammit.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to piece last night's events together.  She remembered hitting the tavern in Booty Bay with her friends.  She'd gotten drunk--scratch that, she'd gotten <i>smashed</i>.  After guzzling down enough fruit wine to float a small ship, she'd climbed on her mechano-hog and roared off towards...home?  If she hadn't been so drunk, she would have just waited for a portal.  As it was, she dimly remembered getting turned around somewhere in the northern hills, finding herself in urgent need of a bathroom, and getting off the hog to relieve herself.  Then... well, obviously something had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open and a troll stepped through.  She couldn't place the tribe; the markings weren't Bloodscalp or Skullsplitter.  A minor tribe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit.  How far off course did I go? </i> she wondered, as the troll sized her up in turn.  He was muscular, with heavy teeth, but he held his spear clumsily; Bridgit thought she could take him.  If she had her swords, anyway, and if she wasn't chained up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloh,\" the troll rasped in heavily accented Common.  \"Welcome to Stonetusk village, girl human.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgit's hopes sank further.   If they'd never seen her people before, she had to be <i>really</i> far from the beaten path.  She was probably lucky her captor spoke common at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen.   If you let me go, I can get you gold.  Jewels.\"  She coughed.  \"Shiny rocks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll grinned.  \"It would be a waste.   It is hard to find good meat here.  And you are the fattest human we have ever caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a dwarf!\" Bridgit said indignantly.   Then the full meaning of his sentence registered.  \"And I taste terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look that way,\" the troll said, sizing her up.  \"You are round and juicy.  Too bad you are so short.  Not everyone will get a piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgit gulped.  \"L-listen.  I'm really very skinny by dwarven standards.  Look, my stomach is flat--well, almost--and my breasts are only single-Ds.\"   She gestured to her leather-wrapped torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of good meat back here,\" the troll said, picking her up and giving her a slap on the butt.  The hut rang with a meaty smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, g-granted,\" Bridgit said, \"but still, I'm mostly very lean and stringy.  I don't eat much, you see, I've got to keep trim for--for my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll pondered.  \"If we fed dwarf instead of eating her now, she would get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Bridgit agreed.  \"Much, much bigger!  Get a little food in me and I just blow up like nobody's business.  Why, you'd be a fool to eat me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I can just stall for a day or so</i>, she thought desperately, <i>my friends will have time to find me.  Please, please buy it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trolls prodded her in the stomach.  \"Fat dwarf girl really will get fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huge!\" she agreed, nodding fervently.  \"You'll have leftovers for weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the troll said.  \"All right.   Instead of us having feast, you will have feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned down and snapped the chain with his bare hands.  Bridgit gulped.  If they were all this strong, it wouldn't be easy to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll turned and looked at her sternly, before adding,  \"But dwarf girl better fatten up quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's a promise,\" Bridgit said, raising her hand.   A bead of sweat trickled down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The surrounding huts and shacks were all crude and weathered, but it was the other trolls that set her nerves on edge. They looked starving! It would take some real swaying to keep her head on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, mon,\u201d the troll tugged her chain and led her to the steps of the temple. It looked like it must have been built ages ago. The stone blocks were built into the mountain behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sure hope they take the bait\u2026 the young dwarf lass swallowed the lump in her throat and hobbled toward the oldest troll she had ever seen. The withered husk of a shaman peers at her through a pair of cloudy eyes. He gestures to the escort, who then shoves Bridgit toward the elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, all right. No need to get pushy,\u201d she scowls back at the escort before remembering her potential imminent demise. Right. As the elder staggers toward her, leaning heavy on his cane, he reaches a wrinkled, shaky hand toward her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWot chu bring me, mon?\u201d the elder croaked, laying his three leathery fingers across the dwarf\u2019s impish face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt be our captive,\u201d the escort began, gripping Bridgit\u2019s chain tightly. \u201cYou tink she be good for eatin\u2019, elder?\u201d The elder slid his hand down the dwarf\u2019s neck and grasped a handful of one breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheeky bastard\u2026 she hissed. Realizing he was sizing her up for slaughter, the cunning dwarf immediately sucked in her stomach as much as she could as his hands slid beneath her bosom. Holding her breath, she saw a deep frown settle onto the elder\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWot is dis, mon? She ain\u2019t even got any meat on her bones!\u201d the elder coughed and waved the escort off dismissively. \u201cYa might as well feed her to da raptors!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgit\u2019s eyes widened in a panic, and she pulled at her chains. \u201cWait! Feed me!\u201d she cried out. The elder paused and looked her up and down through that glassy stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t got enough food for ourselves. Why we be feedin\u2019 you, little one?\u201d the shaman leaned on his cane, looming in close to the dwarf\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue pats her relatively flat stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll get fatter than the biggest boar you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on!\u201d she nods emphatically. The elder taps his chin in thought and nods his head to the side in consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do got da berries and fruit. Ya eat those things, mon?\u201d the elder\u2019s eyes peered at Bridgit, and she forced a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet! I\u2019ll eat just about anything. Give me food and you\u2019ll have to roll me around the village in no time,\u201d she laughed lightly, struggling to make it sound legit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkie dokie,\u201d the elder nodded and flicked his wrist, waving the Dwarf and her escort away. \u201cYa got a week ta put on twenty pounds,\u201d the shaman added after she began to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soddin\u2019 week?! Bridgit\u2019s eyes widened with fear. \u201cY-You can count on me\u2026\u201d Even if she managed to put on that ridiculous amount of weight, she\u2019d be severely handicapped in escaping the village. Dwarves carried their weight well, but every pound of fat was worth one-and-a-half of every human pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder, pleased to hear that, nodded sagely. \u201cIf ya hit that mark we\u2019ll keep ya around to see how big ya get, mon,\u201d the shaman gave her a devious grin, but Bridgit couldn\u2019t argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, consider it done,\u201d she spoke flatly, defeat swallowing her whole. Eating would be her only salvation until she could escape. I\u2019m gonna be bigger than a damn zeppelin...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Already?\"  It had only been an hour since her last feeding, after all, and she could swear the bowls got bigger every time.  She was so stuffed with fruit she felt like a pastry--a particularly fluffy pastry, at that, given how fat she was getting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The meanest-looking of the guards prodded Bridgit in the chest with his spear.  \"Fill ya mouth with fruit, not words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Bridgit struggled to a sitting position and dragged the bowl closer.  She was going to have to force it down if she didn't want to be skewered right here. With one hand she shoveled a handful of berries into her mouth, while she hitched up her trousers with the other in a vain attempt to keep her backside from spilling over the rear of her waistband.  She was just <i>oozing</i> out of her clothes lately--she couldn't even <i>move</i> without overflowing everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>This has</i> got <i>to be at</i> least<i> twenty pounds</i>, she judged, watching a stray berry fall and bounce off her paunch.  She told herself that was something to be happy about, but ye gods, to watch her hard-won roguish figure being buried under drifts of fat...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Somehow, she managed to finish off the every last piece of fruit, leaving the bowl empty save for a few stems and pits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"There!  And you'd better give me--<i>urpp</i>--more of a break this time!\" she groused, flopping down on her side and trying to find a comfortable position.  Her stomach was so distended she might actually burst if they tried to force more into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No more until tonight,\" the guard agreed.  Bridgit heaved a sigh of relief.  Finally, a chance for her poor overloaded digestive system to catch up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Tonight, we weight joo in,\" the guard continued.  \"See if it's worth it to keep stuffin' ya.  Don' wan ya bloated for that, do we?  We wanna know how much meat ja added, afta all, not how much ja belly holds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Bridgit felt cold.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun crept along the sky, casting longer and longer shadows through the slits in the tent. Having settled into her cushioned, sedentary lifestyle here, Bridgit almost felt contentment in her situation. That is, aside from the nagging notion that her week of feasting and sleeping drew near its end. Ironically, the plump dwarf wished she had more food or drink to fill her belly before the weigh-in. Cannibalism at the hands of trolls was NOT how she planned to go out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle churned through Bridgit, forcing a hand to her round stomach. By the Light, she felt enormous. Her fingers traced along the newly-formed crease across her side. Rolls. She had rolls. She couldn\u2019t return to the Explorer\u2019s League looking like this. And yet\u2026 she hoped she\u2019d lived up to her boasting. The dwarf rolled onto her side and stroked the dome of her gut. Even after hours of digesting, those sweet fruits still left her bloated beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footsteps approached, and a raptor\u2019s screech roused Bridgit from her gluttonous stupor. Sitting up proved an effort, but with a grunt she made it upright. Her breasts heaved over her leather cups, all that remained after pounds of flesh tore it asunder. They damn well almost reached her softened chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOy, mon. She in \u2018dere?\u201d said a troll outside the tent. An affirmative grunt preceded the parting flap. A new troll she\u2019d not met before entered and crouched in front of her. \u201cDis girlie lookin\u2019 mighty fat!\u201d he belted out a gravelly laugh and prodded her belly with one finger. She flushed as the flesh sunk in like bread dough. \u201cI tink de eldar will be pleased.\u201d Bridgit could have sworn he gave her a wink after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d she asked, face still red. She clutched her belly and wobbled it for good measure. Her face burned with humiliation. She could feel the flab smothering her thick arms jiggle as she shook herself for the trolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silent troll in the back licked his lips, eyeing her like a roast. The crouched troll nodded. \u201cYa, girlie. Ya be lookin\u2019 mighty tasty now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Bridgit,\u201d she spat, sticking a wet glob to his cheek. He smeared it off, but smudged some of his warpaint in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll righ\u2019, Bridgit. Let\u2019s see wot de eldar tinks of ya,\u201d he growled and seized her by one, fleshy arm. He hoisted her to her feet, and she swayed, unaccustomed to her added weight. How in the world was she supposed to sneak anywhere like this? He bound her wrists and fastened a leash to the saddle of his raptor. Bridgit squeaked with surprise when he hefted her onto the raptor\u2019s back. This brought a small smile to her face, as they left her barefoot to prevent escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019 want ya to waste any energy now, girlie,\u201d he laughed again. The raptor lurched forward before settling into a trot as her smudged captor strolled beside it. Each bump sent Bridgit\u2019s bosom quivering in her tattered top. Her trembling belly flesh peeked through numerous torn seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile passing through the village, she noticed the general slenderness of its inhabitants. They all looked hungry. Bridgit shuddered at the notion of being sized up for feasting. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t take long to reach the elder\u2019s hut. Soon her fears would be delayed or made a reality. The dwarf breathed slowly, but her heart raced in her chest. Her smudged chaperone sunk his fingers into her soft love handles before dismounting the dwarf from the saddle. She cringed as her toes sunk into the cold, muddy earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bridgit stood the elder\u2019s lodge, a tall, narrow tent. Blue smoke belched from the peak at the top of the fabric canopy, and wisps of fog curled out from the parted flaps. The raptor troll nudged the plump dwarf forward toward the lodge. Swallowing hard, she waddled into the foggy darkness. At first, she saw only a campfire at the center, but it burned with dreamy, blue flame. A thick, blue smoke filled the room with the smell of spiced, incense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA week, as agreed,\u201d she heard the elder croak. He appeared from within the fog and stooped low, admiring the dwarf. She stumbled back and bumped into a wooden table. How did she miss that? The elder stretched forth a gnarled hand and began inspecting her body, this time beginning with the small beginnings of a double chin. He slid his hand down her neck and cupped a breast, raising his eyebrows. \u201cOhhh, ya feel fuller already\u2026 but are ya worthy?\u201d he furrowed his brow and began sliding his hand lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a reversal of last week, she muffled a grunt and stuck out her belly as far as she could, trying to appear heavier. The old shaman paused as he reached her stomach, his mouth falling agape. Slowly, with the utmost scrutiny, his fingers coursed over her plush dome of flesh, cheekily slipping one claw into her deep navel before continuing down. Bridgit quietly exhaled, and the elder gripped the doughy, dimpled meat of Bridgit\u2019s backside in one hand. His chuckles and blind nods eased some of Bridgit\u2019s tension. He leaned on his staff and let out a sharp whistle. The flaps parted and the smudged countenance of her captor appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDa spirits have spoken, brotha,\u201d the elder spoke, gesturing toward the flabby rogue, \u201cShe be da one! After I give her da mojo, you take her to da shrine,\u201d he explained. Wait, mojo? Shrine? Bridgit frowned, but her confusion only gave the elder an opportunity to grab a gourd flask from the table behind her. He popped the cork and plunged the bottle between her full lips. Bridgit floundered, but she was already seated and couldn\u2019t gain the momentum to stand. The viscous, sour elixir hit her tongue and bubbled before sliding down her throat. Stars popped in Bridgit\u2019s vision and her view swayed and spun before melting into darkness...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Interactive Chapter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgit yawned and rubbed her eyes. It immediately came to her attention that she was still mostly naked, save for the strained remnants of her tunic and her split pants. Sitting upright, she gazed across her plump form and saw strange, tribal patterns painted along her limbs and across her belly. She tried to wipe it off, but it didn\u2019t smudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking beyond herself, Bridget realized she sat atop a raised, cushioned platform in the middle of a troll temple. The angular, stone snake columns were a dead giveaway. As an expert dungeoneer, Bridgit dated the temple in the thousands of years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn each cardinal direction she saw a troll robed in colorful, dyed garb. Each bore similar markings to her own. Each knelt in prayer, uttering some incantation in troll tongue. No chains held her in place, but even she recognized her increased girth and the difficulty of standing that accompanies it. Bridgit grabbed a handful of her doughy belly and scoffed. She regained alertness when the elder entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSezilak, da hungerer! We offa dis dwarf in exchange for a bountiful huntin\u2019 season!\u201d the elder cried out and sliced his hand on a dagger. When he reached out, Bridgit attempted to squirm away, but two burly guards seized her arms and legs. Again a gnarled hand reached toward the dwarf, this time dripping crimson. It smeared a crude symbol around her navel and another across her mouth and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! You don\u2019t have to do this, just let me go!\u201d Bridgit pleaded, to no avail. Her words went unheeded as the ritual continued. The elder joined the chanting, and the torches around the chamber dimmed before erupting into blue flame. The smoke billowed and swirled around the chamber, coalescing into the shape of a long serpent sporting a gaping mouth. Bridgit glanced about the chamber and noticed the smudged warrior. \u201cHelp me! Please help--\u201d but her words cut off as the smoke serpent dove down her throat. Winding and coursing, it filled her belly, growing it inch by inch. The guards released her as the dwarf found herself pinned beneath her engorged gut. The smoke filled her body with an intense warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA luxurious fog filled Bridgit\u2019s mind. Her glazed eyes glanced down and beheld her form. She saw her body filled out, bloated like a bountiful wineskin. Deep churning reminded the dwarf of the smoky spirit that filled her stomach. Despite her groggy state, she guessed her belly jutted out another half-foot at least. Sneaking seemed less and less like a viable escape plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou survived da ordeal and accepted da spirit. Dere\u2019s a loa dwellin\u2019 in ya belly, dwarf,\u201d the elder croaked and once more leaned on his staff. Two of the colorful priests approached and mended his wounded hand. \u201cSezilak be a fickle loa. He always be hungry, but he rewards us wit\u2019 plenty to eat ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what did you do to me?\u201d Bridgit groaned and clapped a hand to her swollen stomach. She easily looked nine months with child, and another surge from within made her shiver with unease at that comparison. The elder pointed the head of his staff at the ring of paint around the fattened dwarf\u2019s navel. The paint now glowed. A priest held up a mirror and Bridgit saw the ring around her mouth and chin glowed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bear da loa of gluttony, girlie,\u201d the elder chuckled before turning about to leave. The north, south, east, and west priestesses approached bearing wooden platters of various fruits and meats. Meat! She hadn\u2019t had a good hock of meat in over a week. She could taste the beer-basted boar\u2019s ribs back in Kharanos already. This looked to be local boar, but it would be a welcome change from the fruit stuffing she\u2019d been gobbling up for days on end. Regardless, Bridgit glanced around for an exit. She noticed a long hallway beyond the platter-bearing priests and pondered her options. The tantalizing scent of roast pork, fresh bread, and baked beans whetted Bridgit\u2019s appetite anew as her stomach rumbled in anticipation. She had to think fast before her painted belly made the decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The most illustrious airship in the entirety of the Alliance fleet, The Skyfire had already quite the history before falling into the hands of Admiral Rogers. Present at the downfall of Deathwing himself and nearly a Horde conflicts before it, The Skyfire had become a beacon for Alliance soldiers in even the dire of battles, and Admiral Rogers certainly felt that she was in such a position. Surrounded on all ends by a deep impenetrable mist, Rogers and the men and women of the Skyfire had been hopelessly lost for nearly a week now. Handpicked by King Wrynn himself, the crew of the Skyfire were on a mission of the utmost importance, tasked with the retrieval of \"The White Pawn\". In actuality, Prince Anduin Wrynn who had become shipwrecked in an earlier expedition to a newly emerged continent in the South Seas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Admiral Rogers!\" shouted a runty gnome from the far deck, diminutive even by the standards of his own people. \"You have to come see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"First mate, report!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Admiral...\" the gnome pointed out in front of him. A translucent glow had begun to appear in the mist and as The Skyfire chugged closer, it became readily more apparent what it was, a raging fire in the far distance. The gnome pulled out a spyglass as he peered into the distance, twisting the focus as the image before became more readily apparent. It was a shipwrecked Horde scout, stranded amongst a cluster of jagged rocks illuminated in the mists only by the burning inferno that raged even against the crashing tides. \"None of the intell suggested that the Horde would be present!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Admiral Rogers was taken aback. \"Details were scant, but I can't pretend I'm surpris-\" The Admiral stopped mid-sentence, as the mist immediately began to clear almost as if it had never been present at all. The Admiral gazed upon the landscape as it so suddenly came into focus. It was unlike anything she had ever seen, a serene forest of sparkling emerald that seemed to stretch on for as far as the eye could see. To go from nearly a week of nothing, but a listless fog to such majesty in a moment's notice was enough to distract the Admiral from what lay right before her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sound of coarse shouting voices broke her from her trance. It turned out that the Horde encampment below them was just as surprised by the sudden emergence of the Airship as they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"First mate; battle stations!!\" the Admiral bellowed, as the crew of the Skyfire scurried to the gun turrets, attempting to mow down any Horde that made it to the goblin flak cannons below. The battle raged for what seemed to be only a moment, the Skyfire reigned havoc upon the unprepared denizens of the make-shift forward camps, but it ended as quickly as it started as a goblin engineer managed to set off a dragon rocket at the big broad target. The goblin missile hit with the force of a cataclysm, the entire airship careened violently in response as it struggled to keep altitude. The Admiral rushed to the engine room, barely managing to keep her balance as the Skyfire lurched violently, throwing any crewman to close to the railing overboard. The Admiral arrived just in time to see her engineers hard at work, trying to keep the engine running by any means necessary. \"We need to cool it down, it's going critical\" one of the engineers shouted, as the engine roared, steam erupting from nearly every safety gauge attached. \"It's going to blow!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Admiral deftly dived to her feet, barely managing to stay aboard as the backdraft from the explosion blew the stern of the ship clear off. Rogers watched in horror as crew mates plummeted to a watery death, swept clean off their feet by the force of the explosion. Rogers took a tight grip of the railing, as pulled herself up to take one last look at the carnage below her. She managed to spot the one thing that gave her hope in her final moments the sign of a rampaging Worgen tearing an entire grunt platoon apart limb from limb in a brutal blood frenzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ha, that almost makes it worth it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A lone figure on an empty beach, Alissa Ravenwing stirred from unconsciousness as she grasped one arm out weakly, clawing at the sand as she pulled herself up. The tides crashing down on her and soaked from inch to inch, Alissa fought to keep consciousness as she struggled to remember the events that had transpired. A champion of the Cataclysm Campaigns, and a former Warden of the Cenarion Circle, Alissa had been requested to accompany SI:7 during a personal audience with the High King himself. She had thought herself dead when The Skyfire crashed into this newfound land, but obviously it seemed that fate still had plans from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa surveyed the beach, finding little, but assorted driftwood and flotsam from the crashed gunship. Her belongings had vanished from as far as she could tell, and the majority of her equipment with it. \"Hmph...\" Alissa grunted as she walked down the beach barefoot, her toes sinking into the wet sand. \"Couldn't have even spared my boots?\" she whined to no one in particular. It was of no particular matter to her though, a staff and a pair of boots were of no real use when you could transform into a hulking bear at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way into the forest, Alissa was at awe of the serene beauty that made up this strange new land. Untainted by it's inhabitants, Jade Forest was a stark reminder of the beauty that had once stretched throughout all of Northern Kalimdor. Before the Horde began it's mass logging campaign in Ashenvale, tearing down large chunks of Lissa's century year old home. Before the Burning Legion tainted what was now known to be Felwood. Before the Cataclysm which had torn Darkshore asunder. For all of it's majesty, this strange emerald forest had managed only to open old wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the guise of a panther, Alissa skulked through the forest hoping to come across any survivors of the Skyfire. Alissa wandered for hours before a familiar sound caught her attention. The sound of goblin buzzsaws whirling and axes plunging into the trees. Alissa's blood boiled at the very idea of it, with every swing of the axe, painful memories of Lissa's beloved homeland bubbled to the surface. Every felled tree, every inch of the forest that had been set ablaze, the very death of Cenarius. It all triggered in that moment. Without a moment's hesitation, Alissa sprinted towards the cacophony with a lust for blood in her heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zug Zug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taskmaster looked down at the Peon that had been so bold as to address her, a look of contempt in her eyes. \"What is it worm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...me no be meaning to be interrupting big important bosslady, but...\" The Peon reached into his pack, before removing an object that had been wrapped tightly in a poorly-stitched blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better be worth my time...\" she said, spitting on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peon removed the blanket, revealing an object that positively beamed in the sunlight. It was a scroll, but nothing like she had ever seen before. Stitched in what almost seemed to be pure gold, and held together by onyx handles, the scroll was written in a language like she had never seen. Each word was gilded with ruby, making the words seem almost as if they had been handed down by the gods themselves. \"We found it while cutting wood, thought bosslady might think it important. Maybe peons get extra food ration today??\" he asked earnestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taskmaster's stood stone face as she glared down at the peon. \"Get back to work, dog.\" The peon scurried off terrified with nary another word. \"Surrounded on all sides by idiots\" she muttered, as she wrapped the scroll up and handed it off to one of the goblins in the surrounding area. \"Hold onto this, until we can get a local to translate it. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peon worker wandered back to his station meekly, heartbroken that he'd have to be the one to break the news to his comrades that their would be no extra rations tonight for a job well done. He was positive that \"bosslady\" would not only be happy to see that they had uncovered a priceless artifact, but would reward their initiative with a hearty extra helping of orcish gruel. He pondered long about all the ways he had went wrong in his approach, before his thoughts were broken. The sound of rustling leaves and twigs snapping in the distance caught his attention as he went to investigate, uncertain what could be causing such a ruckus. \"Huh...\" he said aloud. \"Anybody out the-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa immediately leaped out from the clearing, pouncing upon the hapless peon, tearing his throat with her claws. Alissa quickly surveyed the logging camp, it was small. Freshly set up. It wouldn't take long before she brought the entire thing operation crashing down on in flames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy prey...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In days passed, the brilliant pink leaves of the glade\u2019s trees would rustle lightly in breezes blown in from the sea. The natives would spend afternoons in the soft grass below the boughs of the trees watching them dance in the wind. Today, what natives remained stained the grass red and embraced it with their bellies instead of their backs. The trees jerked and shuddered, oozing sap onto the stained ground as axes were sunk into their trunks. The orcs may have well have been sinking those tools into Alissa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the edge of the grove a lithe panther exploded through what small brush separated her from the first peon she felled. The first pair of peons assailing the ancient trees were on the ground and bleeding profusely before anyone could so much as shout in confusion. Alissa pounced from the hemorrhaged peons, bloodied paws landing with little noise. Yells of alarm rippled through-out the small camp and a half-dozen or so peons hefted their chipped axes to defend themselves or abandoned kodo-hide tents before they could be fully erected.  In the back of the hastily assembled camp a pair of goblins playing cards were interrupted, the female taking advantage of her partner\u2019s distraction by sweeping the anted gold pieces into her arms and bolting to the safety of the forest, only to be followed by a furious comrade moments later with the scroll leaning against their table forgotten. What caught Alissa\u2019s eye in particular was a sturdy orc woman, turning from a collection of restrained prisoners with a look of malice etched upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa snarled, leaping sideways to evade a hastily swung peon lumber ax. The muscles in her hind legs coiled and released as she didn\u2019t so much jump on but over the orc. With a fluid motion she dug her claws into her flesh, launching herself clear of the lacerated peon and onto the one behind him. She landed with fangs bared and clasped down on his throat. She leapt again, tearing chunks of flesh as she did so. An axe intended for her back imbedded itself in the chest of the downed peon; Alissa raked her claws across the chest of the weapon\u2019s owner before slamming her hard skull into the open wound and shoving the orc off his feet. Blood splattered onto the short purple hairs of her head, further adding to the mess of red staining her snout. Her ears twitched, her head swiveling in response to a throaty war cry. The stony ork woman thundered towards Alissa slicing down with a massive sword. The druid squirmed in her attempts to rush forward. The howling blade bit flesh, drawing thin ribbons of red from a slice running down the druid\u2019s flank. Alissa pivoted on nimble paws that were swelling larger by the second. Her thin form ballooned with layers of muscle and fur as a deadly predator yielded to an unstoppable behemoth. The bear charged, a glancing sword blow shaving only hair off her thick shoulder, smashing directly into the orc\u2019s armored gut. The taskmaster grunted and stumbled, digging her heels into the ground in an attempt to stop her backwards listing. Alissa bellowed a gutteral roar, drowning out a high-pitched voice shouting in the distance. She hefted a claw and swiped it forward. The impact dented the task master\u2019s armor and forced the orc to the ground. Alissa shifted her weight and slammed the female once again with enough force to make her tumble a few feet. She heard armor crunching and the faint drag of a sword sliding through soil. The voice returned, more insistent this time. The druid lifted her claw one more time, snarling at the orc staring defiantly up at her through a haze of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa hesitated, her claw hitching in mid swipe. She gazed at the orc before her, matching a returned stare that was full of mirrored hatred, anger, and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more! Please.\u201d The soft female voice pleaded as a sob nearly made her speech inaudible. Alissa pinned the orc to the ground with a heavy paw before turning to face to the origin of the sound. A small gnome in tattered, oil-stained coveralls with pink pigtails was staring at her with wide water-rimmed blue eyes. Tears pattered softly against the ground. The druid sighed, her form slimming as she returned to her full height, her bare lavender foot pressing against the downed taskmaster. Alissa beseeched the trees of this grove, requesting they contain her prisoner as she released the others. The grove responded, gnarled roots burst from the ground and ensnared the orc in their sturdy grip. She struggled against them, grunting in effort. Alissa awkwardly padded over to the crying gnome, who had since hidden her face behind pink bangs. The gnome was separated from the remainder of the prisoners, all Pandaren and most of them cubs. Alissa winced with each step she took, pain lancing through her wounded thigh. She swallowed, unsure how to deal with an emotionally distraught civilian. She attempted to clean some of the blood from her face before clearing her throat, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat looked up at her was not the distraught civilian that she expected. The small gnome produced an intense look with furrowed brow, her eyes dry and narrow. \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d The gnome hissed in a low whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry?\u201d Alissa reeled from the small woman, her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Skyfire is grounded, maybe even destroyed. Its crew is scattered and we\u2019ve only encountered one horde settlement.\u201d She spoke as though this was an obvious fact. \u201cAnd you want to kill the first horde leader we find without even <i>trying</i> to get information out of her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s just the leash holder of a ring of lumber-chopping thugs, why wou-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIntelligence gathering has to start somewhere.\u201d The gnome interrupted, fidgeting against her bonds. \u201cEveryone wants to get to the boss right away and always forgets that you need to shake down the menials first to know where to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa moved to assist her, but the gnome stood. Strands of sliced rope fell to the ground and she slipped a small gnomish pocket knife back into the band of her belt. \u201cAt the very least, she can give us an idea if there are more of these camps and where they may be.\u201d The gnome turned her attention to Alissa, casting her gaze up and down the night elf. \u201cSo, you must be the druid the King stuck with us. Ravenwing right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Alissa gave a nod, rubbing the rest of the blood from her face. \u201cThough seeing as it\u2019s just us, Alissa is fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome shrugged non-committedly, \u201cIf we\u2019re being informal you might as well just call me Miki. Now, Alissa, please help the rest of the prisoners while I search this camp for anything worth taking with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Alissa gave the gnome a side-long glance. Miki Thermocog had been quiet on the journey over; Alissa had only run into her a few times. The druid had taken her to be part of the engineering team that kept the ponderous ship moving. Alissa shook her head, tending to the bewildered natives and properly securing the injured orc taskmaster. From what the natives told her, there was a village nearby. The horde had attempted to seek harborage there a few days ago, but flew into a rage when denied. They assaulted the village, taking children and field workers prisoner before setting up in the village\u2019s fields to chop down trees. The adult prisoners offered to lead the two there as thanks for rescuing them and extended an invitation to stay and have a drink. It was at this point Miki cut in and asked if anyone there could translate a scroll. Apparently the only thing of interest she could find was an ornate scroll with onyx handles and jeweled lettering that was obviously not written in orcish script and that these natives could not read. Upon assurances that there was a lore walker within Paw\u2019don village, Miki agreed to join the natives in returning to their home. Alissa hauled the injured and bound orc over her shoulders. Her form shifted resulting in the orc being draped across the back of a tall, sturdy deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren natives led them to a quaint village nestled in the hills of the glade. Short walls surrounded it and simple one story buildings with teal tiled roofs sat on raised hills behind the walls. A small crowd of villagers clamored at the arrival of their loved ones. Parents ran forward to scoop up their children and hold them tight. Alissa\u2019s chest swelled as she watched the natives re-unite with those the horde took from them. A male pandaren with a wide brimmed sunhat and a staff that had a bottle hanging from it approached the two alliance women with a smile on his face. Miki turned to regard him but a dull hush had descended on the crowd and suffocated the joyous mood. They followed the trail of gazes to the road, noticing a figured padding up the smooth stone path. It was a worgen, black fur stained almost entirely blood red. The loose metal plates strapped to his hulking form clanked as he hefted a limp individual cradled under his right arm. Soft orange eyes smoldered with iris flitting about to examine the crowd of pandaren, his attentive ears were nicked and scarred. He approached the gate, stopping shy of the two guards holding steady to either side. He regarded them with quick glances before looking at the other two alliance members. He spoke with a deep voice, refined voice tinged with the faint grumble characteristic of worgen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies,\u201d He gave a courteous nod of his head, \u201cwe need a medic.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a female dwarf, garbed in white vestments, her red hair twisted into twin braids that fell lifelessly against her chest. The former white brilliance of her robes had been obscured by a concerning amount of dirt and dried blood, it seems that she had been left to die for hours before she had been found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa instantly recognized her, as she pulled the woman's hair back, revealing her face. It was Ingrid Thunderstout, one of the many adventurers that had accompanied her on the Skyfire. Boisterous, kind hearted, and shockingly indulgent for one of the Light's Faith.  Alissa struggled to remember a single time that the pudgy woman, even for one of her race, wasn't proudly waving around a drumstick and a full pint of ale. Alissa was never much for companions, but it was hard to ignore Ingrid when she went to such lengths to make her presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures.\" Miki said as she ducked beneath Alissa, getting a closer look at the unconscious priest. \"When I was debriefed before the mission, I was led to believe that she's one helluva healer.  She would certainly be useful healing, uh, herself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa glanced at the gnome, fighting back the urge to roll her eyes. \"Please step aside while I attend to her.\" she said as she pushed the gnome aside. Alissa looked around, her eyes perking up as she spotted a small pile of leaves that had scattered among the ground. Snatching them up, she began to gently whisper into bundle of leaves, her voice calm and nurturing as she beckoned for nature's call. The leaves responded in turn, a small green light emanated from them, quickly becoming brighter and brighter as the leaves lost form. Alissa pressed the healing energy into Ingrid's lacerations, the open wounds slowly began closing. She moved from wound to wound, the Dwarf's color returning as she was brought further away from death. Alissa stood, addressing the rest of the group. \"She's stabilized, though I advise we get her some rest before we stir her awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Miki said, as she turned her attention to the fearsome Worgen that towered over her, the Warrior still drenched in blood. \"Aaron Gregory Culverstone I presume?\" The Worgen nodded in turn. \"Ah.\" Miki continued. \"Former Noble turned Gilnean Revolutionary. Warrior, Gentlemen, with a bit of a problem with his temper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now if that ain't the hat trick. You're three for three!\" Aaron said with a snicker, his  voice drenched in a thick Gilnean accent. \"Now I don't recall for a moment sharing more than a word with you above the Skyfire, you plan on telling me how you seem to know quite so much about me and our sleeping beauty in the corner over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SI:7.\" Miki said proudly, the crevices of her mouth turning into a slight smile just at the sound of her station. \"Let's just say, we didn't just bring a bunch of numskulls straight out of Abbeyshire on a mission of this importance. I know everything about you stretching back to your grandparents. Now if we're done measuring dicks, we have some ground to cover. We're stranded big time, in a strange new land, with the Horde breathing down our neck on every side. The Skyfire is a wreck, and as far as I can tell, we may possibly be the only survivors.\" Miki looked out into the horizon, the smoke of  the logging camp still visible in the distance. \"The Horde have already set up camp, and if we have any hope of rooting them out and finding the Prince. At least the locals are friendly. Our best lead right now is that Orc, but I get the feeling that she's not quite up to talking right now..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa interjected, as she reached for her belt and retrieved the scroll that they had confiscated. \"What about this scroll? I believe we were told that a Lorewalker in town might have some answers to it's origins?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron immediately froze at the sight of the scroll, as his eyes contracted into a fierce glare. A swirl of what seemed to be a black viscous liquid danced around the edges of the scroll for a brief moment before retreating back into the parchment.  \"You all see that? Bit of witchcraft right there if you ask me. I ain't having none of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiki raised an eyebrow. \"Are you serious? Cut the nonsense, this is our best lead at the moment. Even if it turns up to be a dead end, the locals might at least be gracious to have it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel nothing but darkness from this scroll, ruffles my fur just the sight of it.\" Aaron snarled, as he pushed past the rest of the group heading back into town. \"If you're gonna push on like a couple of half-wits playing with strange magic you ain't even got the slightest clue about, then be my guest. Come find me when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot...\" Miki rolled her eyes, as she redrew her attention to the unconscious dwarf slumped over the ground. \"Well, if you're up for heaving our friend around, shall we proceed Alissa?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alissa grunted and groaned as she heaved the hefty dwarf through the doors leading to the Lorewalker Library. \"She's...heavier than she looks.\" she moaned to Miki, the small gnome fought to stifle a giggle in return.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a simple library, the Lorewalker outpost was bursting at the seams with artifacts of bygone eras.  Each wall was adorned with elaborate scrolls, each scrawled with characters from a language they had never seen before, each adorned with gold and valuable gems. Elaborate ornate weaponry hung from the ceilings, magnificent in their construction and far more elegant than anything they had seen the local guard wield. Fearsome dog statues hung over the entrance to the library, and even more noticeable were the mountains of books. Stuffed into every single available shelf, and then some, it seemed that the Lorewalkers had even begun stacking them on the ground, huge piles of books threatening to reach the ceiling. The two adventurers had never seen anything quite like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single solitary Pandaren greeted them as they entered, her hair in buns highlighted by a single green streak. She welcomed them warmly as she lit a stick of incense, it's smoke filling the room with a relaxing aroma. \"Greetings, travelers from beyond the mist.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa gingerly placed Ingrid on a bench in the corner, as she went to greet the Lorewalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met, friend.\" Alissa said with a courteous bow. \"I am Alissa Ravenwing and my companion is Miki Thermocog. Thank you for the pleasure of this meeting.\" Miki bowed in turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine. I am Lorewalker Suchong. What assistance may I offer you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlissa retrieved the scroll from her waistband, offering it to the Lorewalker. The Lorewalker unraveled the scroll silently skimming it as a look of fret began to unfold over her gentle demeanor. Without a word, she silently wrapped the scroll back up before walking to the other side of the room. She sifted through a large pile of tomes before arriving at one, scooping it up in one arm as she returned to the confused duo.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Tell me travelers. What do you know of the Sha?\" the concern in her voice was barely palatable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what-now?\" Miki asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lorewalker turned her back to the two adventurers, her attention fixated on the plumes of smoke that arose from her incense burner. Tearing a page from the tome she retrieved, she tore the page to shreds before delicately placing them in a small divot in the burner. Grabbing the incense stick, she touched the flame to the torn page. The flame was weak at first before rapidly growing out of control. The page burned to cinders, and from the smoke arose fantastic images of enormous black and white beasts. Hulking centipede like creatures adorned with malevolent twisted faces. Miki and Alissa both took a hesitant step back, unnerved by the monstrous beings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sha...\" Suchong began as the room went oddly dark, save the stage which was brightly illuminated by the strange flame that had been lit. \"The physical manifestation of the negative emotions that plague all who walk this world. Fear, Hatred, Anger, Violence, Doubt, and Despair, they are the outward embodiment of the blackness that inhabits the deepest corner of every man, woman, and child. With every harsh word, with every thrown punch, their essence gathers, growing stronger, as they bide their time until their power erupts corrupting every being in it's wake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of her wrist, Suchong fanned the flames, the monstrous beings disappeared, quickly replaced by a single Sha.

Richer in Pandaren culture, but still mystified in terms of the next step of their journey Alissa and Miki left the temple slightly dejected. Aaron had made his way to the local inn and the three women followed suit. Alissa wasn't quite sure what their next step was, but there was one thing she knew for certain. She was famished.  </span></div></div>",

Full of natives laughing and talking, the sound of clinking glasses, and the sizzling of food in iron woks. The scent of saut\u00e9ed meats mingled with hints of smoke and alcohol. Fire crackled in the hearth and torches blazed in their sconces, casting a warm light throughout the wooden building.  Dozens of pandaren villagers rested at circular wooden tables, sitting on sturdy wooden stools and partaking in veritable feats of freshly cooked meals and cold ale. Aaron drew his gaze back, inhaling deeply. The worgen maneuvered his way to the hearth situated in the back. He walked with light step, feeling a bit cold after taking a dip in a nearby creek to clean up.  A warm fire would definitely do him good. He set down near the fire, laying a pack loaded with clean armor and weapons by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes, reveling in the warmth washing over his fur. \u2018We\u2019re done cocked here it seems,\u2019 Aaron flared his nostrils, exhaling roughly \u2018Left with nothing but a spanner in the works and the sad remnants of a gormless rescue team. Need to pull it together somehow or we\u2019re right screwed.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there you are.\u201d A haggard voice croaked, maybe a few feet from Aaron\u2019s right.  His ear flicked and he shifted his head, opening an eye. A pair of pandaren stood behind him, one wearing weathered gray clothing and leaning on a bamboo staff. The other stood tall and was dressed in dark leathers, a wide brimmed hat, and a loose belt cinched with a medallion of a tiger\u2019s face. Most noticeable was a spaulder of a roaring tiger on his right shoulder.  Most of his face was obscured by a crimson mask, but his judgmental gaze was harshly analyzing the worgen. Aaron\u2019s eyes narrowed, answering the newcomer\u2019s challenge. His fiery orange eyes locked defiantly with the fierce yellows of the Pandaren.<br>\r\n\u201cLord Zhu, this is one of the outsiders that saved our village.\u201d The mayor spoke awkwardly. Sunke Khang if Aaron remembered correctly. He spoke with Khang briefly while on the way to wash up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhang shuffled, eyes shifting between the frowning worgen and the masked pandaren. \u201cThe villagers speak of how you entered,\u201d Zhu finally spoke, even his voice pointed and harsh, \u201ccoated from head to paw in blood. You would do well to be careful about what kind of energy you bring to our lands.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about me going off my trolley and tearing your people limb from limb, don\u2019t.\u201d Aaron snorted, turning back to the fire \u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at controlling it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou call slaughtering an entire encampment of people in the most visceral fashion possible control?\u201d It was Zhu\u2019s turn to scoff.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re charitable to call the horde \u2018people\u2019. You\u2019re better off without them; trust me that lot ruins everything they touch.\u201d<br>\r\nAaron could feel Zhu\u2019s stare boring into the back of his head. \u201cWe can defend ourselves from this horde stranger and we can defend ourselves from you. We will not participate in this bloodbath you look to bring with you. We will not tolerate your genocidal war on our shores.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen it\u2019s your lucky day mate,\u201d Aaron turned to glower at Zhu once again, \u201cbecause we\u2019re here on a \u2018peaceful rescue mission\u2019.\u201d He snapped, reciting the mission statement they were given on the Skyfire before it was split in two.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a twisted notion of peace, outsider.\u201d Zhu remarked, turning away from the worgen. Aaron heard them take several steps, likely enough for Zhu to assume they would not be heard over the din of the inn. But Zhu did not count on the berserker\u2019s sharp hearing. \u201cYou can give these outsiders quarter at your discretion Khang, but do not get wrapped up in their conflict. They bring nothing but their race-war here. I must go; there are others that have landed in the north.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhite Tiger watch over you, Lord Zhu.\u201d The Mayor bowed. The sound of footsteps signaled Zhu\u2019s retreat. Khang sighed, approaching Aaron once more. \u201cYou and your friends are welcome to stay in our village, it is the least we could do. But I implore you; please take his words to heart.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your hospitality, Mayor.\u201d Aaron responded flatly, not turning from the fire. Khang gave a resigned nod, disguising a frown and turning to leave the inn. Aaron spent the next few minutes in relative silence, tuning out the ruckus of the bar and focusing on the raging fire in front of him. It was nice; he hadn\u2019t had time to relax since before they left Stormwind. Conditions aboard the Skyfire had been cramped and loud and it had proved impossible to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an unknown amount of time an insistent prodding in his shoulder stirred Aaron from his trance. There was a voice prattling off with the poking, speaking curtly. \u201cAG, hey AG. Stop staring at the fire we have work to do.\u201d The gnomish imp was pressing two fingers into his shoulder blades.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me AG.\u201d Aaron grumbled, pushing himself up. The others were assembled behind him with Alissa sitting at a table with the dwarven priest, trying to help her through the wake-up process. The orc was tied down in the corner and Miki was staring at him, arms crossed. He followed her over to the table, lowering himself onto the short stool and bowing his legs to scoot close. He shot Miki an expectant glance, folding his hands on the table. \u201cSo, find anything worth noting in that daemon scroll of yours?\u201d<br>\r\nThe gnome waved her hand dismissively, \u201cjust a history lesson about a monk that sacrificed herself to stop a Sha.\u201d She glanced at Aaron noticing his cocked eyebrow, \u201cPhysical manifestations of negative emotions of the people here. This one happened to be about a lesser Sha, the Sha of Gluttony.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI told you that was no good business.\u201d He frowned, \u201cThing\u2019s probably cursed too.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly thing we were cursed with was useless information and folk tales.\u201d Miki grumbled, looking at Ingrid as she pulled her head off the table and groaned. \u201cOnly one lead left now.\u201d She winced, her sentence punctuated by a low grumble as she put a hand on her stomach. \u201cUgh, but first we should get something to eat. I feel like I haven\u2019t eaten in days.\u201d<br>\r\nAaron nodded, turning to the druid sitting across from him. \u201cHow\u2019s our patient doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOut of it, though she seems to be-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cBoth me head an\u2019 gut are pounding.\u201d Ingrid cut off Alissa, holding her head in her hands. \u201cAuch, just gimme a pint and a bite and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <br>\r\nThe Worgen shook his head, \u201cMight as well stay the night. A good rest and a nice supper will fix both of those problems.\u201d His ears twitched, registering another rumble. He angled an eyebrow at Alissa, the night elf shrugging her shoulders sheepishly in response. Aaron rolled his eyes, \u201cguess we\u2019re getting food to go around then. Well, since we\u2019re shacking up for the night I\u2019m going to get a drink.\u201d He pushed himself from the table, padding through the tavern towards the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn\u2019t wait long before he left to flag down a waitress. Cries of \u2018that sounds good\u2019 and \u2018I would like one of those\u2019 reached his ears and he swore he heard one of them say \u2018why don\u2019t we just order everything?\u2019 before their voices were lost amongst laughter and clinking mugs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron slid onto one of the short stools near the bar; he ran his hands along sturdy wood of the counter. It was worn with ages of sliding mugs and steins across it and stained by splotches of greasy food complimented by thin rings left behind by countless beverages. The barkeep was an older native woman with a pony tail; she turned to Aaron as he sat down. The woman beamed at him, pronouncing a few wrinkles near her mouth. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron returned the smile briefly, thankful she wasn\u2019t put off by the maw full of sharp teeth, \u201cStout please, darkest you have.\u201d<br>\r\nShe gave a nod, spinning on her heels to a shelf packed with a mind numbing variety of bottles.  She deftly yanked a bottle out of the stack without disturbing the others around it and produced a glass. With little pomp she filled the glass and set it down on the counter  within a few second, sliding it towards the Worgen. Her smile grew as Aaron\u2019s eyes widened and he slowly fished out a few coins and set them down on the counter. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d She bowed her head and turned to satisfy other patrons, pulling and re-shelving bottles with an artistic grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft giggle drew his attention from the display; a female pandaren had taken the seat next to him. She wore a smile, like many of the natives here did. Her fur was auburn and white, a mask of russet colour surrounded her green eyes. She brushed a lock of green hair out of her face, a streak distinctly different from the brown of her hair, some of which pulled back into a braided pony tail and the rest cascading down her back.  She wore dull red leather armor, with a bit of flab sticking out around the fastening buckles. Her belly rested on her lap. He could tell she was a bit bigger than the other natives of this village, if only because her thighs covered most of the stool. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve never been to a bar before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron huffed, taking a sip of his drink. A faint hint of the chocolaty liquid lingered on his tongue. His snout crinkled, eventually falling into a frown. \u2018Augh, they call this a stout?\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d The pandaren cocked her head to one side. \u201cIt\u2019s not actually your first time is it? Because I have some good starting drinks-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d He waved a hand at her, \u201cSweeter than I was expecting, was hoping for something with a bit more bite.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want something bitter you should try the Kafa. I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Aaron glanced at her.<br>\r\nShe had turned around to fish in the pack sitting next to her.  \u201c-could probably find something that would work in the meantime. Bitter right?\u201d She shot her gaze up to meet his.<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d He raised an eyebrow, watching her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren only hummed in acknowledgement, rummaging for a few seconds before producing a steel flask and proceeding to shove it in the Worgen\u2019s face. Aaron cautiously took it from her grasp. \u201cTell me what you think of that and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d<br>\r\nHe took a sip, mulling it around for a few seconds before swallowing. Bitter, strong, and thick yet still smooth, this was much closer to what he was looking for. He curled his lips and nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s more my speed. Thank you Miss\u2026\u201d He trailed off, narrowing his eyes slightly. \u2018I really need to be more wary of accepting strange flasks in the future.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJun Cloudstep.\u201d She beamed at him, \u201cGlad you like it. Luckily the ingredients for that are close to town so I can make more in a hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d run off just to make more of this for me?\u201d His gaze switched between the flask and her face.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a brew master. Making beer for people is what I do.\u201d She shrugged, \u201cEveryone deserves to have a good time and a better drink.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised a profession like that exists here.\u201d He remarked flatly, casting his gaze about the tavern.<br>\r\n\u201cOh there are plenty of us,\u201d she began, \u201ca few really famous ones with specialty brews and everything. I know brew master Blanche personally and you won\u2019t believe what-\u201d Aaron paused in his scan as he noticed a combination of waiters and kitchen staff carrying what appeared to be a massive roasted bird that had to be as big as his torso into the dining area. His eyes narrowed, darting to more pandaren clad in aprons carrying out bowls of noodles, stir fries, soups, and platters of rolls and grilled fish along with a sealed keg and a fistful of mugs.  They all appeared to be heading to the same destination. His gaze snapped back to the pandaren next to him, who was waving her arms animatedly \u201c-and lightning is striking every few seconds and she\u2019s screaming at us to put the keg fires out, so we-\u201c.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you excuse me for one moment?\u201d Aaron was standing before he was finished asking, weaving through the crowd on the way back to the girls; he prayed that he had misheard their intention to order a sample of the entire inn\u2019s food stock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Worgen shoved his way through the crowd, stopping at the edge of the table. Wide eyes surveyed the recently delivered roast bird, surrounded by platters of steaming food and tankards full of local brews. He blinked, his gaze turning to the trio of women surrounding the feast fit for twenty five. Two had wasted no time, gleefully devouring the small bowls of noodles and vegetables in seconds. Alissa had seemed to master the use of the tiny wooden sticks the pandaren eat with in record time. Miki had simply resorted to using a fork built into her army knife. Ingrid wasn\u2019t even eating. A tall mug of beer occupied both hands and a spot in her bosom. She took sips out of each one with a practiced precision only a dwarf could have while drunkenly slurring out a Khaz Modan bar shanty. He frowned, eyes running over his compatriot\u2019s disturbingly blank faces as his newest \u2018friend\u2019 caught up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, you guys know how to throw a party.\u201d She remarked, looking over the jovial Dwarf \u201cMind if I join in?\u201d <br>\r\nIngrid spouted off something completely unintelligible to Aaron's ears, but the Brewmaster took this as an invitation to join. Jun nimbly slid into the last seat at the table and snapped the leg off of the bird, filled a stein, and pulled a noodle bowl towards her. \u201cTo new friends!\u201d She said cheerily, raising her mug and downing it in one long swig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron approached the table slowly, acting as if they might eat him next. Up close he could see that most their faces had gone slightly pale. While he could never tell Night Elf skill color, he noticed the lack of red in the gnome\u2019s and dwarf\u2019s faces. Their eyes were dilated and expressions blank, locked on the table. The warrior\u2019s frown deepened as he swept his glance to where their orc captive was, only to find a few strands of torn rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single motion Aaron had swept Miki up by the shirt with a snarl, a furious orange glow creeping into his eyes and lupine ears flat against his skull. \u201cBy the light Miki, did that crash scatter your damned marbles? Where the hell is the orc?\u201d His growling shout boomed through the inn, echoing over the clanking of glasses and dinner conversations. The dangling gnome did not respond, instead reaching feebly for the food left behind on the table. Aaron\u2019s frown turned into a scowl and he shook the rogue violently, \u201cDamnit Miki, that was our last lead!\u201d<br>\r\nThat seemed to get through to her. Miki glanced around numbly, as if she was suffering from shell shock. Her head lulled to the side. \u201cThe\u2026 the orc\u2019s gone? Well go find her AG. I\u2019ll catch up when I\u2019ve dealt with this gnawing hunger.\u201d She rubbed her slightly distended gut with one hand and grabbed for her abandoned fork with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron couldn\u2019t disguise the look of disgust on his face. He let the gnome drop and watched her scramble back to her forcibly abandoned dishes; he looked around the table at the vacant looks of his allied soldiers, the grease and sauce staining their faces. Ingrid had somehow worked a bowl of soup into the mix and her face was a mess of broth and ale. He stopped at Jun, noticing the contented smile on her face and the glisten in her eye as she savored the large roasted bird she was eating. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t be chasing my quarry alone. Jun!\u201d He shouted. The Brewmaster paused, looking at him with her mouth closed around her second drumstick. \u201cYou really want to help?\u201d He waited for her to nod before continuing. \u201cThen saddle up, we had a fugitive to catch.\u201d He took a step towards the door when he heard her emit a muffled huff, causing Aaron to roll his eyes \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a few pints to make up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d She swallowed and swept up her sturdy bamboo staff.  She weaved around the table to his side, and was on his heels. The two left the warmth of the inn, the locals more than willing to make room for him after the show he just put on. Not like the furious warrior noticed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the three women noticed Aaron leave, they made no indication of it. Through serving after serving, they continued to eat. They devoured plates of succulent pig, bird, and tiger along with their beds of rice and even the garnish. Bowls filled with noodles were slurped and swallowed to join the rest of the feast in their guts. Brews, water melon, steamed fish, fresh dumplings, no food lasted long on the table and the brew was imbibed with even greater haste. It was a grand banquet of all Pandaria had to offer, and it would not last the hour. Their purpose existed on this table, the solution to the gnawing hunger plaguing their bodies and thoughts. It was there in every chunk of bird or beast Miki slathered in spicy and tangy sauce, in every steamed dumpling packed with crab that she devoured in one gulp. It was there with Alissa, who still managed to pointedly ignore the dead animals on the table to cram as much wok friend vegetables and noodles into her mouth as she could slurp up, washing down each mouthful with a refreshing gulp of airy brew that never seemed to run out. It was there with Ingrid, whose mastery of the drinking form had won over the attention of many pandaren as they attempted to emulate her three mug stance as if it was a martial art. They paused to cheer when the dwarf kept balance with her dips for soup bowls, offering applause as she swept them up in her mouth and drained the delicious contents without the use of her mug filled hands. The three fed their gluttony, clothes pressing tight as they ate well into the night. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's the most experienced of the three, adept with a glaive and bow, it's good to have her around. Sometimes seen as uptight, the early retiree of the Darnasus guard is bound by honor and loyalty. She's friendly and caring, if a bit brash at times. Her dark violet skin is accented by her starry white hair. She's trimmed and muscled for sure, comfortable among the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIanah Lightseer: powerful and sarcastic mage. She doesn't lack in the humor department, even with her slightly bored demeanor. Ianah knows she's powerful, and she's not humble about it. She aims to make a name for herself and claim what she deserves. Her sense of humor can sometimes be annoying, but overall welcome among the group (well, maybe not with Falindrah as much). Her skin is very dark, a rare trait among her people, but still common enough to not be outlandish. Her bright white eyes stick out in contrast from her otherwise all dark tone (including her black hair).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdienna Lioncrest, a human of noble birth that decided to cast it off in favor of earning it herself. She's a priest in nature, able to use the light for healing, or shadowmagic for smiting. She's kind of heart and willing to help any in need. Somewhat innocent at first, she grew to adapt in the harsh world. Tougher than she used to be, her aim is to prove her personal worth without the aid of her rich family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group is quite fresh and haven't experienced more than a few quests. Though they're bound to at least grow in one way or another by the end of this story... whether it be one of them, or all of them.</span></div></div>",

Gora's sharp featured face now was round with slightly saggy cheeks and triple chin. Her underwear has completely snapped off at this point leaving her all bare. Two large slightly saggy breasts rests atop her huge bloated gut that gave her now a belly apron giving her some decency. Her arms had layers of fat now and her hips had widened to ridiculous extend. Her bare green asscheeks were large and wobbly joining to her thick thighs. Gora never felt so much shame on her appereance before.

So enjoy your last meal since we are going to enjoy a big one today!\" He laughed mockingly towards broken obese blubber of orc.

Lysa, on the other hand, was ready to go after her meal, so Sylvia didn't want to hold her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went off into the forest on their Hawkstriders, making note of their surroundings.

I was struck by the beast and was given this...\" The paladin lifted her bandage to reveal the glowing circles of light, \"Got it last night, and my hunger's been uncontrollable since... hence this.\" She pointed to her curved tummy, packed tight with food. \"Any way you can help me?\" Sylvia asked with a shrug.</span></div></div>",

It only appears in shadows, and has no true physical form in the light. But when it bit a creature, it would cause that creature to be unable to eat any sort of food.\" Magister Dolvarr explained.<br>\r\n\"So what does this have to do with my problem?\" Sylvia asked again.<br>\r\n\"I managed to catch a sample of the creature's DNA, and managed to reverse it. I gave this antidote to everyone in town, as it cancelled out the curse of Starvation with the Curse of Hunger. But, strange enough, it seems as if this Shadow Wolf has evolved into a different breed, one that makes people eternally hungry.\" Magister Dolvarr stated.<br>\r\nSylvia panicked, \"R-really? Well, can't you just reverse the DNA sample you have now and give it to me as a cure?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. DNA can only be reversed once, and since the DNA I have has been reversed already, it will not work. However, if you could catch this Shadow Hound, you may be able to catch some of it's DNA, and it will allow me to create a cure.\" Magister Dolvarr stated.<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. I'll just go out and...\"<br>\r\n\"No! No, you can't do it alone. If you're bitten again, it'll start corrupting your mind and make you think about nothing but eating, and you'll never be cured. You'll need... another.\" Magister Dolvarr mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia could get Lysa to help, but what if they failed to get the DNA? Then she would be stuck forever hungry like she was... she wanted to do this alone and not drag Lysa into this, but she did need another person...</span></div></div>",

I've got my friend from Ratchet coming to install some warning system, so I won't have any more jailbreaks. Until then, I've put you under the guard of my Eye of Kilrogg.

She kept eating, and without realizing it, was gaining inches to her waistline. The enchanted meal quickly packed on pounds to her frame, her stomach growing wider and rounder, a new roll forming on her fatty gut. Her lower half wasn't looking too good either, her rear spreading out below her and thighs growing more thunderous.<br>\r\nWith a belch, Lysa laid back in bed, stuffed to her limits.

I can't say I've seen who you're talking about...\" The woman answered, pulling at her cowl, \"But I have something you could try that might help?\" She clears her throat before continuing, \"It enhances your senses for a time, perhaps that could help.\"<br>\r\nSylvia quickly opened her palm, while Brighthelm hesitated but eventually did the same. The woman dropped a single capsule in both their waiting hands, one orange and one green. \"They both help with different senses, so it's best if both of you take a different one.\" She pair nodded their heads in response, Sylvia taking the green while Brighthelm took the orange. \"Alright, I hope you find... whoever that is...\" The stranger walked past both elves without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we really trust a poultice someone like THAT just gave us?\" Brighthelm questioned, \"She's beyond strange.\"<br>\r\nSylvia grunted, \"Well we don't have much of a choice, do we? Especially if we don't find Lysa, we're in deep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrighthelm thought about it for a good long while, \"You know what, you're right...\" She popped in it her mouth and swallowed, Sylvia doing the same.</span></div></div>",

She dreamt of fattening Lysa beyond mobility, sitting on her belly and hand feeding her. She felt immensely happy, that is until she heard a loud rumbling, waking her from her sleep.

She looked back at Sylvia, who by some miracle was still sleeping despite the ravenous hunger. \"You're a heavy sleeper, Syl.\" She cooed, walking up the stairs to grab a 'light breakfast' She did her best to move slowly, as not to wake up the lady from last night. If she could avert her, she wouldn't have to work for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrighthelm did away with her boots, leaving them at the top of the stairs, she could creep a lot quieter without them. She looked around either corner before continuing. She kept low under the counter, doing a swift action roll into the kitchen, primed to strike... at the food. With the coast clear, she grabbed as much as she could hold, balancing a stack up to her eyes. Walking out towards the basement door quickly on her tippy toes; Brighthelm slowly closed the door, careful not to let the hinges creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrighthelm gave herself a silent cheer as she made it down the steps, \"Still got it.\" She piled the food up next to Sylvia, getting the little prep she needed to do out of the way before waking her. \"Sylviaaaa, breakfast is here!\" She called, slowly brushing her cheek. She noticed her eyes slowly opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, goodmorning Brighthelm...\" She grumbled, tiredness still in her voice, \"How'd you know I was hungry...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just had a feeling.\" The other elf winked, giving Sylvia a pat on the belly.</span></div></div>",

The purple wisps simply chirped in response, a serene little tune emanating from the glowing orbs. \"What's this?\" She asked, a particularly large wisp 'carrying' a necklace of pristine gold, a glowing purple shard faceted in the center, as If it were part of a larger whole. The tune of the wisps only grew louder, though not in an obnoxious manner. Sylvia felt at peace, the large wisp floating behind her and clasping the oddity around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo... Is this for me?\" Sylvia asked, picking up the pendant and inspecting its soft glow. There was no particular answer, though she felt the wisps gave a confirmation. \"Wow, thank you!\" Her voice still in shock and awe by the purple glow and dance of the spirits. The trees all around seemed to team with similar life, \"This is some spiffy night elven stuff!\" She cheered, another wisp appearing, bearing a bracelet of similar craft, intricate gold with a purple shard fixated in the middle. Sylvia brought her arm up into view, gazing in awe at the wisps' gifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serenade of wisps came to a swell, reaching it's climax. Sylvia felt her ragged, torn, and stretched clothes dissipate. She shuddered at the sudden nudity, though brief, a fine silk soon covering her. Looking down, Sylvia was wearing an ornate robe of silk and gold. Though the wisps must've picked a bit of a revealing garment, it fit like a charm, her chubby midriff and a slit of her thighs laying bare.

Her final task was to defeat the demon leading attacks on a local village. The attacks were small, but troublesome none the less for the unarmed villagers. The mission was a bit different than most that her fellow paladins partook in, as this time the information was foggy. Not a lot was known about the demon. Regardless, the trial was pass or fail; either become a certified paladin or get stuck back in training doing grunt duty. Sylvia was hopeful for the most part, but had a feeling it wouldn't go as planned or that it'd flop last minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia Embersworn sat cross-legged on her bunk, folding and packing a spare change of clothes for her journey. She sat with her traveling bag between her legs, already stuffed to the brim with gear. The elf pulled the straps tight and buckled them closed, content with what she was bringing. 'Finally done... I can barely stand waiting any longer...' She mused, laying back down on her bed, drumming either side of the bag with her feet. 'Not only for my sake, but there's as well... I can't afford to fail this.' Sylvia reasoned, further encouraging herself in preparation for the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylvia huffed out a sigh and closed her eyes, the bunkmate below her chimed up, \"SOoo, final trial eh?\" The feminine voice was enough to make Sylvia frown. Of all the people she didn't want to talk to tonight, Brighthelm was certainly on the top of the list. She was practically a prodigy and everyone knew it; especially her. She flew through each of her trials, and the council wants her in a leading roll, preening her for council succession. She was pampered and privileged. The only thing holding her back was her attitude, a superiority complex and a chip on her shoulder, Brighthelm often gave joked on Sylvia's behalf. The prodigy had her moments, oddly standing up for Sylvia given the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm... Hopefully the only time I need to do it.\" Sylvia answered with a hint of annoyance rolling over in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, its alright, not everyone can pass first time.

She scratched her he's and walked in the direction of the barrack's kitchen, her feet still bare on the cold wood flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylvia reached the epicenter of smell, she plopped down in her chair at the table. \"Good morning, Lysa.\" Sylvia gestured over to the elf spicing and preparing the final parts of what looks to be a rather large meal. \"Looks like you're out here early,\" she poured a glass of juice before continuing, \"Aiming to flex your culinary muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's about right,\" Lysa was starting to pull the meat she had prepared off the spit, \"I'm making sure little-miss-soon-to-be-paladin gets a proper send off.\" She said, turning from her work to flash Sylvia a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysa and Sylvia were both good friends, they both joined at the same time and clicked right off the bat. The fast friends were both ecstatic about joining and becoming paladins. However, as training went on, the two were forced to do simple work at the barracks from time to time, and their overall positions changed. Lysa was assigned to cooking for a few weeks, and in that time she discovered her love for cooking. Lysa requested to take over as barrack chef, which ended up being quite popular with everyone after she'd proven how good it all tasted.  The career path did stunt her drive to become a paladin however, swapping training time for cooking practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the cooking she'd been doing, Lysa wasn't quite the thinnest elf... She got in the habit of taste testing everything she made, slowly but surely adding to her frame. She stuck out among her people, chubby by most standards; sporting a pudgy potbelly and a round backside, only matched by thick thighs. Not to say she wasn't very pretty, as she was. Her hair a crimson red, a soft and welcoming face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're making a rather big send-off, huh?\" Sylvia smiled at her friend and sipped on her drink. Lysa washed her hands clean and loaded Sylvia's plate high, untying her apron before walking over and setting it down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A traveler needs to eat, and as they say! Its the most important meal of the day.\" She pointed up at the air and nodded her head resolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true... But this might only tempt me to stay,\" Sylvia eyed the food, taking in its divine scent, \"Dont be offended if I dont finish it all.\" Sylvia looked back up at the chubby elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I wont be offended... Just slightly sad.\" Lysa joked, chuckling at Sylvia's show of concern. \"But eat up, dont want you to be late.\" She walked back over to the food, getting another plate prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm, orders received.\" Sylvia threw a salute, getting her hands on her utensils as Lysa came walked back with a loaded plate...</span></div></div>",

How do you eat this much so easily, Lysa...\" Sylvia trailed off, leaning back in her chair cradling an overfed ball of a middle. She managed to eat all of her friend's meal without realizing it until it was too late. Now she was left groaning, the bottom of her shirt riding up. Lysa still sat across from her, plate cleaned long before with a smile. Sylvia could see that Lysa was slightly bloated under her shirt, but nearly as much as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're just a wimpy light weight,\" she teased, seemingly unaffected by the amount of food she ate, \"I can handle a good meal is all.\" The two exchanged laughs, while Lysa collected plates for washing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia felt like she was going to pop, her stomach wasn't used to such large capacity. \"Yeah, I think all of Silvermoon could predict that ability.\" Sylvia joked, slowly getting to her feet with aid from her chair. Once she was upright, Sylvia looked almost cartoonish; round stuffed belly stuck on a small thin frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you better get goin fatty,\" a familiar voice came from behind, \"you're already late.\" Brighthelm pointed behind with her thumb as Sylvia turned. She had a smug grin, aiming her eyes on Sylvia's ball of a stomach, \"A butterball won't make I into the order you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, not in the mood...\" Sylvia slowly pushed past her peer in the direction of her bunk, popping open her footlocker. \"But you're right, I need to hurry...\" She admitted, pulling her clothes and armor out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm, maybe if you didn't stuff your face for 2 hours...\" Brighthelm sat on her bunk with a sigh, \"You need to be more responsible Syl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, and stop calling me that.\" Sylvia quickly slipped off her night clothes and pulled on her shirt and pants. She started getting her armor on, at least the pieces she could do herself. She made sure each belt was on tight, making sure no piece were to fall off. The lower body was no problem... That I until she got to the belt. Her usual length was far too uncomfortable, she needed to bring it up quite a few extra notches and even then it was partly painful. Her chestplate was going to be an issue, it wasn't something she could do alone; each strap ws either on her side or on her back. \"Brighthelm... Give me a hand, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrighthelm perked her long ear, \"My help?\" Sylvia nodded, \"Alright, sure.\" She got up from her sitting position to behind Sylvia, each hand holding a side belt. She tightened the straps harshly, pinching Sylvia's sensitive midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww... Careful...\" The elf winced, her belly tightly packed inside her plate gear. \"Easy on the back ones, please.\" Which Brighthelm surprisingly obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're no fun Syl.\" The superior ranked paladin chuckled, \"Go on now, don't fail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Sylvia walked to the stables with her bag hoisted over her shoulder. 'I'm only a little late, no big deal.' She reassured herself, mounting her paladin steed. 'But this is going to be a hard ride...' She gulped, patting her belly in concern for how comfortable her journey would be.</span></div></div>",

She'd just got a new bikini - a red-and-white striped number - and she didn't want even one extra square inch of her skin covered while she sunbathed.  It wasn't that she was worried about tanning unevenly.  In fact, given the clouds of pollution hanging above Kezan, there was little chance of tanning at all.   Tanning wasn't why she was here on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was... well, you might call it fishing.  But she wasn't after the poison-soaked fish bobbing belly up in the oily ocean waters.  She had much juicier prey in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, there's a nice one,\" her sister Jillitrice said, nudging Trimsy and pointing down the beach.  \"Just look at those muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimsy snorted in the direction of the burly goblin man.  \"Muscles like that come from doing<i> work</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm</i> after a man of means.  The only muscles I want to see are the ones in his counting fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJilli took another lick of her Kajaberry ice cream.  \"Why?  Daddy gives us scads of money.   Wouldn't you rather have those big strong arms wrapped around you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimsy pulled her sunglassed down her delicately pointed nose and looked over them, making no attempt to hide the way she was sizing up her sister's figure.  \"The way you're stuffing down those ice creams, you'll <i>need</i> a man with strong arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJilli blushed and pulled her knees up to her chest, letting her dark hair fall over her face.  \"It's only my second cone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when, the start of this conversation?\"  Trimsy laughed.  \"Oh, don't get upset!  I'm only joking around.   You know I love you no matter how fat you are.  Now keep your eyes open, would you?  I heard a rumor that a trade prince was going to be on the beach today, and I need to know when you spot him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't <i>you</i> look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimsy settled back in the sand, eyes closed.   \"I don't want him to think I'm here <i>waiting</i> for him or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a commotion erupted at the far end of the beach.   Excited voices rang out, along with the flashes, snaps, and occasional small explosions of numerous goblin cameras.   Jilli pointed out to sea.  \"Look, Trimsy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimsy sat up.  An enormous yacht was plowing through the gummy surf, dislodging oil drums and old, deactivated mines.  In contrast to the general dinginess of the beach (which was, after all, <i>public</i>--yech) the ship gleamed with a fresh coat of paint and wax and was bedecked with so much polished chrome and copper it was a miracle it wasn't sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that ship!\"  Trimsy said with excitement in her voice.  \"That's Wix Bustlevug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The candy guy?\" Jilli asked, blinking.  \"Is he rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The top confectionary distributor worldwide,\" Trimsy corrected.  \"And with girls like you around, of course he's rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well--who knows, maybe he'd like a girl like me better than someone who doesn't appreciate his life's work,\"  Jilli smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrimsy smirked and stood up, arcing her back and inhaling until her bikini top strained against her chest.  \"I guess we'll find out, won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJilli stood up next to her and struck the same pose, pulling in her gut and sucking air into her lungs until she almost squeaked.   Trimsy goggled.  Suddenly her sister's unfashionable blue one-piece was loose around the middle and tight to the point of bursting around her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You--you--I saw him first, you tramp!\"  she snapped.   \"So don't even think about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of us has seen him,\" Jilli pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-well--shut up!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another cool evening at the harbor. Lexli once again found herself in a tavern spending money she didn't earn. She loved Ratchet. Major seaports meant lots of pockets from all over the world. Who knew what she might find in some poor shlub's coinpurse. She did have to give Gazlowe some credit though. His bruisers most certainly did lift. \"They must be juicing on demon blood or something, I swear,\" Lexli murmured before hailing a bar wench. \"Can I get a south island iced tea over here?\" she snapped her fingers and held up one green finger. The buxom, gold-green goblin wench nodded and tucked a strand of her purple hair behind her curled ears. Lexli surveyed the tavern, ever eager for her next mark. But before she even got her drink, a human man in a hooded, dusty brown cloak sat down opposite her at the shipswheel-shaped table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evenin', Lex,\" he said in a warm, sandy voice. With a flourish of his cloak he produced a sealed scroll and laid it on the table. The peridot pilferer shifted in her seat. Lexli let out a nervous laugh and slid from the wooden seat. A leather-gloved hand seized her slim arm and held fast. He shook his head and guided her back to her seat. \"No, I'm afraid you're not leavin' just yet, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastian, old buddy old pal, how <i>have</i> you been?\" Lexli beamed a sharp, toothy grin at the man. He had a beard now. The mercenary always had a certain, rugged charm to him, but Lexli shunted such thoughts for the moment. \"You know, I think I still owe you that drink from before--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You owe more than that, Lex,\" Bastian began and the goblin followed his gaze over the various, unusual characters to pass through Ratchet, \"and I reckon you owe a good deal more since you sank your teeth into this town,\" he scoffed and released her arm. No one seemed to hear their argument, but Lexli's ears drooped some all the same. Bastian pointed at the scroll on the table. \"I offered to play courier and track down your green ass,\" he said, \"because I knew the terms if you failed. Mikkel is out for blood, Lex. You ripped off the wrong alchemist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she smirked, \"it wasn't the first time I've ripped off the dead.\" Lexli leaned over the table and scooped up the scroll. She confirmed the wax seal to belong to Mikkel Duskworm of the Royal Apothecary Society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not too dead to send out legbreakers,\" Bastian replied with no sign of a smile. \"I still worry about you sometimes, and I don't want to hear you end swimiming with the makrura,\" he added. Six months ago Lexli learned about a shipment of rare herbs flying out of Stranglethorn on a zeppelin. She slipped into the cargo hold the night before the departure and swapped the herbs out with ordinary peacebloom. Boy was Mikkel pissed. Finally relenting, Lexli nodded and cracked open the scroll before hastily scanning the script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the Amulet of Amalgamir?\" she raised a pierced eyebrow and continued reading. The letter mentioned the necklace possessed odd magic, something about transmutations, but Lexli was most pleased reading about wiping away her debt in one stroke. She found a crude map scrawled at the bottom of the parchment, but little else about the prized treasure itself. Bastian sat with his arms folded and shrugged when the little goblin looked up. \"Let me guess, you're just the delivery boy?\" her brows fell unamused. He nodded with the utmost neutrality. \"Thank you <i>so</i> much, Sebastian,\" the pint-size rogue slid down from her chair and tucked the letter and enclosed map into her adventuring backpack. \"So I'm supposed to sneak into Razorfen and steal some fancy necklace?\" she asked only to receive another silent shrug. \"This will be enough to clear my debt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what the letter says?\" Bastian tilted his head, offering the goblin no insight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why didn't they just send a bird to deliver this? It wouldn't be any less helpful than you, you old lug,\" Lexli bared her teeth in a mischievous grin. Bastian mockingly shook a fist. At last the busty golden goblin returned with the south island iced tea, placing it down in front of Lexli. \"About time.\" She flashed an innocent smile at the waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be ten silver,\" the wench held out a hand, and Lexli looked to Bastian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-- well my drinking buddy here said he'd buy me a round for old time's sake,\" Lexli spouted, offering the courier a barrage of batting blue eyes. He frowned, rolled his eyes, and nodded to the wench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open a tab for me, would you, doll? I'll have a bourbon,\" Bastian winked and the golden goblin walked off. \"Only one, now, I'm working,\" he offered Lexli a stony, reserved expression. She held up the scroll and shook it in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just punched out for the day,\" back into the pack it went, and the thief leaned over the table, pressing  her hands under her modest bust, \"unless I'm not enough goblin for you,\" she stuck her tongue between her pillowy, black lips and winked. She bobbed her head toward the waitress now beyond ear shot. \"I could never do what I do with those things.\" This earned another eyeroll from Bastian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get ahead of yourself, kid,\" he mused. After several hard drinks, many laughs, and a lengthy, fevered debate over the better faction Brewfest, Lexli and Bastian decided to hold their own drinking competition. Five pints of ale down, and they started to draw a crowd. Many of the tavernfolk gathered around in astonishment at the gluttonous goblin. By now the lithe and nimble goblin gal sported a significant potbelly. The hem of her leather jerkin rode up over a crescent moon of taut, green flesh. Lexli winced and rubbed a hand over her bloated tummy. It gurgled in protest of the foolish game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the seventh pint she wiped her foamy lips on the back of her hand and erupted into another thunderous belch. A holler of applause and laughter filled the thick, tavern air. Eight down, nine down, and then Lexli's head dropped to the table. The forty-five pound goblin held her own against the unfairly larger man, and after some more laughs and sighs the crowd dispersed. By now the candles grew low and many of the patrons left for their rooms or their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go get some shut eye,\" Bastian said with a slur as he shook the swollen goblin, \"the amulet isn't going anywhere tonight.\" Lexli expelled a sickly, wet belch and sloshed out of her chair on unsteady feet. With a hiccup she fell back onto her rump, sending the dome of her leatherbound belly wobbling. Lexli groaned and shuffled off to her room. Tomorrow she'd have some hard choices to make. And one of them would be some exercise to work off all the booze...</span></div></div>",

Merchants and guards all of them going to their posts as Lexli parks her trike at the outskirt of the Crossroads walking in the town. Goblin lady looking over buff guards as they salute her as she passes them, Lexli heads towards the town inn to greet its patron. \"Heya got good meal for hungry traveller?\" Lexli greets big tauren before her. \"Greetings goblin.
