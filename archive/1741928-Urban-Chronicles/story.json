It suddenly forms into a spindly creature on four legs.  It's body had four yellow eyes, burning through the dark alley.  Seth started to back away, but too late.  Soon the creature came at him, nimbly speeding.  Seth ran but felt a leg press him down.  A spike shot out of another leg and Seth watched in horror as it flew towards him.  Somehow, he brought his hand up and caught the leg, inches from his throat.  He used all his strength and twisted and felt the foot break off.  More goo spurted like black blood from where the leg was.  He stabbed the other leg with his new weapon and it recoiled.  Seth got up, holding his new weapon.  He pulled his math book from a newly ripped hole in his backpack and held into infront of him.  Fleeing won't work, but killing will.  Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at the thing he would soon start to refer to as a Spider.  In the background, Gate Tower stood, lights shining, no doubt unaware of the 17 year old fighting for his life.  He blocked a stab from a leg and it became caught in the book.  He tanked, causing it to overbalance.  It hit the ground and Seth stabbed out one eye.  It reared, standing on 3 regular and one short leg.  It sent a whack from its broken leg into Seth's chest.  Seth recoiled and blocked another stab.  Thus leg came out and it stayed up.  The math book was falling apart and Seth knew he would die if it did.  Seth ran back and grabbed a garden hose.  He ran around the monster, leaving it circled by hose.  He used the math book to whack the wounded leg and it fell.  He quickly tied a knot to make the circle of hose stay together.  The Spider stood, and Seth pulled the loop tight.  Its legs got tied together and, trying to break out, it fell.  Seth stabbed out the other eyes, leaving it blind.  The hose broke, and it scrambled up, swinging at random.  Seth bucked a rock down the alley and it charged at the sound.  It hit a fence and fell over.  Seth ran over to it and stabbed it over and over again in the body.  It stood, but Seth continued to attack until it fell again.  It melted back to the black goo, which steamed until seemingly evaporating.  \"Holy crap.  What was that thing?\" Seth asked, though nobody was there to hear it.

They each stepped on a square and he felt like his mind cleared.  A wall rose between them and he heard a few faint pounds.  Melody told them they needed to pass a test with barricades and holograms.  Then weapons appeared.  He looked at his choices before grabbing two submachine guns.  \"Any test with guns should be fun.  I'm ready!\" the wall in front of him revealed a half-mile long obstacle course with hologram Antis and insane obstacles.  \"Why couldn't this be a firing range?\" Seth muttered.  \"There is no time limit.  If complete it without dying, you pass.\" Seth looked at the traps.  \"Is that a pit of fire?  And what is that huge lump over there?\" Seth asked, slightly regretting his choice.  He started to walk, shooting down an Anti from a distance.  He reached the rock wall and pulled himself up.  The Anti at the top was yanked down and the resounding goo splatter was a sure sign the Anti was dead.  He looked down and sure enough, it was dead.  Seth slid down the other side of the wall and shot a few more Antis.  He jumped over the previously mentioned pit of fire and shot the Antis off a bridge.  He continued, clearing a few obstacles and after 30 minutes, was about to finish.  \"Oh God.  The lump can't be...\" the lump began to move and became a huge creature with many arms, each with something sharp and dangerous.  Seth pumped clip after clip of shots into every part of it but it didn't work, the skin was too thick.  He immediately began to close in, hoping he would kill it.  He remembered the claw, still tucked into his belt.  He smashed it down on one of the arms and felt it slice through.  It screeched in pain but Seth slashed another.  He dodged swipes from its 22 remaining limbs, which began to tangle, cutting a few more arms in the process.  It had now 15 arms, most of which higher on its slug-shaped body.  Seth cut one arm down to where it stemmed from the body.  He reached in, holding a gun, and fired into it.  It fell into a huge puddle of goo, which evaporated.  Seth raised his arms up and then walked to the finish line.  The obstacle course evaporated and the adrenaline which carried Seth to the end ran out.  He fell, exhausted but victorious.</span></div></div>",

You watch Tsubaki perform those strange hand seals as Drago then falls to sleep. Jin then casts the spell in which shows what Drago is seeing. You see the image change into an empty town. All the buildings are white and there is no sound whatsoever. You watch as Drago begins walking through the town as shadows move out of the corner of the image. Drago looks at a large window of a shop and sees his reflection move even though he isn't moving. Drago begins chasing this specter through the town until he reaches a large courtyard and sees its dark shape on top of a building. It drops from the roof top and approaches you. It looked more demonic then when you first encountered it back at Gate City. It was the same height as Drago but it had menacing claws, demonic wings, spikes raking from the back of its head down its back and a long whip-like spike tipped tail. \"Oh wow.\u201d Jai says \u201cThat demon is more uglier then I remembered it.\" \"See Donald?\" Del says to you \"That demon feeds on fear.\" You just nod as you watch the rest of the image play out. \"Do you really think you can defeat me?\" The Anti Drago says. \"Yes.\" Drago replies. \"Fine we will fight somewhere where you are more comfortable.\" The Anti says. The image changes to a tunnel with a wooden door. Drago is dressed in gladiator armor. It consisted of a pair of boots with holes for his claws, knee guards, shorts, chest guard, shoulder pad on his right arm, two guards on his upper and lower left arm and a helmet. He is wielding a spear in his right hand and a short sword sheathed above his tail. The door opens and Drago walks into the open arena greeted by cheering from a large crowd. Drago's infected self standing opposite him. The fight will now begin. You, Del, Jai and Kiba begin cheering on for Drago as the two Drago's start circling.

Drago just says nothing but the Anti takes this opportunity and slashes at Drago leaving a large tear across his chest guard. Drago then snaps out of it. The Anti whips his tail at Drago only to be blocked by his spear as he grabs it with his tail throwing it away. \"Come on Drago, don't get distracted.\" Jai says. Both swords clash again bringing both Drago and the Anti to face. \"Do you really think this exorcism will work Drago?\" The Anti asks, \"I might be gone but I am part of you. I am every dark notion, idea and thought you ever had, I am the things you left behind closed doors.\" Both swords are knocked away from the force of the clash. He gives Drago a dirty punch to the gut. \"Ooh, a sucker punch. Not good.\" you say. Drago remains standing due to the fact that as soon as one fighter is on the ground the other one can kill them. Drago and the Anti grabs each other, \"Hmm, both of them are evenly matched.\" Del says \"It's anybodies game.\" \"I hope it's Drago's.\" replies Kiba. They release each other and go for the swords. Drago gets there first and kicks his sword away. He swings again at him. He evades the slash and fights back with his tail which went through his lower chest. He turns away from Drago and looks for praise from the crowd which he gets. Drago picks up his spear and with one quick movement he shoulders him to the ground. He turns him over onto his back and keep him down with his foot on his chest. Drago looks up to the crowd to seek judgment. Each member turns their thumbs down. You all pass the same judgment. \"You can kill me now Drago,\" the Anti says, \"but I will be back as soon as you give into your dark emotions.

Drago shoots it in the back as it falls down he pumps the shotgun and shoots it again as it fades away. \"So are we done here?\" Drago asks. \"A professsor came in while you were out cold.\" Solivani said \"He dropped thisss.\" You all look at what seems to be a detonator. \"He left instructionsss with it.\" Solivani continued. You looked at the piece of paper. The letter reads \u201cDonald, this detonator is a worm hole bomb. It will create a permanent ripple that can be accessed by IDP members.

Everyone seemed happier hearing this especially you. \"How about we finally get back to HQ.\" Drago says. \"Let's.\" Jai says.

The seven of you split up checking the surrounding area. You carry the detonator as look around the area but you so far find nothing. Before you leave you see something in the bushes. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d you say drawing your sword. Then all of a sudden you see a shadow reach from the bush and wrap around you keeping you in place. As you struggle you see the one girl you saw from that one fight. \u201cYOU!\u201d you yell \u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d \u201cDaddy said to pick one of you for me to make me a new friend.\u201d The Girl said completely unfazed by your anger \u201cAnd I chose you.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean!?\u201d you shout still trying to brake free.

You feel drained as you try to stay on your feet. \u201cAs a thank you take this as a gift.\u201d the girl says holding a strange device \u201cEnjoy.\u201d She tosses it and it sticks to the detonator and she vanishes into a black portal.

You see a Drago when he was little was being scolded by his father. As he left the room you heard his mother speak to him. \"Why must you always be so hard on him?\" Drago's mother asks \"you act as if you don\u2019t even want him.\" \"That's because I don\u2019t.\" his father says back \"All he is and ever will be is a mistake between me and another woman before we met.\" \"Is that how you feel about our other children?\" his mother asks. \"No.\" he replies, \"They were planned, they are the ones who might actually make me proud and amount to something.\" \u201cThat\u2019s just cruel.\u201d You think. \"Guess that\u2019s why you hate him.\" Sven says. The screen faded as another memory appeared. <br>\r\nAge: Fourteen. You saw Drago standing on a cliff. \"I remember this.\" Sven said. You watched as he nervously looked over to a younger Red and Sven who smiling. \"You can do this.\" they call over to him as he ran and leaped off the cliff. Drago's wings opened and for the first time he was flying. <br>\r\nAge: Seventeen. He graduated college that day and signed up for a career in the military. It then changed to later in that year. He was patrolling a village where many residents were being executed for counts of conspiracy many houses were being burnt to the ground. \"Kaiser.\" his Sergeant called. \"Yes Sir.: Drago replied instantly. \"Come here.\" His sergeant said. He followed him into a large house. There was a ladder leading to the attic. \"Check up there.\" he said. \"Affirmative.\" Drago replied climbing the ladder. Once up there you see about thirty children and about half as many adults. They all looked at him. \"Kaiser, is there anything up there?\" his Sergeant called. They stared at him, he saw in the low light fear in their eyes awaiting your response. \"Nothing here sir,\" you called down \"all empty.\" He climbed down the ladder and his squad left. The memory changed to a firefight between Drago's patrol unit and enemies. The three other members of his squad and Drago was captured and made Prisoners of War. In the prison it was horrible. They made wear a steel muzzle to prevent breathing fire and they never removed it so he couldn't eat so he was pretty much starved. Eventually his team was freed. He immediately returned home as he was gone for nine months. He was told to get to the hospital. The view changed to him entering a hospital room. A female dragon lying in the bed crying out in agony. She looked at him surprised. Eventually everything was over and the doctor handed the baby to him and said here\u2019s your son. You and the others looked at him and smiled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drago is walking home late at night when he noticed that someone was following him. After reaching a clearing between buildings he turns around to confront this person. It was a hooded figure and he then ran at Drago unsheathing two daggers. Drago fought with the assailant but he jammed the first dagger into Drago\u2019s leg and put the other one straight through his heart. The assassin ran away leaving Drago to die. Everything around Drago froze as a creature shrouded in darkness approached his dying body. \u201cYou want revenge, don\u2019t you?\u201c the creature asked. Drago then nodded. \u201cVery well Kaiser follow me.\u201d The creature said as a black portal opened behind him. Drago staggered after him as he walked through. The memory shifts to the next day. Drago\u2019s uncle walked through the street surrounded by guards, as Drago watched from the rooftops with the two daggers in hand. Drago looked at his daggers seeing that they were as sharp as they were in that memory. He followed his uncle until there were many witnesses to watch him die. Drago walked off the edge of the building and approached him.<br>\r\nDrago called to him and he froze as he heard his voice. Drago knew that his Uncle was the one who ordered the assassin to kill him. \u201cI challenge you to a duel.\u201d Drago said. Drago\u2019s uncle agreed, a stupid mistake. \u201cThey both fought with swords.\u201c After knocking his sword away Drago dropped his sword and stabbed him with the daggers. He walked away leaving him to die. As you walked into an alley way the creature appeared again. \u201cYou got your revenge.\u201d the creature said \u201cNow do I have your allegiance?\u201c \u201cYes Phantom.\u201d Drago replied. The memory shifted to Drago and three others on one knee with a sword in front of each of them. As Phantom entered he ordered each of them to stand. \u201cRise Necro, Shade, Kaiser, Negative. You four have proven yourselves to be my best students.\u201c The memory then changed to Drago and the others and Drago were badly wounded and they were trying to help him. \u201cLeave him.\u201d Phantom ordered \u201cHe\u2019s served his purpose.\u201d As Negative stood up you see Drago attached a small explosive device to him. \u201cSo that\u2019s why Negative is a spirit that possessed Shaun.\u201d you think.

His nose is straight, but thick and sturdy to compliment his chiseled jawline that is obscured slightly by a trimmed French cut beard that goes very well with his chocolate hair, cut in a tight fade, looking much better than he would with a jarhead cut. He stands at six-foot three, one-ninety-five pounds molded on a solidly built frame supporting broad shoulders and thick arms, muscles compact and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's a crack shot with pistols and rifles. Can be jolly, but doesn't appreciate anyone messing with him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A helicopter zooms overhead at 120 miles per hour. Trailing behind is a black scaled dragon, somehow capable of keeping up with the rotorcraft, cutting through the difference in the fast, banking turns to close the distance. As it draws nearer, the chopper's left side door slides open revealing a human figure bracing against the air pressure and the sound of music resonating within the metallic bird. The intro riff just started, coinciding with the start of a battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, we've got a Myth on our tail!\" informs a voice over your earpiece. \"Right on top of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it, Sheppard. Hit the brakes and get in low between the skyscrapers,\" you order. \"Russ, get on the left gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna bottleneck them in the skylines?\" asks the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. We've got to drive these guys off before we get to the hangar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Heading in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u266a<i>Naa Na-na Naa. Na-na Naa Na-na Naa</i>\u266b</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniguns on both sides of the chopper were locked and loaded. You just had to grab it, aim, and pull the trigger. The seven spinning barrels immediately unleashed a hail of lead punctuated by the tracers. Dragon hide could not stand the power of a .30 cal cannon spitting out three-thousand rounds per minute. The tailing dragon had slowed down to breathe two rapid fireballs that missed as the chopper jinked around a building, the flames ripping into the glass side. The tracers found their mark and tore into the dragon's side and it could no longer maneuver away from the decelerating craft. It managed to swerve once, twice, but then it passed through the stream and its body contorted and flew apart in a cloud of giblets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got him!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u266a<i>Naa Na-na Naa. Na-na Naa Na-na Naa</i>\u266b</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't the last of 'em!\" calls Russ. \"More Myths coming around the buildings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concentrate on those coming in from the sides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">I got a certain little girl she's on my mind<br>\r\nNo doubt about it she looks so fine<br>\r\nShe's the best girl that I ever had<br>\r\nSometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot had taken you down in between the buildings flying steady with as much speed as he could manage with the large, flying lizards swarming in from all sides. They wouldn't dive in from above, their unnatural speed would drive them into the ground if they missed, and they would be mangled in the rotor if they hit. Their only options were to make passes with their fire breath or shoot in from the sides. Their speed, however, carried them into wide turns that exposed them to either of the turrets. The creatures that must have thought themselves invincible were torn apart in midair before their carcasses plummeted downwards in the most ungraceful fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's another one!\" you scream over the radio playing \"Hush\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cooling systems on the turrets, a smart shooter could dish out the damage without overheating the barrels, running out of ammunition was the greater concern. This one was big, however, a giant armored beast and the stream that Blake poured into its side seemed to have no effect before the dark debris of shattered scaled flew off its mass. It roared in what could only be pain and the mighty wings still beat harder to push it upwards right as the bullets tore into flesh followed by the pulsing red vapor trails of blood and its trajectory leveled before smashing into a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right gun is cooling down,\" you call across to Russ, the heat gauge flashing a caution. Another red one makes a charge for the chopper from the four o'clock, missing by only a yard. \"Russ, Myth on your side, flying in from the rear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it before you said it,\" Russ replies over your earpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right gun is back up,\" you announce as the heat gauge normalizes. You lay it onto another dragon, it too dropping in a few seconds after the tracers ignited the firebladder and it disappeared in cloud of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Hush, hush<br>\r\nI thought I heard her calling my name now<br>\r\nHush, hush<br>\r\nShe broke my heart but I love her just the same now\u266a\u266b</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smaller black one flies in around from the front, pulling ahead of the chopper and spitting blue projectile flames that pass so close you can feel their heat. The chopper pulls up right beside the lizard while it passes right over the rooftops. You draw a bead on the dragon and deliver a package of lead that causes it to tumble through a penthouse cafe, its firebladder exploding in a great blast that demolishes the remaining skeleton of the adjacent building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Did you see that?\" cries Sheppard over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, their getting in too close!\" Koram tells you. \"Take these guys out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheppard, thatch it to keep them off our ass, but keep it steady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\u266a\u266b(Love, love)<br>\r\nWell, I want that, need it<br>\r\n(Love, love)<br>\r\nOh, I gotta gotta have it</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chopper banks left and you can see two come out of the sun and one pulling up from behind. Twisting right, you let off a volley in the direction of the rear dragon. Maybe a few hit it, but he turns sharply and disappears behind the Blackhawk's tail. You return your fire to the two above, the upward angle giving you a perfect attack on their belly scales, one then the other tumbling wildly from the skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah! Fuck!\" Russ screams just as the chopper shakes violently and wanes left. You lose you footing for a second and slip backwards, your grip on the turret's handle preventing you from falling into the other gunner, or rather the maw of an angry, bloodied dragon. It latched onto the side of the Blackhawk, claws screeching against the metal and ripped turret no. 2 right off its bolted frame. You can see Koram had pulled the gunner to safety with the paw that was not holding on to keep both from falling out. Russ had drawn his weapon and was firing into the attacker as it gave a deafening roar once the burst popped one of its eyes and it let go. The chopper stabilized and Russ was able to find his own support, closing the door that could no longer protect the left flank. \"Goddamn! Can't this thing go any faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheppard, punch it,\" you command the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to tell me how to fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no protection on the left flank, the chopper flew in closer towards the buildings on its left to leave the best approach to the right. Sure enough, two more dragons began to charge into the new opening, somehow at the incredible speeds you'd seen before. Shooting off a volley at a distance, one of the black shapes began diving, the other holding it's heading even as it got in range and it was ripped apart, the lifeless body arching downwards to splatter across a rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>\u266a\u266bHush, hush<br>\r\nThought I heard her calling my name now<br>\r\nHush, hush<br>\r\nI need her loving and I'm not to blame now</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The drop zone is five-hundred meters ahead,\" Sheppard informs, \"but I can't land if these Myths stay on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Circle around to the left as you ascend,\" you tell him, \"and keep her steady; I want a clear shot once we are in the open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, flames erupted right in front of you. The dragon that had dove down was coming in from below and breathing a stream of fire at the bottom of the Blackhawk. The craft shook again. The lizard had bashed itself against the chopper, but now its dazed flight has drifted right into your sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got another one!\" you confirm, once it too drops from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chopper began to gain altitude as Sheppard circled the building that had been your objective. Your view was still towards the city, as you watched for any attempts on the craft by any more dragons. They seemed to have backed off, whatever traces that remained weaving back in between the buildings, giving up the chase though you were the most exposed now. Finally, your ears could take a rest from the roar of the machine gun, smoking barrels coming to a rest. Except for the thrum of the rotor, the whine of the engine, and that damn radio Russ had brought along was still blaring his rock music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Russ, turn that off,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music dies. While you keep a watch, the men start to cool down, Russ breathing a sigh of relief heard through your earpiece. \"Looks like they've broken off. Man, some welcoming party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure know how to roll out the red carpet,\" Koram quips. \"...Animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Russ grunts in response. \"I've never seen an animal move like that before. This place is out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly why we're here,\" you say bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tally-ho, boys,\" Sheppard announces, \"drop zone on the nose, four-hundred meters above the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now high above the city streets and as the chopper came around from its circle, you could the top of the Gate Trans-Dimensional Travels Agency building, the hangar built into the top floor open enough to let the Blackhawk to land inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>       Daimon was part of the military presence in Gate City. Recently, the number of attacks by inter dimensional beings had skyrocketed and needed more than the police to keep things in check. Daimon was always on edge, since he'd been here he'd seen things here that he never wanted to see again. He thought of this city as his own private Hell. In the past few days, Daimon had barely had enough time to sleep. Too many attacks for even his contingent to deal with. He was lying on the cot when an alarm rang. Groaning, he rolled over and grabbed his rifle. Its bulk was reassuring, and contributed to the weight of his armor to make him feel a little safer. His best buddy, Brennan, ran by and yelled \"Hell yeah, it's on now baby! We're gonna take these things to school Daimon! Whoo!\" Brennan never seemed concerned, and his huge size might have contributed to that. They both got into their APC and drove off down the streets. When people saw the convoy of three APCs, they cleared out of the street very fast. Shutters closed and doors locked on every side, and Daimon was acutely aware of how silent all had gone. Turning on the radio, he said \"What are we even looking for command?\"<br>\r\n     \"Something around Penitence square, Daimon. Not enough survivors to get a good description. Only ones who got away were the ones right by things away from the statues.\" A cool voice said over the radio. From the voice and the time, Daimon guessed that the operator was Solen, another friend of Brennan, who Daimon acted like an asshole towards. It was nothing personal against her, just how he acted in general. \"If there are no survivors, why are there three APCs and no tanks or a damn helicopter?\" Daimon said, not quite angry. He was casually searching the shadows as the approached the square. He could hear Solen begin to say something but his thoughts snapped off everything as a massive shape lunged from the center of the plaza into the lead APC. The explosion left spots in Daimon's eyes. He dived out of the hatch and fired into this demonic shape. Different parts of it lit up, and a strange howl came from the beast. It seemed to get even larger, and then a disfigured arm flew over Daimon's head, it smashed into a building behind him. The structure collapsed, cutting off the last APC. Daimon, Brennan, and the other soldier in their ride were all alone without backup. This thing was oozing something from its body. Daimon hoped it was blood, and he dived out of the APC, hoping to finding some better cover. He finally opted for a solid chunk of concrete that had fallen when the building collapsed. Daimon pulled a personal weapon off his back. It looked like a demented squirt gun, but far freakier. Daimon pulled the trigger, and the barrel became illuminated. In seconds, a burst of brilliant light erupted from the gun. The laser burned the creature's chest, and it leapt into the air, and flew off. Daimon was left panting, and realized the gun was sizzling hot. Brennan climbed out of the armored car, and looked at Daimon. His face was concerned. Daimon wondered why, when he touched his side and felt blood. Right before he collapsed, he thought 'I'm gonna ruin this armor,' and all faded black.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     When Daimon opened eyes his first thought was 'Not dead'. His second was 'water'. His throat was intensely dry, and he felt like he was burning up. There seemed to be some frenzied activity outside, but that didn't really matter. What did was the bandage around his stomach. It itches, it was glaringly white and he didn't need it. Daimon tried to sit up and call for someone, but then someone entered. It was Solen, the controller. She looked harried, and was wearing full combat armor. \"How'd they drag you from your desk Solen? Sudden suicidal urges? Maybe to see the sights?\" Daimon asked rudely, but meaning no offense. However, his attempts to make conversation weren't even annoying Solen, she was too distraught.<br>\r\n     \"Can you walk?\" she asked. As a response, Daimon got up and grabbed his normal fighting clothes he had spotted in a closet. He walked into the bathroom and changed, and got some water. He emerged a minute later looking like he'd never gotten struck by concrete shards. Solen looked visibly relieved about this. She handed him a rifle that had been lying against the door. Just then Brennan sauntered in, and his eyes popped at the gun.<br>\r\n     \"I didn't know they let pop guns in the hospital! Especially in an invasion, Solen. You should know better!\" Brennan himself hefted a gun that may have been either a big machine gun or a small missile launcher, either way, it looked like it meant business. \"Them Antis have been knockin' on the door all day. I saved Daimon's water pistol so he might demonstrate how to use it.\" Daimon liked nothing more than to show off, and he perked up at the shot of some fireworks for the hospital denziens. But one thing stuck in his mind.<br>\r\n     \"What do you mean invasion? Who's gonna invade this cess-pit?\" Daimon said, confused. Brennan's cheerful face fell. \"Come with me and I'll show you.\" They walked in silence up to the roof, where Brennan handed Daimon the laser. \"Keep your head down, but look out,\" he warned. Daimon needed no words of caution, because the skyline had kicked him into war-zone mode. Fires raged all over the city, and there were massive buildings with chunks blasted out of them. From all directions there were sporadic bursts if gunfire, and eerie howls. There was nothing instantly visible outside the hospital, but when Brennan approached the ledge, a flurry of activity signaled not all was as it seemed. Off in the distance, the clatter of helicopter rotors was heard, and Daimon could just see them circling one of the city's large towers. But now, on the streets below a menagerie of hellish beings had emerged from the shadows. Some had wicked claws, some were just plain big, and some had some kind of apparatus that looked like a rudimentary rifle. One among the stood out, as he was taller than most of them and he held an oversized hammer. It looked at Brennan and said \"Have you considered our terms?\" in a raspy voice that dripped with evil.<br>\r\n     \"Freak shut your goddamn mouth! You're talking to the 26th Typhan infantry. We ain't never surrendered, and we sure as Goras aren't going to start now, to some kind of demon hellspawn!\" Brennan hollered, using the language he used on rowdy sports opponents. The demon hissed, and spoke again. \"We will only take half of your hospital patients as food-sacrifices. The rest of you are free to go where you wish. For the time being of course. We know you've held out this long, but soon you'll be out of your 'bullets'. Then what shall you do?\" This didn't stop Brennan for a second. \"When we're outta bullets, if your still around I'll personally walk out these doors with an axe and cut you to pieces. But I've got a buddy who incinerated your big baddy, and he's got a new toy to show y'all! Daimon, you care to take over?\"<br>\r\n     Daimon emerged from cover and brandished his weapon. The demon looked scornfully at this new gun. \"Your science is so ineffective. Magic is the way to go my friends, but soon you'll all see. This planet shall be ours. And to show you the hopelessness of your situation, I shall allow you one free shot,\" the demon bowed and grinned. He vanished, leaving all his slavering hordes at the mercy of Daimon. Switching some dials on the gun, he aimed at the largest group of the demons. Squeezing the trigger, a broad blast of energy poured from the barrel, completely engulfing the hell-spawn. A pall of black smoke rose from the spot where the Antis had stood. The survivors, the ones outside the blast radius, looked at the boiled stonework with unease. No trace remained of the behemoths and othe creatures that had occupied the space before. The leader reappeared, and seemed angry. He ordered the hordes to</span></div></div>",

You were returning from a simple errand of grabbing some groceries from a small store for something to make for dinner tonight, lightly swinging the plastic, crinkling bag with the motion of your steps. Making your own food and meals was your priority now, especially since you were attending a boarding school that you lived at amongst the boy's dorms. Your mother had died from childbirth, <i>your</i> childbirth, with your father having left the home one day to abandon you and your older sister for the rest of yours and his life. It wasn't at all bad though, since you kind of preferred it to be that way. Your older sister always treated you very motherly-like and helped to take care of you. However, the time came to where she had a job opportunity in a different city, but you were still in boarding school, and she would feel guilty to leave you alone. You coaxed your sister into taking the job anyways, because you were fine on your own. You could always take of yourself for the time being since you were getting close to finishing school and you had a job as a photographer's assistant, so it wasn't at all a bad job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way through the several alleys and paths towards your dorm, you heard a sudden slop-like noise shift around you. You glance to your left into a pitch black alley, and with night time setting and lack of lights, it was hard to see what was between and down the brick walled buildings. Whatever it was, the sound was gurgling and sloppy, with the occasional ripping sound. You wondered if some kind of animal had gotten into something, and with your cruel curiosity, you step closer towards the noise with your phone pulled out. Using the light of your smartphone, it produces a decent amount of light forward that you could make your way through the darkness. The sounds became more apparent the closer you ventured forward, until finally after turning the corner, you gasp as you drop your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had become completely shocked as you saw a body of a man laid out on the concrete, motionless. With your phone on the ground, the light was still aimed towards the body on the ground with you just as frozen still as it was. Pondering if he was simply unconscious or dead, blood stains painted around his clothes with crimson smears all along the ground. You take several steps forward, just to see what had happened to him until another ripping and gross sound emitted out. Out from behind the body, black goo rose from out of the darkness with an glowing red opening that looked like a mouth with blood oozing directly out of it. This gelatinous creature was actually <i>eating</i> the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give up on moving forward and take some steps back before hearing another sloshing noise behind you. More black goo was sliding down the walls to splat down wetly to ambush you between the two creatures. Your heart began to race at this point and you glance around as the two blobs begin sliding closer and closer to you from each end. If you didn't act fast, you might just end up like that dead body. With the two creatures' rate of movement, calling out for someone to save you wouldn't do you any good, and you look around for a weapon. By a dumpster you see a loose and rusty pipe rest against a wall, and with making time to get to it, you grab your hands around the blunt weapon to tug at it, trying to break it off from where it was stuck against the crumbling bricks. It would fidget around, yet it wouldn't just slide out for your sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Anti launches its blobby texture at you with an open maw as you yank heavily at the pipe.</span></div></div>",

It yelps garbledly and splats against the ground, bubbling some. You didn't waste another moment and desperately swing the pipe down to smash against the blob creature repeatedly that after you finish beating it down, it was an unrecognizable large black smear along the ground with puddles and bubbles sizzling into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a huge weight drop down against you, as another Anti blob had drooped down a wall to fall on top of you. You gasp and grunt in terror as you try to roll and get that thick slime of of you as it opens its mouth. You're able to cram the pipe in their to stop it from biting down at your head to struggle around with it. At last, you roll again to have the monster slide off of you for you to smack it's thick form away into a wall. It shrivels and scaredly slides away in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves only one more Anti to deal with, and you grip your trusty pipe in both hands as you look over to where you saw it last. Although, your hands shake as you see that the blob that had once been eating the nameless man's corpse was absorbing around the body! You could see the dead man's skin and hair turn black with the ripped openings turning into a glowing red just like the creature, and to your horror, it begins to twitch out some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that it leg to press at the ground, with its other one soon following. The body then inevitably stands up with a wet gurgling sounding out from its punctured throat. The Anti is now in a humanoid look, with legs and clawed arms that fit a silhouette of the dead corpse it consumed around. It eyes and mouth are a deep void of red, along with any of the bite marks and opening around its figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the bat for a prepared swing, you begin to feel sweat drip from your head as the creature growls hungrily at you. More of the black goo drools from its maw as some of it bleeds out from the body's injuries.</span></div></div>",

A loud and metallic sound rings out once you make contact with its head, giving you some confidence as the Anti sputters out in pain and staggers to the side against a brick wall to the alley. Having it stunned while holding its head, you swing the weapon around to slam the head back into the wall, smashing the black slime to burst out for the body then fall to the floor, writhing a bit some before becoming perfectly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistraught after actually killing the creature, you fall onto your rear, desperately kicking at the ground to crawl away from the body as it begins to boil back into a black blob before sizzling completely away. Heaving air and slowly getting back up, there was a cruel sickness seemingly boiling in your stomach as you feel like throwing up after the whole experience. Without wasting another moment, you stumble out of the dark alley and back onto the streets to go for help. You need the police, or just anyone for that matter. Your clothes had been soaked in the black oily substance of those blobs, and there was someone who was killed, possessed, and dissolved away after you killed it. You almost felt bad for smashing its head open, but you were sure that it would try to make a meal out of you as well as it did for whoever that poor victim was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWobbly but surely making it there, you are brought to a terrible realization of an army of people scattering through the lanes of cars amongst the city streets, all running in the same direction with screams and car-wrecks bellowing out around. Fearfully glancing to your right, you see that you weren't the only one attacked recently. A horde of those black creatures were ravaging the city, chasing down people to devour them or turn them into one of the monsters. The fear erupting inside your heart almost has your hold on the pipe drop. You need to get of here. <i>Now</i>. You were no hero, and this was a terrible epidemic that the military had to solve. You had questions of what these demons are and where they came from, but your main priority was to escape just like everyone else.</span></div></div>",

At least, if you even made it that far alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench the rusty pipe in your hands, muttering to yourself as you begin to run in the streets with the other citizens, \"I just need to get home. As soon as I'm home, I can stick there while the police and military have this whole thing blown over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way through the high trafficked area of the road, several cars smashed into one another amidst the chaos, along with other cars completely abandoned once they were boxed in together. It was hard to traverse your way between the vehicles on the street with only a few narrow passages available to squeeze through, making some of those black blob demons catch up to other runners of the city. You see a man close by you get pounced down one of the black blobs as he screams and wails through the murk. You were about to head over to whack the thing off, but you quickly see it engulfing him, literally fusing itself to his flesh to make his entire turn black and his eyes glow red. He literally transformed into one of the monsters before your very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your back to him, feeling like there was nothing you could do for the guy. You walk over some of the cars blocking your way, hearing more of the recently transformed people giving chase and attacking other people just trying to get away. You had no clue what was going on or why it was happening, but you turn the corner to the street where your boarding school was. However, you skid to a complete halt and duck against a car to peer over to spot several of those blob creatures sliding around the cars piled around the street, sliding throughout the maze of vehicles and debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, these things are everywhere...\" You hiss to yourself, trying to look for another way around. You still had your pipe at hand, and could probably take them out head on just like you did in the alleyway, or you could try to find some other way around and try to outrun the things.

Waiting for one of the blob creatures to slither past the opening in its hunting patrol, you sneak around the car with the pipe wound around in your hands just to be prepared to swing if you're caught and thankfully you're unseen once you shimmy through the two cars. You run towards the fence, throwing the pipe over first before scaling the fence and making your way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it through the parking lot and up the staircase of the dormitory without any trouble or monsters in sight. At the balcony making your way to where your room was located, you glance back towards the city where nothing but the low roar of people and police sirens filled the night air. And yet with all of the chaos and destruction happening, it was mostly quiet where you were standing, meaning that probably no Anti where around to attack anyone. The school was closed for the Sunday so no one should've been inside, and you quickly go inside to your place. Locking the door behind you and pushing a bookshelf against the doorway so nothing would get inside, you head over to a desk with a phone on it and immediately try calling your older sister. You get ready to speak, but the phone line was completely dead silent however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Just...perfect.\" You mumble to yourself, dropping the corded phone and slumping down on a couch. There, you just sit in the dark room quietly to yourself as you were forced to listen to the ambiance of the Anti attacking the heart of the city. If you turned on the lights, it would probably only draw the attention of those monsters outside. You felt scared, but a little underwhelmed as well. What else was there that you could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you heard steps running about upstairs in the ceiling right above you, along with some yelling. Apparently one of the boys upstairs had discovered the recent epidemic occurring now. Although, a loud crash suddenly sounds out as black figures rush past your window to the outside balcony and apparently infiltrate the neighbors' room. You hear them yell as well, only making you stand up with your pipe to just listen to the havoc around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If I stay quiet enough...maybe they won't come in here...\" You think to yourself in your head. That hopeful idea would end however as your window suddenly bursts open with one of the black creatures leaping in through it. You fall to your rear by the surprise, kicking back at the ground to make some distance as you try to make out its figure in the dark room. This black creature was different from the ones you had seen. It was completely on all fours, with sharp claws, a bladed tail, and more of a solid look to it. It had the anatomy of a wolf, but the look and sounds of a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts glowing crimson eyes quickly see you as the predator begins to make its way closer to you, licking its chops and revealing blood-soaked fangs. You gulp and ready your pipe as you give it a swing once the creature pounces out towards you with claws extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, a gunshot flashes in the room and the head of the black creature in front of you erupts in an oily explosion. The black fluid splatters a bit on your clothes as the Anti's body falls forward and slumps down right beside you. You pant as you freak out a bit, crawling up against the wall as you just stare at the black slime creature's body beginning to melt down into a molten substance on the floor until footsteps sound out within the room that force you to glance towards your apparent savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay kid?\" A male voice of a grown man says as you see the figure in front of you turns a flashlight on to see your face. The light blinds you a bit at first, making it harder to see. But from what you could tell, you see a bit of a masculine figure in what appears to be military gear and smoking gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank God...the military...Y-Yeah, yeah I think so.\" You shudder as you struggle to stand. You see the silhouetted man offering you a hand to aid you back to stand, and you gladly take the help. When finally up on your two legs, you look up to see not the face of man...or rather...a human for that matter, but the face of a deer! The buck had antlers coming out from his head and a humanoid figure wearing black leather armor with white letters inked on the backside and upper right chest corner, 'IDP'. His legs end in hooves and you also notice the hand that helped you up strangely had thin fur on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately let go and stumble back up against the wall. \"A-Ahhh! What the fuck!\" You exclaim, tensing up and holding your pipe tight. Going for a swing, the anthro deer yipes as he takes a step back for your weapon to miss before gritting his teeth and growling. His hand immediately seizes your metal tool and throws it out from your hands and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh! You stupid kid, I'm trying to help you! Just calm down before anymore Anti hear you.\" The buck grunts as he glances back at the open window to check on any intruders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to catch your breath, unable to peel your eyes off of this...animal man in your home. \"...You're...a deer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm aware.\" He retorts, keeping his attention around the surroundings of the dorm room. \"But I might be a dead deer unless you keep your voice down. Beast Anti typically work in packs, so more might be coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that word again. <i>Anti</i>. Not only that, but he called it a Beast Anti. You muster through the awkwardness of the situation to say, \"Why...are you a deer? What's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are immediately silenced once he cups a hand over your mouth with his other hand pointing a finger directly at you for the anthro buck to stress his words. \"Listen kid. It doesn't matter what I am, because I'm here to try and save you. If it helps to cram anything into that small human skull of yours, I work for organization that kills the things that try and attack you. Just think of me as...something from a different world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like an alien?\" You mumble through the muffling hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. An alien. Now stay quiet, stop freaking out, and stick close to me. We have a van outside that I can take you too so we can take you somewhere safer, but my job right now is to make sure this entire building is clean of those black slime freaks we call Anti. Got it?\" He demands for a response with a bit of an angry scowl. He wasn't the type of savior you wanted, but it was at least something. You nod and he releases the hand cupped around your mouth. \"Good. Now where's your family. I can take them as well, but we don't have a lot of room in the armored van, and we won't make two trips just to get other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live here alone. Did those black things...Anti were they? Did those Anti come from another...world as well?\" You ask, looking at the bubbling mass that was once the Beast Anti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. They come in all shapes and sizes, and all they care about is killing you, consuming you to get bigger, or even making you into one of them. If you're the only one here, then we're wasting time keeping you in this room still. Head outside to the van labeled IDP. You'll get more answers when I get back in there, but you need to go. <i>Now</i>.\" He says pushing your back and leading you to the broken window to climb through in since the bookcase still blocked your door to outside. You shudder with the thought if one of those monsters had actually gotten to you, and you were still hesitant and trusting this apparently other-worlded deer man, but you had little options right now. Being safe in a military van with soldier wanting to help you felt like the best choice right now. It still bewilders you that these other races and monsters were showing up just now, as if you were going on some kind of LSD trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just before you arrive at the window, a wet splat sounds out from behind you two. You both twist around to see some of the regular black blobs sliding down through the cracks of the walls and from the vents to approach you two, making you tense up. The deer however seems really cocky, pulling out his pistol and chuckling, \"Heh, don't worry kid. These are what we call Sludge Anti. They're the lowest of the low when it comes to these slimy scum monsters. Let me handle this. As I said before, head to van while I draw them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere and then, he begins firing casually, shooting away at each of the blobs for his bullets to rip right through them and seemingly disintegrating them as they bubble away into thin air. You however notice that the body of the Beast Anti that had been killed was dissolved into a fairly large pile of Anti slime, forming back into a Sludge type and slithering over towards the deer without his knowing. You spot your pipe on the ground close to you that he had thrown away earlier, and you need to act fast.</span></div></div>",

You fall into the mass of thick slime as it begins to wrap around you to envelop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick and scream some, having your struggling aimlessly failing you until you call for help from the deer again.

You face a similar situation as the slime envelops your head and body, sinking you within the gooey tar to force your lungs into passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo close to safety, you and the deer face immediate defeat from your clumsiness and become nothing more but just more victims to the Anti.</span></div></div>",

But without another thought to go by, the Anti creature suddenly breaks out of its slow movement to roar and pounce out with you. Left hesitated and defenseless by your thoughts, you find yourself being tackled to the ground by the black zombie creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell out some as the Anti seemingly snickers at capturing and pinning you down, almost as if the creature was enjoying your struggles. Your trusty pipe had fallen and skidded away from the tackling impact, destroying your hope of being able to stop this monster as the weapon lays just beyond your reach. Thinking about calling for help, you hear other screams far off as well, and by looking to your side to see out of the alleyway to the streets, you see several people running away as more black creatures chase them down. It appeared that no one was going to save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that note, your try to kick the Anti off of you while pushing your hands at its chest, but its own clawed hands found themselves to tightly hold your wrists down, rendering your arms useless at this point. You suddenly see the silhouetted creature open its mouth, revealing the sharp and still black teeth inside before it chomps down on your shoulder. Yelling out, the Anti licks over at your wounds as its black slimes oozes into the bite mark. Pressing your legs at its stomach, you manage to toss him of you with a mighty kick and roll back up to an upright stand. Grabbing the pipe again, you try to ignore the pain in your shoulder to be ready to attack the zombie-like demon. However, before you could go in for another attack, your vision was beginning to lose its focus and grow more foggy and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shaking hands lose the grip on the pipe you tried so hard to get again as you fall to your knees. You glance at your bite from the creature to see that the black Anti venom was now in your blood stream, turning your flesh into the same form of black goop just like that other monster. With you mind blacking out, you fall to the floor with the Anti zombie cackling happily as your body forms into a zombie silhouette Anti as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of transformation, all that used to be you was gone now. Your memories, your body, and mind had all vanished now. As an Anti, you growl hungrily and stumble out to find humans to prey on as an Anti horde attacks the city.</span></div></div>",

Ah, enough of my cynical thinking, i'm at the Outpost. I'm sure I can describe it for you since you're not IDP nor in my dimension, the Outpost is located at the top floor of a rather ravish looking twelve story building. All the businesses located below are owned by the Black Horizon hunting corporation, which isn't exactly a legitimate corporation persay, more like a criminal enterprise that was built on Anthro hunting. Once you enter through the large revolving doors you'll see a woman who looks like a secretary who will ask what floor you have business with, if you say any other one then the 13th then she'll pull out a silenced desert eagle and promptly shoot you in the head. Her name is Elizabeth and she's an excellent shot, trust me i've seen. <br>\r\nNow i've got two choices to go about this business, I can chat up Elizabeth to see what companies are offering the most on Anti heads or I can take the elevator upstairs and see what firepower they've got to offer first.

You didn't know that it was a woman due to her face being masked by a tinted helmet until you heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new member? More like a new <i>replacement</i>.\" Her voice was cold and stern. Her head didn't even turn to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a...replacement?\" You asked while looking up at Officer Kent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, she's just saying that because...\" His words trailed off as he began to look more worried. \"Listen, I've been looking for new members for awhile. It's just...we so happened to have lost one of our members recently on a mission.\" He flipped his look back to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Alice Foster. She's our skilled sniper of the group.\" He notes. \"Alice, would you kindly greet Melanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice flipped her coin a few times on her thumb before stopping. She placed it on the end table and pressed her hands on the side of her helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong dark golden blonde flowed out once she removed it. She faced her head to look you in the eyes. Her hazel glare browsed over stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me how old you are.\" She wasn't asking. It was a <i>command</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nineteen.\" You replied. You used a prime tone, cultivating yourself in a dominant embodiment. Shock took on Alice's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kent, does the Commander enjoy constantly screwing us?\" Alice asked in complete rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Melanie's record? Even you would be impressed, especially for her age.\" Kent added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Alright Melanie, how much experience have you had in the field?\" You tensed up from Alice's question. To be honest, you haven't had any missions before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done the initiation training.\" You answer back. Alice had heard enough, putting her helmet back on, grabbing her coin, and her rifle, she left the room in a stressful manner. You feel a bit of hatred to her but Kent pats you on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind her, she's usually the happiest one out of the entire team.\" He says. \"Anyway, Since for some reason that Alice was the only one here, you can meet the rest of the team tomorrow. I want you well rested for tomorrow in case we do have a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then points down the hall to a door of what you guess to be your room. You carry your bag and watch Kent leave by the elevator also adding, \"When you wake up, meet us back here inside this room.\" And with a wave goodbye, the elevator doors closed, and he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter your average looking bedroom and immediately slump onto the bed. You had an entire stress filled day from just wondering if you'll enter the IDP. To your relief, you succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could think about was resting your tired eyes, until you hear a knock at your door. You sit back up and tiredly say through a yawn, \"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly see...</span></div></div>",

To your bewilderment, he was wearing more casual clothing; White under t-shirt, with an IDP dark gray jacket over it, and black pants that were specifically made for his distinct fox-like legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...our new member...?\" He presumes to be you. You find yourself at a quick loss of words. You've heard of anthros and how some of them worked for IDP, but never have you actually been face to face with one. You reveal your hand for greeting shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm Melanie. And you are...?\" You timidly ask. He not only shakes your hand but practically embraces it. He claps both of his hands on your single hand and shakes vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's about time I get to meet you! I'm Varen, the team's tech support. I was with Kent in deciding for you to be on our squad after researching potential members.\" His smile was warm as he stretched it across his long mouth as he sat down on the edge of the bed with you. You definitely liked Varen as a team member much more than Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Varen. I met Alice a minute ago. She was...not what I expected.\" You acknowledged mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes, you came at an ironically bad time for a first impression from Alice.

I'm sorry...\" You assured him with your worried tone. He smiles back at you surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. He technically sacrificed himself for the team.\" With a yawn, Varen got back up and drowsily commented, \"Well, it's late and I would rather talk about this topic another time. I'll see you in the morning in the briefing room, and, oh, good luck tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved bye as he exited the room.

Turning, you notice most of his physical attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a quite a large man, but not in an obese way. His body was profoundly packed with muscle, that it even shown through his armor padding! He was a bald African-American IDP officer, with deep brown eyes, with black trimmed facial hair at his jaw line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single white cigarette was jabbed in between his lips, while his hand pulled out a silver lighter, clicking the flame to ignite. Raising the lighter, he burned the tip of the cigarette and puffed a small amount of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such an intimidating appearance, your already inhibited body relaxed from his kind smile. His white glared their purity out with his bashful open smirk when he noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the cigarette out from his mouth with one hand, he walked over to you, and raised his arm for a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evan Miller, the pyrotechnic. You must be Melanie.\" His deep yet happy voice calmed some of your nerves about him. He seemed to you, to be around Kent's age for his stature and tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Kent mocked him without looking at him. \"More like our <i>pyromaniac</i>.\" Evan shrugged the joke away and released your hand from the shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the pyrotechnic. I'm guessing that means you're good with explosives..?\" You suggested. He snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guessed right. I know just about everything dealing explosive or flammable armament and ammunition. Dangerous, risky, expensive, but a little entertaining in a way.\" He answered back. Ironically you noticed the multiple belts he wore, with some even containing grenades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door to the room opened, and Varen walked out, energetic and blithe as he was last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to rest your still tired frame by plopping back onto a chair, greeting Varen. \"Good morning Varen. Did you just wake up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaren responded by saying, \"Nope! I've actually been awake for most of night.\" He chuckles to himself while leaning against the table. Evan Miller went back to looking out the window, continuing to smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Don't smoke kids. Honestly, it's bad.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan inquired, \"So Vary, how much sleep did you get this time?\" He left a small smoke trail exhaust out when asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two entire hours! A new personal record for me.\" Varen said happily, twitching his short whiskers. This, of course, shocked you! Two hours only, and this was the best sleep he's ever had...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insomniac or something Varen?\" You determinedly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Um...I wouldn't exactly be surprised if I was or not, but I don't need much sleep anyway. I work so much during the nights to the point that I don't have much time for rest.\" He explained to you. Well, he was the technical support for the group, so he must work for large amounts time and effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the tech support, so you must deal with the tactics of missions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" Kent hops in your conversation with a concerned expression. Varen, however, was excited by the inference. His ears even perked up as his smile grew bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not just do the tactics, but I can also plan our attacks, escapes, provide statistics, hack into hardware, pilot vehicles, fight Antis if need and if I do say myself, I believe that my aim is vastly sharp, and I can command the team from another position, monitor the squad, request fro-\" Varen was cut off by Kent reassuring,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she gets the idea, Varen.

Everyone stopped talking during her entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning boys and girl. The Commander has yet again <i>amazed</i> me in his ironic decisions for me as he asked to see meet up in his office. We get another job to do.\" She said in a sarcastic joyful tone. She continued her way to the briefing table, sliding a card into an opening. Kent sat up while Evan and Varen put their undivided attention to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger closer as you watch of what seems to be a glowing projection appear on the table,  revealing a map of Gate City, titling every road and building within its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice scrolled through the map until stopping it to one position. She pointed directly to it while explaining, \"This is where we'll be dropped off, past this highway and into the west outskirts to the city to clear out an Anti hive. That part of the city is still under construction, so we'll probably get lucky on having no accidental pedestrians waltzing around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, I'm supposing the Commander told you this personally before me?\" Kent guessed. She winked at him and replied, \"You read my mind, Officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent nodded and left the table, \"Grab your gear from the armory and meet me back at the docking station in three minutes. Varen, you're flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Officer Kent leave into another room, you follow the others into the elevator, traveling with them to the armory. Your first mission on your second day. The commander must be pulling your leg or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile going down, Alice made eye contact with you. \"I don't think we <i>properly</i> introduced each other.\" She stuck a hand out to you surprisingly. Stunned, you briskly grasp it for a shake as she continues, \"Alice Foster, tactical sniper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStammering for words you say, \"Melanie Claire, ordinance specialist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're good with any kind of weapon, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most of them actually.\" Alice was still curious of you, including Evan and Varen who were waiting in the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me Melanie, if you don't mind me asking, but how exactly does a young girl like you acquire such good skills and join a force such as the IDP?\" You took a minute to think about her question, but finally answered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My older brother joined the IDP.\" Finally, Alice stopped her questions and watched the elevator ring its bell and slide open the doors. Her smile never left her face from the moment she walked into the briefing room and exiting the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at everyone piling out and heading to their specific weapon access you are left with deciding which set of artillery you should set up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This decides what you will use for most of this story.

I don't even see security walking around, or anyone for that matter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent sighed and turned to face the both of you. \"That means we'll have to search the inside of every building in here.

VORE CHAPTER!)</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your gloved fingers grip the knife tightly into your hands to the point where you could even hear the slight grinding rubber of the handle shudder in your clutch. You bolt towards the gooey black creature with the blade in hand, hoping to rush in for a quick kill like your training had done for you. The Anti slime creature still hadn't fully formed yet, forcing it to lie in a single position of its blob spot to change for an easy target. Knowing it couldn't avoid your attack, your dash quickly paces ever so closely to the premature demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jab your knife into its chest, listening to the wet <i>shhnk</i> of its wound spurt out black Anti liquid. You check on the blade mark, only to find the attempt to kill the anti hadn't gone according to plan. Being in its slimy substance, the knife merely sat inside the jelly-like hide of the creature to do no damage. The Anti glares at your with demonic glowing red eyes as a clawed hand grips your neck, tightening while lifting you up a bit. You choke and kick your legs helplessly in the air, gagging softly at your clenched throat. To your horror, you watch the Anti slide the blade out of its torso, tossing the weapon away like a mere toothpick to skid to off along with your rifle. You gulp in terror to the best of your abilities as the Anti licks its sharp-looking maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the cavernous glowing maw charge forward, feeling its teeth sink into your helmet. You wince and brace for the pain of having your head being decapitated, but your surprised to feel the creature to just remove the helmet from you and spits it out. Knowing that you're confused, the Anti quickly roars and plucks your head into its drooling maw. Having transparent black liquid for saliva, the slick gunk slather your entire exposed head as the Anti's hands pin your arms to your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou angrily grunt and writhe within the creatures grasp, frustrated and bewildered at what was happening. \"Is thing thing....eating me?\" You ask yourself in your thoughts. You're answered by a fat tongue being dragged over your face, glossing it in drool. You spit out the fluid as the inner cheek walls pull you in deeper, squishing your shoulders into its squelching maw. The tongue basks over your abdomen, however the Anti grunts at the leather-like padding of your IDP gear suit over you. Apparently, it hated the flavor of clothes. Good taste or not, the slimy beast pursued its binge, scarfing down your legs to slide in until the bottom of your boots were trapped inside its mouth. Your entire body feels like being inside a tight, slimy, fleshy tunnel that throbs at your filling while you can only wriggle like prey. Your whimpers and sobs ripple through the Anti's jelly-like innards, only coming out as quiet muffled sounds bumping inside the wobbling bulges going from the Anti's neck down to its stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the stomach, your head enters the a suddenly open space, though very little room is left inside. Your struggling body sinks inside the dark chamber, eventually curling inside as the space stretches to fit your new presence. You panic and press your hands and legs at the slimy grayish walls, pressing out to see if you could escape. Nothing tears or gives out, and the act only tires your body faster. Your wet hair slops over your face as your shivering slick body trembles under the heat of the creature's body. \"I can't be some alien's meal! There's just...no way...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach walls suddenly converse on you, squishing you into an immobilized state as black goo began to spurt inside. It was the creatures stomach acids. You wriggle a bit longer only to tire out quickly. you feel no pain as the thick tingling substance seem to bubble around your body. You could even feel the Anti's hands rubbing the fat lump you made in its body once your eyes begin to flutter. Moaning in weakness, you pass out inside the pool of goo that had only risen to your chest, fainting into a deeper darkness as the rest of the Anti horde would also attack and devour your squad mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anti swallowed the girl's legs inside, feeling and listening to her struggle as she filled its gut. It slapped its slimy hands over its completely round belly, pressing and squeezing it to toy with its weak prey. Licking its lips, the girl's whines and movements slowed down to a stop as a loud gurgle sounded from the creature's stomach. The Anti flashed a demonic smile as it rubbed its digesting gut. Sloshing the fat belly only a tad longer, it plopped back onto all fours, stepping out to an open window to climb out. It certainly would not exit the building normally due to the fact of an IDP team searching for their lost teammate, yet it had trouble to roam out. Its large belly got stuck within the small window frame, jiggling at the pressure of the tightness, The Anti grunts and manages to plop the entire heavy weight out so it could climb along the wall and lay atop a rooftop, safe from harm. Its hands went directly back onto its hammocking gut, endeavoring to calm the loud gurgles of the easy caught snack to froth inside. The Anti purrs as it could hear the sounds of the other IDP agents yelling with loud lip smacks and gulps of other fellow Anti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling a hiss, the Anti rested back, relaxing as the planet's population will fall prey to the creatures, just like the girl had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><div align=\"center\">[ <span class=\"clred\">MISSION FAILURE</span> ]</div></b></font></span></div></div>",

It bites down at your head, as you somehow managed to dodge the ferocious fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts oily hands pin down your shoulders, and placing the hind legs by your side. It chomps again, digging the sharp fangs into the sides of your helmet. It throws it off with its mouth, gagging at the metal taste. Luckily you suffered from no damage, thanks for the protection of your thrown away head gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour struggles barely even put up a fight to the Anti, as it looks back down at your straining face with it's glowing crimson eyes to attempt to bite down again.

You see out of the corner of your eye, your knife just inches away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch your arm as far as you physically can, feeling every tendon bending at the length.

Varen can't possibly take all of these by himself.</i> You thought to yourself. Suddenly, one of the beasts tackles Varen, pushing the fox to the ground and onto the staircase. You attempt to help him throw it off, but the other Antis prevent you by blocking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot one of them, as the bullets spew more dark liquid from the wounds, as another approaches you, ready to stab your chest. You melee your elbow to its head, sending it to hit the floor and hold its skull. The last one however unsheathes long black blades from within its arms, swiping at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up your rifle to act as a shield, while sparks burst from each impact of its strikes. Meanwhile, Varen rolls down the staircase with the attacking Anti. Both are struggling to push each other off, until Varen makes a feral growl, biting deep into the neck of the Anti. Howling, the dark creature finally releases Varen in pain, as Varen quickly hops back up and wipes the black liquid from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, continue your brawl against the bladed Anti. You kick its chest, barely doing much to it, during the process of another stab attempt.

There was an engraved teeth row mark pierced inside the headgear, but at least it was still usable and intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing it on, Varen scopes the staircase and advances downward. Following the tense fox, both of you manage to arrive at a door and position yourselves at each side of the concealed opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he's in there?\" Varen idiotically asks you, placing an ear on the metal door. A bullet pierces through the door, whizzing past the very tip of the anthro's nose and almost scratching it. You look directly at the mortified fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Opening the door, Kent pushes through the opening with an Anti being thrown off of him. The dark creature falls down in front of him, as Kent staggers around to be able to stand.

The both of you wince from the sound and look back at the room Kent had recently ran out off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Anti liquid was splattered all across the floor and ceiling, while some bodies began to deteriorate into the air, practically vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, Kent, how many Antis were in there?\" Varen said with his heart skipping a beat from the sight. Kent placed the pistols from his hands back into their holsters as he brushed the black liquid off from himself, breathing in heavy beats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I lost count after I killed about seven. *Whew* What about you?\" Kent crossed his arms and leaned in on one side. Varen began counting on his hands, occasionally mumbling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here.

You were shocked though. These men were laughing after a near death experience about how many living things they had just killed. Were they stupid? You guessed that the attitude and response came with the job later in time for IDP members. Maybe this was how the male mind really functioned, and women were different in their own independent way of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This will probably be a one-chance-only though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He tosses it once more in his hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow good is your throwing arm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He slashed any root or tentacle that came across his way, until he was soon approaching the core body of the Anti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestures you to hurry up while trying to defend him, cutting anything in his sight. You begin running after him, finding it difficult to dodge the roots. Pulling your own knife, a tentacle lunges itself your way, as you somehow manage to slice it, cutting the tip off from stabbing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving close to Kent, the Anti attacks him first, wrapping a root to grip his ankles together. As he fell, he stabbed his knife into a core root, slicing all across it in a straight line as he was dragged away from the plant-like torso of the Anti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature roared from the pain, as the long wound began to burst with black liquid like a large fountain, spilling all on Kent. The creature opens the shielding claws from around itself, continuously shrieking. Preparing to unclip the grenade, you see Kent from the corner of your eye struggling against the vines as they pin him a web-like case as a bladed tentacle stretches towards him, about to stab him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re given a brief second on what to do and what to risk.

The tentacle flies straight into your attack, causing it to rip in half and fall to the floor in a wet dark mess.  Kent was surprised by the help, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother complaining about it.

Your body crashes down to the floor, knocking the back of your skull hard against the surface causing you to wince in pain, as a root begins to grow up your body. Your head was dazed from the damage to your head, but you kick out in panic, trying to remove the vine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from your dazed state, you realize another vine has wrapped around your wrist, forcing it to the floor. Using your free hand, you cut the root off only to have another wrap itself around your neck. It forces it down, choking your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sting inside your throat strikes out in agony, as you drop the knife and place both of your hands around the constricting vine to rip it off, not wanting to cut your neck open in the process. The root around your leg, however, managed to climb its way around your legs and torso, pinning you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes squint from the breathless pain, but that only seems to hurt more, as if your eyes wanted to pop out of their sockets. Opening them, you stare face to face to the open-cased head of the Anti, just inches from your face, growling while breathing wretchedly. Its red eyes glare into your dying face, eager to kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if an angel came to save you, you were never so happy or joyful to hear one of the stupidest things that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever heard in your life. It was one of Varen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dry humor jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA helicopter floated next to windowless the room you were in, as Varen spoke through a speaker inside the cockpit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne pyromaniac, coming right up, hot-n\u00e2\u0080\u0099-ready!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan, with an oxygen mask attached to his face, held what seemed to be a flamethrower to you standing at the open side of the helicopter. Evan pressed a handle, releasing a blazing storm of fire into the room. The flames engulfed the Anti, igniting it on fire and spreading across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the intense heat, scorch by you, but Evan made sure not to blast the flames on you. The roots around you curled up and shriveled back in the pain. Releasing your throat, you breathe in oxygen again in safe security, wheezing from the air. The head of the creature screamed a deafening roar, twisting and turning while burning.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe pyro halts his storm of fire \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlice, are you able to shoot the head\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You heard Evan yell over to Alice, sitting next to him while looking down the scope of her rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a clear shot at it.

It was time to act, and after all, it was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature bellowed out once more, while gave a running start and threw your arm forward, releasing the explosive from your hand and out to the Anti. It closes the claws once more, but the grenade manages to be caught inside it before it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few quick seconds of waiting, the inside of the casing grew a bright orange, exploding the entire upper part of the Anti. The liquid flew in all directions, until evaporating into thin air. The roots and remains began to shrivel and disappear away with the liquid, freeing Kent from his pinned state.</span></div></div>",

Looking out of a window, it was nearing nighttime. You wanted to sleep from the long day but for whatever reason you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel tired. (Probably from knowing that you almost died multiple times that day. Probably.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was nothing to really accomplish during the night since you finished unloading your bag. Or was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that someone said that certain fox around here basically never sleeps, so maybe he was up and could at least talk. You still had things to thank Varen for anyway. Walking to the door that you remember that Varen came out of this morning, you give a few soft knocks to it. You hear a muffled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can come in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d from behind the door, so you turn the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door you find Varen, sitting at a desk with a lamp turned on, while writing things down on papers, not only scattered on the desk, but all across the floor, stuck to the walls, and even some that had been taped on the ceiling.

I mean, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you to worry about them or anything.  I was just trying to assure you that I was feeling alright now because-\u00e2\u0080\u009c You held up a hand to stop him from saying too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCool off there. I was just asking about your arm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He remained silent after that for a few seconds before sighing and relaxing his body from a tense state. You decided to change the subject, yet again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, and thanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Varen looked back up, confused on what you were saying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never thanked you for pulling me away from that Anti.

Next time, try not to stand still when being attacked. You might be surprised that it works when it comes to not trying to die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He joked out.

Is that for your 'personal project?\"  You point to the cards in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He replied while placing them in his back pocket.

An anthro reptile strolled past you, reflecting the morning sunlight on his emerald green scales, his orange eyes strike in color, while his padded IDP armor held multiple bladed weapons all across his body. You would say he was a dragon anthro, but he was hornless <i>and</i> wingless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent turned around to look directly at the reptile with a cold face, and anger in his eyes. \"So where exactly have you been, <i>Sern</i>? We had a mission yesterday and yet you were never around. I don't want to hear any lousy excuses this time.\" He crossed his arms as the anthro dragon comfortably sat down in the chair and didn't bother looking at the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Commander ordered me for a small solo mission yesterday. I succeeded and came back here as soon as possible.\" He softly said. No emotion was in his voice, as for his expression was perfectly straight. You couldn't figure this one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why did the Commander not tell me about that directly? You don't need to take me for a complete idiot Sern. Tell me where you were, and I'm not asking, that's an <i>order</i>.\" He stepped right in front Sern, glaring down at him. \"I hope you weren't doing what you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern only blinked in response. \"No sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell me where you were and what you were doing there.\" Kent's glare never left Sern. You were standing at the edge of the room, as you felt like you were an audience, watching a stand-off duel. Everyone felt the awkward chill of silence between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under the Commander's orders, I am not allowed to tell you any information relying on the mission I was on. You should recieve a letter from the Commander himself in your inbox soon.\" Sern then stood up, and walked to a door on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think <i>you're</i> going?\" Kent asked while heturned to Sern. Sern kept his back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room. I haven't slept in over the past two days.\" And with that statement he softly closed the door behind him. Sern's voice sent shivers down your spine. Even if his tone was calm, that voice seemed to pierce right through skin in a sharp manner. Looking back at Varen, he had his hand placed around his mouth, as he tried his best not to laugh. Evan continued to have his back turned the entire time, still smoking, while Alice had her hand resting at her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sern was the only member I never met?\" You asked Kent, who seemed to be on steam in anger. Alice decided that it was best if she was the one to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. He's our expert at close combat and bladed items. He tends to not talk much and avoids other people. I sometimes feel sorry for the guy.\" Kent turned aroundto Alice from her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't feel sorry for him. He's the most inconsiderate coldest member on this team, and I'm still surprised that I let him continue to be on the team.\" He sighed rested bac against the observation table. \"He's not my typical favorite person.\"</span></div></div>",

Just perfect.\" He walked back to Sern's door and loudly gave a few knocks to it. \"Rise and shine, we have another mission, starting now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaren sighed and hopped up from the chair he had been sitting in as everyone walked to the table for briefing. Sern opened the door with his usual blank expression rested in a chair away from everyone standing at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to the new recent orders of the Commander, we get to have a reconnaissance mission. We get to portal-jump to the fantasy realm and locate a specific target.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kent says as he pulls a map onto the table\u00e2\u0080\u0099s screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fantasy realm? Is that truly the actual name for it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You had to ask, and afterwards, Alice answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only been recently discovered and there hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been a scientific term for it, so the members of IDP just nicknamed it the fantasy kingdom. You should be surprised at the fictional comparison it has to some of our human stories. Anyways, Kent, you said we had a target.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kent nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell we had an infected village near this canyon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d He points to the map, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn Anti horde made sure to specifically infect the villagers and not kill them, and the entire encampment lost any sense of control. The residents have become Anti, and that also includes the remaining Anti that was there before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaren interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, are you saying that the entire town is our target? We have to murder all of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kent shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mages there said that they could probably heal the infected townspeople, but they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get there due to one problem. The Anti also had infected a knight there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kent answered, but then Evan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo? There were probably other knights there that were infected. Why does this one have to be any more dangerous than the others?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause this specific knight is different from the rest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kent continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor some odd reason, this one has killed every armed group of military the fantasy realm has sent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more powerful than any other they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pressed a button to reveal a snapshot of the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snapshot showcased a black armored soldier in a dirt road, standing on top of a dead centaur with a large bleeding wound across the horse half\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, and a large spiked dark gray sword was pierced inside of it. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the knight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, for it was concealed by the black helmet, but you were sure that his eyes were glowing red in the open eye-holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis picture was taken by one of our scouts that was in the area. Luckily, he was able to get out of there before any Antis found him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our job to restrain this knight for the mages to get in the village, even if it means killing him. But remember to watch out for the infected villagers. They will try to kill you as much as the Anti will.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And after Kent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warning, everyone headed to the elevator while grabbing their gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern sat up from his chair and grabbed a small bag hanging from the wall by a hook, and went straight to a different floor. You felt the need to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you not coming with us, Sern?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You called out to him from the elevator. He looked at you from the other side of the room, but you thought you could almost see a bit of surprise in his eyes. Could it be from the question, or the fact that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know you and that this was the first time ever seeing you. After all, he never knew the team recruited a new member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking the stairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said and began to descend. Your view of him disappeared when Kent pressed the docking bay level button and the doors closed.</span></div></div>",

Taking off into the air after everyone boarded, you wondered how you could arrive at a different dimension if you were flying in a helicopter. After lift-off, you placed your helmet on, and watched the view from outside. Sern sat across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is the girl sitting in <i>Erica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat</i>?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had asked. Two points of the question slightly scared you. One was that this was the first time he spoke without anyone trying to talk to him or answering a question, and another point was, who was Erica? Alice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is Melanie, our new recruit. Yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission was her first, and she did better than I expected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d One question still remained though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou questioned Sern, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho specifically is Erica?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sern just looks out of the window and says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur recently dead member that you replaced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That was who it was. Nails seemed to start stabbing your back in a creepy chill. You were sitting at a deceased member\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chair, and the word replacement floated in your mind, seemingly to add weight on your shoulders. It was like carrying a body around you. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd she was also Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <i>sister</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last sentence shocked you the most. Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister was the one who passed away? You remember the first night your came to the IDP team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarters, imaging Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first reaction to you. You were going to turn and comfort Alice next you, but she was already speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSern, I usually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind your rude comebacks, but that last bit of knowledge wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t needed for Melanie. And if you mention Erica around me like that again, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think twice before I slit your throat open with your own blades.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her tone was serious, and just by hearing her, you automatically believed that she would actually do it. It was fascinating how she could go from nice to furious so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern just looked back out of the window with his average blank expression. He almost looked, depressed. Luckily, Varen could break the ice, as usual, by saying over the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approaching the portal. I want the seat belts tightened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You could see a strange transparent ripple in the air, and before you could get a closer look, the scenery around you had already changed. The city landscape turned into a forest, with mountains on the horizon. Fields below you looked like a sea of grass as you flew over them, waving from the wind of the copter and thrashing about wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaren landed the air vehicle and unbuckled from his chair. Everyone exited the helicopter and checked their gear, while Kent moved ahead and faced the group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe village is in that direction through that canyon and the helicopter will remain safely here. When we succeed and restrain our target, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll shoot this flare into the air, signaling the mages. I want you, Alice to take Melanie and Sern with you. Maybe you can get along by getting to know each other better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said with a devilish smile and placed his helmet on.</span></div></div>",

Alice, behind you, followed you on the balancing stroll to arrive at the other end of the creek. Sern just walked through the stream, not minding the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surroundings were beautiful to you. The environment was much different from what you were used to. You lived in Gate City for your entire life, not once going anywhere else, so this mission was practically like a vacation to you. The large grass hills, canyon cliffs, bright rough and orange dirt were definitely better than the buildings and constructing world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Alice, do you mind me asking why you went with such a mood change from when we first met to the day after that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You decided to make a conversation if you were going to be traveling for a bit. Varen, Kent, and Evan all went to the lower part of the canyon to separate and get better distance and safety, just in case there was an ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be frankly honest, I hated the fact that you were even hired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGee, thanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You sarcastically replied.

You stopped to face her but she continued to walk past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo then, what made you think you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be cruel to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You asked. It was a dumb question, but you liked knowing details to your answers. She still had her back to you when she answered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because you remind me of her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To you, \u00e2\u0080\u0098her\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was probably her sister Erica. You decided that it was best if you changed the subject before any problems could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started up, but you did feel a bit of flattery of being compared to Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister. Continuing to walk, you turn your head to see Sern, still walking and looking at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow exactly old are you, Sern?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked down at you and replied in his deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwenty-nine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And just like that, the conversation ended and he went back to looking at the scenery. You weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t giving up that easily. You were determined to get the anthro out of his anti-social state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you come to know the IDP, and why would you want to join them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You waited for an answer, but it never came. Sern remained silent, even for the rest of the trek to the village. You looked back at him, and he finally showed emotion on his face, but for some reason, you regret doing it. His face was sad, and he was looking near to the ground now instead of upward. You felt remorse for the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at a small pond with a waterfall pouring into from a small cliff-side, as Alice turned to face the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about two minutes away in walk distance until arriving at the village.

Anti may be nearby if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re this close to the village.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She sat on a log on the shore of the pond and rested her rifle next to her. Sern rested far away under a tree, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at the shore and take off your helmet, placing it at your side. Cupping your hands, you sink them into the water and place the puddle of water to your face, washing it. But you heard an odd noise from the water, with your hands covering your face still. You lower them, searching for the sound when you see a ripple in the water. You look through the murky green water, squinting your eyes to see what was hidden under the foggy color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething arose from the water, revealing a\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

What was odd was that it was reflecting any of the sunlight, even in the water, which meant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react and warn Alice that it was an Anti, you felt a pull on your ankle and you flung into the water! You were sure you could hear Alice yell for your name during the loud crash of the water. The outside world before you turned darker and blurry, and you felt the lungs inside of your own twist and compel within your chest, feeling as if they were about to burst .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour panicking mind kicked in, losing all sense of control. You hated being underwater. You were phobic about the choking feeling under the depth, and your mind would always go blank when it came to a sense of reason and would go haywire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back was being dragged against the muddy floor, with the grip around your leg tight and pulling closer to the other end of the pond. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lower your arms to your legs to pull the Anti hand off from the strong current of water from the force. The withholding Anti was swimming fast and away from your allies on purpose, and you were losing oxygen fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the strain in your neck, pulsating for air, your fearing mind tried to struggle and fight in any way possible, anything to escape the creature.  You suddenly felt a pair of hands grip your shoulders and pull the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface of the water became brighter and much closer, until finally, you felt the welcoming sense of air. Breaking out of the water, you gratefully wheeze in air, coughing out any water from your throat. Looking at upward and letting your eyes adjust to the bright sunlight, you watch as Alice holds one arm wrapped around your side, while the other arm pulls a pistol from a holster. Alice shots multiple rounds into the water, trying to make the shadowy figure underwater repel away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern walks into the pond though, unsheathing a sword from his back. Chopping it down, stabbing the long black limb attached to your leg, freeing you of its grasp.

You immediately crawled back to the coast, coughing more water from your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Alice and Sern were still standing knee deep into the water, and the shadow within the water began to grow in size. The Anti slowly rose up, revealing its full body. The torso had red lines as vents stretched across, occasionally vibrating to what you presumed to be gills. The arms of the creature were incredibly long and sizable claws attached to each end of them. Two antennae stuck out from its head, with gigantic jagged jaws, stretched across the muzzle of the beast. Its eyes flashed a bright red as sharp spines on the back flicked out, releasing a roar to send small waves to ripple out in the water.</span></div></div>",

VORE CHAPTER!)</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Manning up\" and feeling some courage spark into your soul, you grab your gun leaning against the log and dare to take steps back into the pond. The splashes of water terrify you, but you're prepared to aid your friends to kill the Anti forever. You gulp and approach by Alice's side as she aims her handgun directly at the beast. The Anti appeared to be some kind of eel naga with antennas and chest gills, spinning out webbed spikes along its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lake serpent hissed as Alice shot several rounds directly at the creature, occasionally hitting it as it dove back into the water. You cock your rifle and line it towards the diving spot, firing off your own shots as the Anti disappeared within the water once again. You stared at the murky water's surface, discovering that the shadow within the pond to somehow vanish within the cloak of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense. This water isn't that deep, how can it swim underwater and disappear like that?\" Alice asked, frantically scanning the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern surprisingly answered her. \"It's not swimming through the water. It's digging through the muddy surface below this lake.\" His words were specifically warning in a serious manner as a quick rumble trembled through the earth beneath all of you. Suddenly, Alice skyrocketed towards the sky as a massive splash sent you cannoning back underwater once more. You flail about and struggle in the pond water, splashing maniacally to regain your composure. Amazingly enough, you sprout your head out of the water's surface, inhaling an immense amount of oxygen while your eyes strain through the water drops seeping down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart shrinks back a little as you watch the eel Anti tower above, rising above with its long body with Alice struggling in its mouth. From her hips down, her body was between the jagged lips of the creature's mouth, being thoroughly licked around her legs as she cried out in distress. The Anti had burst from underground right under her, snapping her up in its jaws in the process. You cry Alice's name, yet she simply disappears from sight and neatly plops into the Antis mouth. The immense gulping sound echoed in your ears while you were forced to see a wiggling lump slide down the black eel's neck, past its chest, and into its tube-like lower body. Her voice slightly alarmed out in a suppressed ambiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern growled in rage and charged at the colossal naga, holding his sword up to slash an opening for Alice. A black clawed hand quickly snagged the lizard man into its clutches before he could attempt such a flawed plan. You realize within a short moment that the silhouette of a hand reaches out to you, gripping your own body into its fist. You panic and wildly struggle as you're lifted up with Sern in seperate hands to the Anti's drooling maw. Thick strands of slime drip from the creature's glowing red jaws as a loud rumble rippled through its underside. <i>It was still hungry.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to Sern, you cry out, \"S-Sern...We're not gonna end up like Alice are we? Varen and the rest have to come! Use the r-r-radio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clawed digit ripped off the anthro dragon's helmet off, revealing his woeful expression as he stared down. The finger moved downward to tear away the padded armor over his torso, revealing his chest to present itself to the beast. It hissed a noise that could be mistaken for a chuckle as its long whip-like black tongue slathered saliva over Sern, bathing his scaly upper body in its thick spittle. He lightly jerks away from it with shut eyes, but barely struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face it, human brat. We're nothing but eel fat now.\" Sern's last words rang into your ears before you watched half of his body get plunged into the Anti's maw. It sucked against his body and his legs, clawed hindpaws, and tail writhed a tad as the eel's tongue spiraled around him and squeezed his drool coated form. You couldn't avoid staring at the demise of the dragon once his body was gulped inside, sending his body to become a mere stretched bulge sinking down to where Alice was still struggling inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anti belches out to the open air, dabbing its lips to slurp in the rest of the reptile's flavor. You grow pale as the Anti stares at you, slipping out its tongue before it whisks around you, coiling you in its slimy texture to drag you inside its wet mouth. The saliva goo seeps across your body as you kick and flail about, doing nothing against the Anti's might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt licks over your body quite powerfully, but retracts back at the taste of your clothing gear. Seeing that you won't taste as good, the eel's cheek walls hug tightly around you, gulping you down its long esophagus to plunge down into you. Your whimpering body is sent sliding down the Anti's throat, having your surroundings grow dark as the grayish fleshy walls wobble about and drench you in Anti slime. You unhappily shift about your limbs to your gurgling demise until you finally pause in motions within the gooey water slide. Stopping, you peek an eye open to see Sern, growling and fumbling mercilessly in a lying down position just like you and Alice in a chain along the beast's long tubed body. You watch as the slime stringing down off the stomach walls slather and blankets the reptile, deteriorating his armor slowly as it begins to tingle at your own body. Soon, the walls begin to converse over you, and your last memory is seeing Sern's green tail flop within the small vicinity of the Anti's innards before the pudgy tunnel tightens up, smothering your vision to cause you to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anti gulped the third IDP member down, grinning as it felt her body wobble along her entire path down into its belly. Licking its sloppy lips, it slithered onto the shore coast to lay fully down. Rolling onto its back, it gladly watched the three lumps along its tubed body to shake and slosh around, crying out for help that would fall on deaf ears. It loomed its hand over the bulges, feeling the victims writhe within the sticky saliva it had happily covered them in. Coiling up into a spiral, the eel Anti purred an evil tone as it rested its upper body over the quivering lumps of its belly, listening to their pleas before their movements slowed to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased to know that its victims had exhausted themselves and passed out, the Anti quickly fell asleep, eager to digest his meal for the next batch of travelers to scarf down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><div align=\"center\">[ <span class=\"clred\">MISSION FAILURE</span> ]</div></b></font></span></div></div>",

The Anti howls in agony as it swings a long arm over at Alice, swiping her off the underwater ground and back into the water. The arm then swings at Sern, but the reptile impressively dodged it quickly in the heavy water while he slashed his sword out, cutting off a few fingers off the Anti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to crawl to shore, quivering in disgust. Water leaked from your hair and face, including your mouth. Your arms shake as you manage to sit on your shivering hands and knees. The sickness in your stomach begins to press at your throat, inevitably releasing you to hurl out its contents. Oh, how you hated being underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coughing out the last of the vomit, you turned your head to look at the lake behind you, watching Sern fight the Anti single-handed with Alice rising from the water to recover from its attack. She yelled over to you, \"Melanie! Pass me my rifle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to the fallen log she had been sitting at, and there rested her sniper rifle. You attempt to get up, but your legs deny to stand up. Just like in the water, you crawl over to the log as your vision began to go hazy again. Ugh, it hurt to move, and it felt sick to move too. Getting to the log, you reach your hand out to the rifle, to see a someone suddenly stomp on it in front of you; blocking you from taking the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see a girl. But, this girl had a dark body, long black hair and glowing red eyes, just like an Anti! She giggled out, \"Well, well, well...What do we have here? Someone interrupting my father's plans?\" You were taken back. you didn't understand who this was, or what she was talking about, you tried to open your mouth, but no words could come from your weak throat. The girl continued as she looked down upon you, \"I would take care of you right now if I could, but for some reason, my daddy says you are...<i>different</i>. I've been told to study you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudy you? By her father? Who was this man, and who was this girl? Before you could say anything, Alice's voice rang out again, \"Melanie! What are you waiting for? Pass me the rifle!\" You looked at your fellow team member, and back to where the strange girl was standing, but...she was gone! Acting fast, you take the rifle firmly, and with all of your might, you toss it to Alice. Actually being able to catch, Alice flips the rifle into her firing position, pulling the trigger.</span></div></div>",

The Anti roared out and sank underwater, disappearing in the muddy liquid. Alice cocked her gun, as both her and Sern began looking around in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. We're just in knee-deep water. How does a creature so huge hide in such shallow water?\" Alice asked, frantically searching through the murky water. Sern remained silent, until he tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not swimming under the water. It's digging in the ground under the lake!\" He warned, but Alice was suddenly grabbed by a black hand on her leg, and suddenly sank into the muddy ground. Her body stopped digging into the ground at her waist, with her head barely under the surface, slowly drowning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern was suddenly there to aid here, wrapping his arms under Alice's as he pulled her out of the hole. Alice broke through the surface and inhaled a deep amount of air, as water dripped down from her face and hair. The Anti came out of the lake again, still dripping liquid from its left eye. It roars while launching towards Sern, opening its fanged maw. Sern tosses a knife out of a leg holster, and catches it in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing it, it spins through the air, swifting straight into the other eye of the Anti. Black ooze spews out in a large dark fountain, emanating a scream to yell out from the creature. It held its eyes in agonizing horror, being blind and unable to control it self. The Anti flails its long extensive arms out, swiping at Sern and Alice. the green reptile drops Alice clumsily, to pull a sword from his back. As an arm comes launching at him, he briskly stabs it, being carried with the arm during mid-swing. He is thrown into the air a bit above the Anti, until he plummets down, stabbing the Anti in the skull by the blade.</span></div></div>",

You zone out from her conversation and bring your attention to the strange girl you met...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was an...Anti?

Shivers nailed into your spine at the thought of the terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern broke the silence, \"Are you alright...Melanie?\" He continued to wipe his sword and never looked at you when he asked the question, but it was the first time he said your name. He actually showed compassion for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I'm just a little uneasy about being underwater.\" You answered. The conversation for Sern sadly ended, but you did enjoy that he attempted to chat, meaning you were making progress on bonding with the anti-social reptile.

No one walked in the streets or buildings, as doors were boarded up or destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoles and large gaps showcased from the stone and wooden huts, as dust blew across the entire area silently.

One group to start at the east end, and the other at the west end, searching inside the mission by heading to its center until finding the knight. Following Sern and Alice on the east side of the town, you searched through the point of your pistol at the rooftops and alleyways as your team progressed within the empty villa. The sky was fading into a deep bright orange as the sun began to lower in the air. The sun was setting, and you couldn't afford fighting Anti at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a black-like tentacle bursted from a nearby balcony, splitting out in the air as it unfolded into a spike tip at Sern. Out of the corner of his eye, he grasped the tentacle just inches from his face, stopping its force. It tried to retract, but Sern pulled it towards him, throwing an Anti into view. The tentacle had been shot out of the Anti's mouth, using its bladed tongue to kill the anthro reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing pulled into the air, Alice somehow managed to pull her rifle from her back in the blink of an eye, not even needing to use the scope to erupt a bullet directly through the dark creature's skull.

The gunshot inevitably signaled all of the Anti in the village, as you heard deafening roars in all directs blast out in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed eyes appeared in all directions, growing closer to your position from the dark corners of buildings and roofs.

Their screeches echoed out in complete fury as you pulled your rifle from its satchel, fearing the moment of their attack arriving at any second. Sern remained to have his blade out, showing no sign of terror about the oncoming Anti army. Alice cocked her rifle, still gripped in her hands, staring through the scope at the front lines of the Antis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweat bead slowly formed on your forehead, feeling the droplet to streak down the side of your head, plummeting to the dirt road. Hearing the drop hit, you felt your patience run wild. You pulled your gun up, looking down through the sight of it to point at the nearest Anti's head. They were only about three, maybe four meters away, just as you pulled the trigger. The gunshot sounded, and the skull of an Anti flew back, sending a rain of black liquid to spurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Antis pounced, and all of you were ready for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Anti jumped at Sern, unsheathing longs claws to pierce his chest. The reptile unleashed his sword out in front of him, stabbing the body of the creature as it hung down against the blade. Its black blood leaked from its wound, spurting out a wet growl as it grabbed its hands around the sword, weakly attempting to escape. It was on the verge of death, and Sern wasted no time in ripping his blade out from the Anti, killing instantly. This entire process took place in a matter of seconds to your vision, amazed at his quick ability to do all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Alice released your casings of bullets into the black crowd, shooting the surrounding beast wave.

You would wince at the pain from getting an occasional scratch to rake across you, luckily no hitting anything vital. But, after a grueling war between you and the Anti, your team remained to still be victorious in keeping the creatures at bay. Stains of the Anti blood drenched your padded IDP armor in small black splatters. Your limbs were growing weak, but you still managed to be able to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something grabbed your full attention from the corner of your eye.

The pupils of the eyes were barely even visible, and they only reflected a small red highlight to glow out. The knight began to step forward though, slowly taking an armored step towards your group. The black armor reflected no light, tempting fear into you from its large size. Its massive weight intimidated you, striking horror to twist within your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern looked over to you, frozen in fright of the knight. After stabbing yet another Anti, Sern kicked off the body, running for you. You looked back at the floor to see your rifle still laying against the ground when an Anti had tossed it. The knight continued to approach you, not changing its pace of speed. You dive after your weapon, rolling over the ground as your grabbed you gun. You slid to a kneeling shooting position and aimed at the fortified Anti. Pulling the trigger, your gun clicked. The gun needed to reload! Before you could even thinking about changing the clips, A shadow eclipsed over you. The knight stood in front of you, towering over your knelt form, while gripping the handle of the sword attached to its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal of the blade screeched against the tough outer armor, sending a humming sharp noise to ring in your ears as the sword was slowly drawn. You fall to your back, trying to crawl back on the ground by kicking your legs at the dirt.

You didn't know whether or not to thank him or yell at him for hitting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his sword at the knight, but surprisingly, the knight flipped his sword out as if it had no weight, deflecting Sern's blade!

You suddenly heard a growl rumble behind you. An Anti crouched behind you lifted an arm, ready to sling its sharp claws at you. However, small spots began to explode out from it, sending its blood to shoot in the small sudden holes. It fell, dead, as you looked up to see Varen on a rooftop, waving as Kent and Evan appeared behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strand of smoke puffed out from his semi-automatic, as he gave his ridiculous positive smile. You heard him talk on the radio, \"We'll take care of the Anti, Melanie. You can help take care of the knight. Both of us know that you can do it!\" He flipped a thumbs up gesture for good measure. Somehow sparking a smile in you, you stand back up, reloading your gun finally and determined to see this mission through. Maybe it was something in Varen's happy tone of voice that rejuvenated your soul, making any fear fade away. Was it his charisma?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well.You looked back to see Sern, continue his struggle against the knight. Looking down the sights of your rifle, you weren't able to get a clear shot of of the knight without shooting Sern in the process! Grumbling, you stalked closer to the sword battle with Anti around you getting shot from your other team members. Arriving close to the knight, close enough to get a good shot until the knight ducked under one of Sern's stabs, aimed for you. The large massive black sword slung out, slicing close to your head cutting a tiny lock of your brown hair on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern growled while pushing you away, yelling angrily at you, \"Stay back, <i>girl</i>, if you want to keep your life. If you want to help, then stay aw-\" He was cut short when the knight flung his sword at Sern. He was able to twist around it, but the sword sliced his shoulder. He yelped out in the pain, holding his wound as it bled out, pouring a crimson liquid from the injury. You stepped back as Sern began to block the knight's attacks, becoming more offensive then defensive now! The knight slung out with great, weakening Sern at every slash. The reptile was left to hold the sword with only one hand, as his other arm drooped down numbly, stained with small thin strands of blood.</span></div></div>",

However, when the bullets hit, they simply ricocheted off the tough armor, bouncing in other directions. One bullet shot back against the armor and deflected back at Sern. Luckily, the bullet whizzed past him, not directly hitting him but seemed to have scraped the edge of his cheek. He growled again at you, but was too busy to yell at you again from fighting with a sword one handed. Was there anything you could do to help him? You were awful when it came to sword fighting, and bullets wouldn't do anything as long as the knight wore his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like an angel to your day, Alice came down from a balcony, holding her gun the other way by grasping the barrel like a baseball bat. She swung the butt of her rifle at the head of the knight as she came plummeting down, striking the helm of the knight in a loud blood curling denting noise. The metal scarped across the skull of the Anti infected swordsman, cringing the metal on the side of its head. Black blood squirted out from the helm, as the knight made a low groaning noise as Alice landed down, regaining her balance. The knight flailed to kick Alice away, using a large metal boot to kick her into a hut wall, causing her to crash right through it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern backed off as the dazed knight flailed its sword dizzily. It placed a hand on its helmet, ripping it off to reveal the fortified soldier's true face. Shock took you back, as you stared into your enemy's eyes. It was a beautiful elf woman, except due to be being infected, her skin was shaded into a dark grey, glowing blood red eyes, and silver hair to flowed out in the wind, reflecting the sunset light to glow out brightly. The side of her head that Alice hit revealed a black bashed wound, bleeding black Anti liquid. She grunted out and held her sword firmly. She shook the confusion from her mind and charged at you, yelling just like an Anti!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to your side as the hefty sword came clambering towards you, missing you by a matter of millimeters. You felt the wind strike past your face from the sharp swing, almost cutting your face from the air of the impact! She swung angrily again, but this time, you had to cause yourself to fall back to evade this one. The elf woman swung yet again, except more tiredly, slowly, and with more aggressive power. She was losing consciousness from just holding her large sword, so maybe if you just tired her out, maybe you wouldn't have to kill her! The mages could heal her if she fainted! Deciding to stick with this plan, you would have to force yourself to always go near her, dodging her powerful swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dangerous idea, but it would work. However, she pushed her elbow out, knocking you to the dirt road! You shook the dust from your eyes, looking up to watch the elf woman run at you, blade above her head held in both her hands to swing at you. Before you could even blink you noticed Sern pull out a small knife and taking a step back. You reached your hand out, yelling over, \"No! Sern! Wai-\" Your warning couldn't reach him in time, as he stomped forward, throwing the knife at the elf woman while she sprinted towards you. The knife stabbed the side of her neck, knocking her from the force to teeter and fall to her side. Her face went from rage, to blankness, as she fell down near you while a dark liquid spurted from her neck like a small black fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer numb hands dropped the sword, falling and stabbing the ground directly next to you, almost decapitating you! Her body, although, fell to your other side. She tackled against the ground directly next to you, dead. Her head laid on its side, her blank face staring straight into yours. You watch from the floor in horror as a black puddle began to pool out from under her neck.</span></div></div>",

The spark blasted in the air, signalling mages at the town gate the 'okay' to enter the village. You were sitting within a hut, rinsing your face in a bowl of water from the black Anti liquid. Your team had managed to kill the Anti horde, finishing off any  sign of the creature army. You heard the mages come into the town from within the hut you were in, asking about where the infected villagers were. Your squad had locked any remaining or alive villagers corrupted by the Anti virus into a large building, boarded up. Some mages seemed to be draconian beings, others as fawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cupped your hands again together, puddling water together and washing your face. After wiping it away with a towel, you looked up to see the strange Anti-looking girl you saw before! You took a step back, watching the girl as she sat on a table edge happily. Her legs playfully kicked through the air under the table. \"My father has taken quite an interest in you. I've never seen someone so...weak being the IDP before.\" You had no time for her insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?! What are you talking about?\" You demanded. She only giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How impolite of me! I'm Molly!\" She held out a hand to shake, but you ignored it and still wanted to know more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what are you...?!\" You yelled out. She didn't giggle that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you tell? Not only are you weak, but you're not that bright either. I'm an Anti.\" She smirked a sinister smile after her answer. An Anti? But...she spoke normal...and acted normal! Like a human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you say your father, what does he mean when he wants you to...<i>study</i> me?\" You questioned. Molly took a bit to answer, as she continued to softly kick legs under the table edge she sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a seventeen year old girl who lied about her age and abilities to be able to sign up for the IDP.\" She began to accuse. She...however...was right! You cheated the written assessments by lying about your age/talents in combat! She even continued, \"You have interest in art and psychology, but you have a strange phobia of being underwater. You live...or should I say...<i>lived</i> with your brother. He's 24 and owns an apartment building, Eastwood Road, Room 340, where he became your legal guardian after your parents died in a car crash four years ago. <i>How tragic</i>. He began to work for the IDP, supposed to keep his job a secret but believed in telling you the honest truth when he said he had to work. For three and a half years he destroyed and pestered my father's Anti army, that until...he went <i>missing</i>. In attempt to find him, you joined the IDP, hoping to find your poor lost brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like falling to the floor. She had basically said your life story, knowing the details about your brother and why you joined the IDP! But...h-how? Molly laughed out again. \"Honestly. I don't know what my father is trying to find in you of what we <i>already</i> know!\" You felt rage fill your mind, pressuring your brain to just yell at her in anger. A knock on the door suddenly broke your attention as it opened up. Varen gave a curious look at you through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie...? Are you alright? You look like you just saw a ghost!\" He worriedly asked. You looked back at the table, but Molly was gone. You pressed a hand against your aching forehead, feeling the cold sweat bead out. \"Y-yeah...I'm fine. How's Sern?\" You decided to get your mind off your trauma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, I haven't checked on him. He's in the building next door if you want to see him, but I'm sure he's fine.\" Varen answers. He nudges away from the door frame as you exit the building. You heard the mages chant a strange language in the building with the infected villagers as you walked next door. Not even bothering about asking, you enter the building Sern was supposed to be in, finding him...</span></div></div>",

You walked inside while knocking on the door. Sern looked up at you, dropping an agitated expression and continued to look down at his wound. He had trouble wrapping the cloth around his shoulder with using only one hand, and occasionally had it slip or unwind off. You step closer to the reptile as he continued to ignore you, saying, \"Sern, I'm sorry for what I did, but I was only trying to help.\" He still looked away from you. You continued, \"But, I want you to know that you don't have to force someone away, even if they're just willing to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried one last time to wrap the cloth over the injury, but it fumbled in his grip, and it fell back off. You stepped next to the anti-social anthro, saying, \"Turn around. I'll wrap it around your shoulder for you. After all, it's the least I can do.\" He avoided eye contact, but he turned his back to you as you sat on the bed, taking the white pillow case. \"Take your chest-piece off, or the wound may become infected from what's on the padding armor.\" He silently took of his padded IDP over-shirt, setting it to the side. He wore a small white under-tee from within the chest-piece, giving off more shining colors of his emerald scales. You placed the cloth over his splitting wound, tying it firmly around the injury, staining the white case with a dark crimson liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing off the knot, you sigh out, \"There, you can put your torso-wear on now.\" He places the IDP padding back over himself as yo turn and wash your blood covered hands in a bowl of water set in a toiletries room. Turning around, you see Sern, looking at you, seeming...sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop acting kind to me.\" He softly demanded. The command dug a spike inside your chest. He rejected courtesy? But, he continued before you could speak. \"Stop acting kind. You only make things feel worse for me.\" The eyes of the anthro looked away, disapproving your nice gesture. He grabbed his blade placed on the table by the bed and left the building, leaving you to stand alone the room, at a loss of words.</span></div></div>",

Unluckily, they crowded the streets, and you weren't able to find Sern everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the paths, searching for your team member. You accidentally bump into a smooth wall, almost causing you to fall to the ground. You look up an see that you ran into a naga woman! Her long body sported red scales all along the stretching tail, with black spots traveling down them with yellow outlines around them. her underside was a pale yellow as you noticed she wore a leather chest piece, seared with gold. Golden wristbands on her arms reflected the sunset's light, as her necklace did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you...\" You uncomfortably say to her, \"I was just searching for someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga woman looks down at you, but with a bright happy smile. \"Oh no my dear, that's quite alright!

Then again, no one was truly at fault for anything in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left out of the door, you heard him softly say, \"<i>I'm sorry I scratched you...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lifted your spirits some, knowing that Sern was at least trying to change his ways. you were pretty sure that there was a good person deep down in Sern, he just didn't know it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter seemed quiet for you, even when everyone else around you was talking, happy and relieved that the mission was a success.

If it was night time in the fantasy realm, should it also be night time in your realm? You looked back at all of your encounters today, remembering your near death experience with the Anti in the pool of water, the strange Anti girl Molly who's father had a strange interest in you. You shivered from whatever that meant. You also thought back on the Elf woman that turned out be the knight. You felt bad that you couldn't save her, but Sern couldn't be blamed. In fact, he was just trying to save you from being beheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Sern, you wondered why he joined the IDP after of what he told you about. The IDP were involved with the death of his wife and daughter, so, shouldn't someone like Sern hold a grudge about that? Unless, he was doing it for other reasons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head hurt from thinking about so much in your tired mind.

His face looked concerned that you decided to at least see what he was jotting down before you went to bed, even if you felt like collapsing on the floor from exhaustion. Stepping up from behind, you sit back into the couch next to him, scaring the poor anthro fox. He quickly yelped in surprise from not noticing you, fumbling his journal and pen in his hands that they fell to the floor in a loud <i>pop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Melanie...I uh...didn't hear you coming...!\" You decided to skip his awkward excuses and picked up the journal he accidentally dropped. \"Melanie! P-please don't read that!\" He begged when you held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Varen, I wasn't going to look at it. I was just picking it up for you.\" You held it to him, and he seemed to blush behind his fur in embarrassment as he slowly took the book from you. He seemed to calm down and relax. \"What exactly has you on edge lately. Every time I see you working or writing in papers, you're so easily scared like something's going to attack you.\" He just held the book tighter as he glanced at it, frowning a bit. \"It may not be my business, but what's making you so nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and looked at you. It was a kind of glance you've never seen before from Varen, ever. He looked, disappointingly sad. \"Melanie, there...is something I'm having a bit of a conundrum with.\" He began to explain. He opened his journal, revealing pages of speeches, long billeted notes and ideas, thoughts and expressions. You were confused about what he was trying to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father in the Were dimension is a wealthy entrepreneur that owns multiple businesses. He's a very powerful business man in my realm, and a large political icon. Sadly, he's getting to that time of retiring, and he's entrusting me with all of his ownership of his companies.\" That shocked you a bit. You know that Varen could probably be successful at it, especially being good at mathematics and problem solving, but seeing him as a powerful business leader? That was a slim chance.</span></div></div>",

He stood up, throwing the journal flat against the table, looking away from it. \"<i>I hate politics</i>.\" Varen grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox surely did have a problem, even if it didn't have to do with shooting and killing Anti.

Give advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Varen, if your father were to, I don't know, give the business to someone else...who might that be...?\" You asked.

You somehow reorganized my focus again!\" You only asked him one single question about the inheritance, but that little inquire was just enough force to tweak Varen in the right direction of solving his own predicament. You stood up, seeing that your job was done. And you could finally rest! Varen picked his filled journal once more, tossing it into a trash bin. \"The reports on you don't lie, Melanie. You do have a good favorable interest in psychology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, you say, \"Your welcome Varen.

You were ordered by Kent to rest for the day from having encounters that could cause serious traumas for people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost drowned yesterday, and had to watch the knight who turned out to be an elf woman get gouged in her throat, dying directly in front of you as her infected black Anti blood seem to splatter on you.

You looked over to Sern\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door and a light was lit under it. You felt an urge to talk to him about what he recently told you, but you doubted he would want to. Still, there were dark things about Sern, and he clearly beckoned for help, and you think you figured out why Sern joined the IDP in the first place. However, there was only one way to find out. You hopped up from the couch, feeling a bit nervous as you approached his door. You bravely raised a hand and tapped it against the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a shuffle, but nothing more. It seems Sern didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care if you entered or not. Opening the door, you were taken a bit back when you discovered how his living quarters looked. Everything was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6bland and organized. There was no decoration, no objects, barely any furniture, and only a lamp and the sun shining through the window could light room up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSern was sitting at the edge of his bed, with his elbows placed on his knees and his hands curled into fists which he rested his head on. He glared at you, until sighing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want now, girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He impatiently asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenge, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You asked. His head raised a bit, as his angry glanced switched to a confused expression. You continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou joined the IDP so you could help find the person who killed your family.

A brown-furred hand waved out between the crevice of a closet door, with Varen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muffled voice answering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack here, but give me a minute\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your eyes, you head over to his bed side, sweeping a few journals off to make room for you to sit down. You could hear shuffling behind the closet door, which peaked your interest in what the socially awkward canine was up to. To kill some time, you asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, exactly how long is this party your father is hosting going to last? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just hoping that this little simple plan of yours will not crash and burn on you. No offense, of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Varen chuckled at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know Melanie, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not too confident about this plan either. After all, all of my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company owners, business partners, financial buddies, personal friends, and a lot of my family shall be attending this ceremony in his estate, which means I get the honor of humiliating the poor old fox in front of everyone he knows. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little pressuring, you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He answered back. Finally, the closet door opened, revealing Varen in a strange fashion. He was wearing a tuxedo suit! His white collared shirt displayed its brightness under the jet black vest jacket, with chuffed sleeves and dark dress pants that he even had a black tie to go with the outfit. He even had a small corsage pocketed against his chest. He opened his arms wide a bit, asking while inspecting his body, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, how do I look for an educated business leader?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDorky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He raised a brow in the exaggerated remark and continued looking at his dressed frame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy family tends to be somewhat strict on the dress code for this, so I suppose this old suit will have to do for now. But I if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say so myself, <i>I look pretty sexy</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He mentioned while staring at his perky reflection through a walled mirror, wagging his bushy tail energetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t flatter yourself, Varen. I doubt you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be getting girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 specific attention after your destroy your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s empire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You replied. The fox instantly grew pale. He shook the feeling away and glanced back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMelanie. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry about what happened earlier with Sern. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He spoke out. You held up a hand to stop from saying anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pull a guilt trip on me. Anything back there was none of our faults. So, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just say it never happened and try to just focus on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You sat up briskly from the bed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to say when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on stage?\u00e2\u0080\u009d you changed the topic, gladly receiving a smirk from the anthro fox as he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaren walked towards his front door, stopping at the open frame to look back and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking an IDP van to the Were Dimension. I should be back tomorrow afternoon at the latest, so uh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6wish me luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t me to come with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You asked back. He only shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike I said last night, humans are not allowed to the party since my father doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affiliate himself with them. Just tell Kent that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m out getting some stuff from home so everyone will not get too suspicious. Alright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He gave a puppy dog stare to you a pathetic begging manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFine\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You admitted. He reflected a quick smile before disappearing into the elevator.</span></div></div>",

There was no way you were just going to let Varen ditch out on something that could effect the entire team and his career. You were going to the ceremony, and you going to support your friend whether he likes it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you didn't exactly have a plan on how to trail Varen into the Were dimension or how you could sneak into his father's estate, yet you cared less about that. You assured yourself that you'll come up with a plan along the way. Just then, you remembered that the observation table within the lobby displays a holographic map in any known IDP area. Maybe you could use it to find the rifts to the Were dimension...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your door and get a abrupt surprise. Officer Kent was standing at your doorway with his arms crossed. You immediately jolt in your skin from the sudden moment as you back up a little. Your team captain raised a brow before asking, \"Melanie, do you know where Varen has run off to? He wasn't given orders or permission to leave the premises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently gulp in response as you stammer for the right words, \"...I heard he's heading to the Were dimension for something he needs from home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour team captain leaned a little closer, smiling, \"I think there's a little more to it than that. You don't have to hide it from me Melanie. I heard the entire conversation between the two of you the entire time.\" Your face grew pale, but you just nod as an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard us talking? I thought you went out with Alice and Evan to deliver that package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent chuckled a bit in his weird whole-hearted way. To you, he was an odd choice of a leader since he could be his mid thirties yet he could act like a child sometimes. He responded, \"No...it turns out that Officer Foster (Alice) said that she didn't need my company for the delivery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, because Evan went with her.\" You answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent gave you a weird look. \"Sure. Anyways, I came back after I watched Sern storm out from his room all upset. I'm surprised the lizard could show any emotion at all.\" You slightly winced when he mentioned Sern. You wondered if the poor guy was alright. Ryan Kent looked back down to you, explaining, \"Grab a dress. We're sneaking into that estate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there for a moment, silent and dumb-like. \"You're...going to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am. I don't let my team members walk a mission alone. I'll call Officer Foster and Muller back over to head quarters, and once they get here, we're all heading into the Were dimension.\" Kent walked to his own quarters as you were left to sit at your doorway. You were glad that he was willing to get the team together for Varen's sake, but what was the dress for? Varen's father was hosting a formal party, but even in the gown, everyone could tell that you were 100% human. Kent seemed to have a plan, so you put your faith in him and headed to your closet.</span></div></div>",

It was the seventh time you've done it, but you wanted to make sure you were perfect for this party. You had no idea why you were so enthusiastic about this particular job, however you had a slight idea for the reason. This would be an actual mission without involving guns, Anti creatures, near death experiences, and all of the other stressful mess you had to go through in the past two days. You were simply showing up somewhere just to make sure your friend was safe and well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride your palms down your hips, hoping to get a decent appearance. Across your body glimmered a strapless black dress, speckled with spots of glitter that shined like diamonds as you balanced yourself on black high heels. A silver necklace that shined out a miniscule rainbow like chrome metal, with a matching pair of studded earrings to sport an elegant look. You smiled brightly, thanking yourself that you had even bothered to pack this with your things when you first joined the IDP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the lights, you exit your quarters and enter the observation lobby where to your surprise, your entire team was waiting! (Excluding Varen.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Evan remained at the desk, with Alice shaking her head in a miserable manner. \"Ryan, this is completely degrading.\" The blonde headed woman was adorning a marvelous scarlet red dress that puffed out in the lower half. Both Kent and Miller snickered together at Alice as they sported on their own suits. With an even better surprise, Sern was there too! The lizard man was turned away, facing and looking out of a window silently in a completely jet black suit and no decoration. Officer Kent looked towards you, smiling as he called you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, about time you got out of there. I've already informed and prepared Ali...<i>Officer Foster</i> and Miller here about the current situation. Sern is even on board.\" You blush slightly as you make your way to the desk everyone was located by. You couldn't explain how thankful you were that Kent understandable on this job. \"We can follow Varen by the IDP van he probably used to get into the anthro realm. Tracking devices are placed into all IDP vehicles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Officer Kent.\" You stress out to say. He listens up as you ask, \"How do you expect to sneak in? We can't show up publicly at the party because humans aren't technically the owner's favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent nods as he nudges strange objects laying atop the desk. \"That's what these are for. Just place one around your wrist, Melanie.\" Your heels clop loudly over to the observation table as you inspect the devices. They're formed together like an armband, so you place against your skin, causing a jolt to sound out. You wince from the shock as a screen lights up against its side. Kent reached over and dials a few keypads on the screen, tensing you up for the device's true intentions. A bright flash flickers around your body up and down, almost blinding you from the sheer sight. After your eyes regress back to their focus, you come to find everyone simply staring at you. You feel no different except for the disorientation by the light, which confused you on what the device did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...What happened?\" You curiously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice smiled, \"Take a look.\" In her crossed arms, she pointed a single finger towards a window. You approach it, discovering for a third time, a surprise. Your reflection was not of you, but of an anthro cat girl! You had transformed into a brown tabby cat with a similar hair style of what your had previously. Your hair had worked for your hair color, as the short fuzz had spread over your entire body. You reach up to touch your cat ears with your small clawed hands, however, the digits simply go right through them to your disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent's voice spoke behind you, \"It's only a hologram surrounding your body to disguise it. Anything that wasn't a part of your body will act like a real projection if made into contact, so be weary of that fact.\" Suddenly, more flashes expounded, emitting another mirage of light before it faded. Kent had taken the form of a German shepard dog that fit perfectly around his muscular form, whereas Alice was projected as a cheetah from the characteristic of her bright golden hair, and finally Evan Miller had been fixated as an intimidating. You attempted to hold back your laughing from the sight of animals in costumes for a party. Sern would of course remain the same, being an anthro and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, real funny, Kent.\" Miller sneered through his muzzle as he inspected his body. \"You programmed this to be specifically a <i>black</i> bear, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent winked at him as Miller scoffed in a remark. He lit a cigarette and popped it into his mouth, puffing out a small cloud as he asked, \"Well, we ready to go to this dumb joint or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Kent walked over to the elevator while answering, \"Yes we are. Now I expect no slip-ups or scenes to occur on this job. It's called 'undercover' for a reason. Officer Miller, you're driving. I'll get the GPS to locate Varen's van once we get through the rift. We're making contact with locals to a bare minimum, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" Everyone spoke out as Sern nodded.</span></div></div>",

But there were a few who looked a bit startled, but they were different. One of them was pink and fleashy, but had a shadow around her. The shadow was the shape of a dragon. There were a few others like this. They looked around and ran, mimiking the pink, fleashy creatures.

Beside me, Ardacon dropped to all fours, ready to spring after the retreating mob of gesticulating creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, Ard, they don't seem dangerous. I think we should try and-\" I broke off and doubled over, gagging and retching. A smell had reached me from down the hard pathway- alien and yet familiar. It was not unlike the rot of carrion, the exotic tang of lightning, or the decaying smell creatures gave off when deathly sick. All of these could be unpleasant, but only as the sight of a decaying carcass, the sound of thunder overhead, or the feel of dying body were all discomforting in their own unique right. The ill-feelings lay in what was actually being perceived, not the simple observance of it. <i>This</i> scent, though, was in sharp contrast to the rule.           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was faint but horrible, making me shake in primal revulsion as it descended down my sinuses like a virus. My head felt cold, but the fur on my body was suddenly uncomfortably hot. I felt the edges of my skin flicker, threatening to revert to my smaller, less bestial, form. Whatever this exotic spoor was, my body, on some deep level, liked it less than I did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ardacon slowly recovered his posture and his breath from his own reflexively induced panting. \"Aw, <i>damm</i>, what is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Out of the corner of my eye, a new stranger, but squat, pure black and... Hazy, in a way, was rapidly approaching. I snorted the last of the scent out of my snout, stood up straighter to accost it, and nearly blanched when I realized the smell was coming from it.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you? Where are we?\" I called, feeling the fur on the back of my neck spiking like it was trying to lift off my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thing - as I got a better look at it, I decided that 'person' was far too generous a term- was nearly as tall as I was; an eight foot stack of black goop, twitching and undulating as it bore down on us. Aside from the smell, which I was starting to slowly adapt to tolerate without passing out, there was something that I couldn't place. Whatever lack of business me and Ardacon had here, this thing should not have been around far more than us. It's basic presence was inconsistent, aberrant, wrong.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It didn't respond to my inquests, but instead accelerated and shot out an inky tentacle for my torso. I yelped and swatted it away, feeling its poor imitation flesh bulge and shudder away from the impact. \"Get back!\" It didn't even slow under my rebuke, and I leapt farther backwards, swiping at the tendrils issuing from its' gelatinous body in growing numbers. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A limb terminating in a blunt blade slashed across at chest height. I ducked, lashing forward and out to rake my claws down it's front. With satisfaction I felt it's rubbery surface part under my claws with only slightly more resistance than thick mud. A thin fluid dribbled from the cut, and I gagged as the smell worsened dramatically.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Somewhere nearby, a hunting howl sounded out as Ardacon flew through the air, landing on the creature's  tapered apex and clawing savagely. A squadron of black limbs pulled from the thing's upper body to pound away at him, only increasing his frenzy. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two larger appendages beset me, firing chopping motions at my head rapidly, before pulling back to strike snake-like from different angles. The 'skin' on it's arms seemed to be hardening as we fought; whenever I scratched them as I knocked them away, the flesh broke with greater difficulty and the blood-like putrescence trickled out in increasingly shallow dosages. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ardacon howled again, seizing a tentacle pounding at his head between two fists and biting it clear off. Snarling as the others continued bruising, he flung it at the ground, where I distantly noted that it writhed and started squirming away -before a tentacle bashed me up-side the head. Star-like spots of color flickered across my vision as I eagerly stepped forward into it's grasp, redoubling my flurry of slashing claws. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The reek was thick in the air now, as, soundless, the thing fought on. it could manipulate its flesh, but only somewhat. It hardened, but was still permeable, the ends of it's built in weapons narrowed, but never became true blades. It punched and slammed out at us, but unlike us, could not truly cut or breach the skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But if it felt pain, it never demonstrated any hindrance from it, and if it was tiring at all under the exertion of the struggle, it wasn't showing. Ardacon gave an unassuming  grunt as a thick limb formed beneath him and shot upwards, slamming into his gut with enough force to knock him flying through the air and out of my vision. With only that as a warning, the thing lurched forward, a half dozen frsh tentacles bursting forth to ensnare me as a grotesque cavity writhing with slime opening in its front while it reeled me in.                                               </span></div></div>",

She could best you right now &amp; she was only 7 ft. \"I don't know,\" you said, \"Remember what happend to my father?\" \"Nonsense,\" Tsubaki said smiling, \"We're a team &amp; thats what team mates do: Help each other.\" \"Also you got help from me &amp; my team,\" Drago said, \"We are eager to help out.\" All of his team nods in agreement. A smile then comes to your face. \"Thanks guys,\" you said letting out a tear, \"This means alot to me.\" \"With any luck, we can get your sister out before Negative can react,\" Del Toro said. \"So how do we do it?\" Kiba asked. You knew Kiba had a point. If she had been infected for 20 years, the Negative energy probably had time to manifest &amp; make her stronger.</span></div></div>",

As he left the room you heard his mother ask to speak to him. \"Why must you always be so hard on him?\" Drago's mother asked, \"You act as if you don\u2019t even want him.\" \"That's because I don\u2019t,\" his father says back, \"All he is and ever will be is a mistake between me and another woman before we met.\" \"Is that how you feel about our other children?\" his mother asked. \"No,\" he replied, \"They were planned, they are the ones who might actually make me proud and amount to something.\" <i>Thats not nice</i>, you thought. \"Guess that\u2019s why you hate him,\" Sven said. The screen faded as another memory appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 14<br>\r\nYou saw Drago standing on a cliff. \"I remember this.\" Sven said. You watched as a high school looking Drago nervously looked over to the younger anthro fox and the wolf who were smiling. \"You can do this,\" they called over to him as he ran and leaped off the cliff. Drago's wings opened and for the first time he was flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nDrago graduated college that day and signed up for a career in the military. It then changed to later in that year. He was patrolling a village where many residents were being executed for counts of conspiracy many houses were being burnt to the ground. \"Kaiser,\" his Sergeant called. \"Yes Sir,\" Drago replied instantly. \"Come here,\" his Sergeant said. He followed him into a large house. There was a ladder leading to the attic. \"Check up there,\" he said. \"Affirmative,\" Drago replied climbing the ladder. Once up there you see about thirty children and about half as many adults. They all looked at him. \"Kaiser, is there anything up there?\" his Sergeant called. They stared at him, he saw in the low light fear in their eyes awaiting your response. \"Nothing here sir,\" you called down, \"all empty.\" He climbed down the ladder and his squad left. The memory changed to a firefight between Drago's patrol unit and enemies. The three other members of his squad and Drago was captured and made Prisoners of War. In the prison it was horrible. They made him wear a steel muzzle to prevent breathing fire and they never removed it so he couldn't eat so he was pretty much starved. Eventually his team was freed. He immediately returned home as he was gone for nine months. He was told to get to the hospital. The view changed to him entering a hospital room. A female dragon lying in the bed crying out in agony. She looked at him surprised. Eventually everything was over and the doctor handed the baby to him and said here\u2019s your son. You and the others looked at him and smiled.</span></div></div>",

A few days later. He is walking home late at night when he noticed that someone was following him. After reaching a clearing between buildings he turned around to confront this person. He is hooded. He ran at him unsheathing two daggers. He fought with him but he jammed the first dagger into Drago's leg and put the other one straight through his heart. He ran away leaving him to die. Everything around him froze. A creature shrowded in darkness aproached his dying body. \"You want revenge, dont you?\" he asked. He nodded. \"Very well Kaiser, follow me.\" he said as a black portal opened behind him. He staggered after him as he walked through. The memory changed to the next day. His uncle walked through the street surrounded by guards, he watched from the rooftops. The two daggers in hand.He looked at his daggers they were as sharp as they were in that memory. He followed his uncle until there were many people to watch him die.You walked off the edge of the building and approached him. He called him and he froze as he heard his voice. Drago knew he was the one who ordered the assassin to kill him. \"I challenge you to a duel.\" he said. He agreed, a foolish mistake. You both fought with swords. After knocking his sword away, Drago dropped his sword and stabbed him with the daggers. Drago walked away leaving him to die. As he walked into an alley way. The creature appeared again. \"You got your revenge,\" he said, \"Now do I have your alleigance?\" \"Yes Phantom,\" Drago replied. The memory changed to Drago and three others on one knee with a sword infront of each of him. As Phantom entered he ordered each of you to stand. \"Rise Necro, Shade, Kaiser, Negative. You four have proven yourselves to be my best students.\" The memory changed to Drago and the others you were badly wounded and they were trying to help. \"Leave him,\" Phantom ordered, \"he`s served his purpose.\" As Negative stood up he attached a small explosive device to him. You looked at the commander. He didn't notice you looking at him. <i>Don't worry John</i>, you thought, <i>I promise to help you cure Shaun</i>.</span></div></div>",

Do you think it could mend Drago's wings?\" \"Hmm I was thinking about that,\" Jin said, \"It's worth a shot, but we would need the commanders petition.\" \"Well why don't we pay Drago a visit,\" Kiba said, \"I'm sure he's feeling a bit left out.\" \"Drago, get back to your bed,\" you whispered.

He took out his battle-axe and held it high above his head and started to twirl it like a baton. \"For this to work, I need a lift about 10 feet into the air,\" he said. \"I can do it, just tell me when,\" Donald said. Del nodded as he continued to spin the battle-axe &amp; it's rotation  speed was increasing. The dragon was struggling to get free from the icicle pin Donald made but no avail. Dels battle-axe spins so fast it's almost invisible. \"NOW!\" Del shouted. You watched Del was launched streight up 10 feet. \"<i>Remember what I said</i>,\" the dragon said. You nodded. \"Helicoptor Hack!\" Del yelled as he threw his spinning battle-axe and it lands right on the dragon's neck causing it to roar in pain. Del fell back down only to have his fall broken by a wind current Donald made. The dragon is soon decapitated, it's lifeless body and head soon disappears leaving Dels battle-axe planted blade down in the ground. You went over to where the dragon was. You saw an orb with a small dragon in it. You grabbed it &amp; you felt energy run through you. You then went back to the others. Donald had just got out his communicator. \"Donald to commander, park situation resolved,\" he said. \"Good work, I saw the whole thing,\" the commander replied. \"Commander, somehow Donald knows about Shaun,\" you said. \"I know, everyone report back to HQ and head to the meeting room. I have a long and painful story to tell,\" the commander replied. You all head back to HQ.</span></div></div>",

Del Toro? Wait a minute didn't I resign?Yes, you did, replied the commander.But things got complicated and with both Donald and Del Toro out of action, we're shorthanded. So I had no choice then to recall you.Your head hurts with all the memories flooding back then you remembered why you resigned.How did this happen?you say rejoining the conversation.The commander goes to Donald's Laptop.Mind if I borrow this Donald?he asks.Sure replies Donald.The commander takes out a DVD and puts it in the disk drive and it shows footage of the others fighting against an Anti that looks like Donald and a young human female who you assume to be Molly.I have no idea how she got past security but I'll make sure that she won't set foot in IDP again.Kiba comes in with Sven.You both exchange nods.Hey Donald, I`d like for you to meet my brother Sven Kiba says.Hello Sven Donald says.Hello, nice to meet you Sven replies.Oh, almost forgot. That's Del Toro over there Kiba says pointing to Del.Hello Del Toro Sven says shaking his hand.Hello Sven, Kiba told us all about you.Del replied.Whoa, what did Molly do?You ask seeing him fully.I'm not sure what she did, but I felt drained and sick when she finished.Jin came in I can answer that he said I analyzed both Donald's and Del Toro's readings.What she did was she casted a spell that syphoned off their negative energy.Can you explain more? The commander said.Yes,replied Jin,Every creature has both positive and negative engery to keep active, without negative energy, they drain faster then a cheap battery.Is there a solution?Del asked.Yes, but it won't be easy.says Jin,Since Molly used your dark energies to create your dark clones, the clones have to be defeated perminently.I tried battling Donald's clone, and it was incredibly evasive.Del said.I know, I was there. Good thing Donald saved your life.I'll leave you all to catch up, while I speak to Sven.Both the commander and Sven leave.Suddenly, a sound came out of Donald's Laptop.</span></div></div>",

Donald says \"Wrex, your under arrest for the murder of IDP agent Jai.\" You pick up Jai's body as Charlotte then cries \"How can this happen?\" She says tearingly \"And all the trouble we went through of getting his memory back.\" Razorback and Snowball hold Wrex while Del heps you hold Jai.</span></div></div>",

What? we all think, I look up and see a dark spirit. \"Is that Jai!?\" Del said surprisingly. Charlotte looked at Jai with tears of joy coming from her. \"Nobody hurts my friends!\" Jai said to the dragon angrily. The dragon let out a roar at Jai. Jai then transforms into what appears to be a mix of shark and dragon. Everyone was shocked about this. Jai roared at the dragon and the dragon roared back. Both gave each other sharp glares.</span></div></div>",

For this reason he\u2019s stronger than the common servant but, not as strong as a fighter of the warrior caste. During his existence he has met many creatures of the underground and some of the open ground, sometimes managing with his cunning, while other times requiring the support of his brute strength.<br>\r\nAs a member of the Hive, he\u2019s always under the scrutiny of  the same, sharing his thoughts with all of his brothers and sister, under the supreme rule of their Goddess Irulia. <br>\r\nAs we see him, he\u2019s approaching an abandoned enemy base, where there have been rumors of mysterious disappearances that he has to investigate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tKyrwil, The Engineer<br>\r\nKyrwil has been granted the title of Engineer for his apt mind in solving technical problems in construction matters. Thanks to his quick mind an entire section of the hive, where the new members of the Colony had to live, was digged and prepared in time for the new fertilized eggs of the Hive Queen Irulia. Often the Hive Queen commended him for his mind and for his unusual capacity of thinking outside of the collectivity, managing enormous advantages for the entire colony.<br>\r\nKyrwil is not a common worker though. Bred and prepared to be a warrior, he has at his disposal a strength quite uncommon even within the warrior class. What he lacks is the necessary rigidity of mind to obey any order given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially he had been shunned for that reason but, when his true talent emerged he was one of the few who managed to meet the Hive Queen face to face. <br>\r\nWe see him as he moves with his team of diggers to start the excavation for the new expansion of the colony in a territory where many where known to have vanished without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\tSomeone else\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In this City a Secret Organization called IDP (Inter-Dimensional Patrol) stand guard over the humans who live there, protecting them and keeping them in the dark about the creatures who arrives through the ripples in the time-space continuum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything start in a rundown part of this city, where an IDP Squad is sent to investigate an high energy reading from one of these ripples in the area. The squad arrives with celerity through a brief fly in a chopper and is left to roam the streets in search of any UAC, Unidentified Alien Creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sergeant of the squad is a veteran of the IDP, a battle scarred man who had plenty of operations under his belt. The same could not be said for his team of five. These were rookies, freshly out of training course and, although some of the had been experts  in human warfare, it was their first mission with the IDP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they silently moved through the streets, each of them look around constantly, trying to be always aware of their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBase, Bravo Leader here, come in Base.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBL, here is Base.

No energy readings anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck again BL. We\u2019ve had a large energy reading no more than twenty minutes ago in that area. There must be something there. Report only if UAC is detected. Over and out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sargeant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only rookie he didn\u2019t want to listen, the youngest of them, the only one who hadn\u2019t never been on a battlefield, spoke with a tremble in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2019s going on? S-Sarge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph Kurts, Sergeant Joseph Kurts, almost spat on the ground in disgust. Here he was, member of one of the most powerful and secret of the world organizations, and had to babysit a, freshly out of the academy, Lieutenant.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSir, Base confirm the presence of a UAC in the area. But our sensors aren\u2019t picking anything yet. Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sarge\u2026Have you\u2026Have you tried to check\u2026 underground?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoseph was almost out of his nerves. This wet lips of an officer was really trying to get on his nerves with her foolish questions. He made to answer back with a cold cutting edge just as he noticed said girl pointing to a large hole in the middle of the cemented street. Suddenly he hadn\u2019t any more words to express.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I hadn\u2019t seen that\u2026Sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026It\u2019s alright, Sergeant. I\u2019ve almost fallen in it myself, before noticing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the squad moved around the hole, their sensors began to pick up traces of energy radiation coming from it. The thing that they had been sent to search had to be in that hole in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Squad! Break time is over. Take defensive position around the hole as we lower the scanners inside it. We\u2019ll soon see if \u2026Lieutenant? Sir? Step back from there. That\u2019s too close to the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, everybody could see a large arm snake out of the hole, grabbing the girl\u2019s head as it pulled her inside the pit. Before any of them could even react, the Lieutenant disappeared into the darkness of the underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl Carter had been promoted with the highest grade out of the Military academy. She had been the brightest student of her entire class and so, her CV, was instantly sent to IDP which approved it almost as fast. Even though she had never set foot in the field, she was already considered ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had loved the academy. On paper everything seemed so easy. She had dreamed so much of being in the field, ready to out-maneuver her adversary with her proficiency in tactics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never imagined she could be kidnapped by an unknown life being and dragged underground. She struggled as much as she could but the hold on her was stronger than anything she could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she realized her unknown assailant had stopped and freed her, leaving her in this cave-like tunnel without any light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hello? Hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Greetings, human-ling</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost shrieked when she heard the raspy voice no more than three meters from her, coming out of the utter darkness they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We mean you no harm\u2026until you do not harm us, of course</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026How many of\u2026 you are here.?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c<i>It is only Us. We, seems to be in an unknown place. We, seeks answers.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl couldn\u2019t understand what was happening, her mind wasn\u2019t ready to process the fact that she was who knows how many meters underground, talking with a UAC. She simply didn\u2019t reason it, in order to avoid a total shut down of her brain functions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you? Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We are known as the Ktywxylsixs. Which name cannot be pronounced in your primitive language. The best translation in this language is \u2018The Hive\u2019. <br>\r\nThis one has been named Kroggan but, you may address us as Speaker</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHive? Speaker? W-Wait a\u2026How do you speak my language!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We have mentally siphoned it out of you. We have not touched your memories or thoughts, yet. Give us answers and We will let you go free</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, crouched low on the ground, began to change position, sitting there, with her knees crossed. Seeing that the UAC didn\u2019t seem violent or aggressive, she was ready to establish a first communication with it\u2026with them\u2026with the Speaker, in order to learn as much as she could before she was rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she hoped she was going to be rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Alright. I will answer your question, as you will do in turn, agreed? Also, could you move closer? I really can\u2019t see you within this darkness</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raspy voice of the Speaker echoed slightly in the tunnels as he answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Doesn\u2019t your species have the capability of seeing in the dark? That is most unsettling. <br>\r\nWe will provide light for you. As for your treaty\u2026We can accept that</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl suddenly saw some light pouring out in the tunnel, those tiny points seemed to move closer until she could clearly see what they were exactly. Fascinated, she watched as dozens of short, fat worms moved to stand at almost one meter from her. Their bodies glowing in the darkness, releasing the soothing light she was now in. Her eyes, then, were focusing on the creature moving toward her. As she watched it come closer, she couldn\u2019t  believe herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt moved on six powerful legs, culminating in three toed like talons, while supporting its elongated main body, just like the one on a terrestrial ant. Attached to this there was this humanoid torso, from which sprouted two strong sets of arms, with four fingered \u2018hands/claws\u2019. Its head was human looking in shape, but there ended the similarities. Three small sets of eyes looked in all directions at once, with a light green tint, while the skin seemed much more tough and resilient almost as if it was really an armor. But the most distinctive tract was the mouth, without any lips or teeth, as it seemed to Cheryl, but with two strange looking appendages just at each corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Cheryl had to admit, the creature seemed ult of an impossible union between an Ant and a Human.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Speaker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes. We are here. Now, what is the name of this world</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is called Earth\u2026is\u2026is the Fourth planet in its solar system.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We really are not under our Great Above. The Gods may have mercy on our souls.  Ask now, it\u2019s your turn\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had to breathe fire that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy girl is gone. The cops in Gate City aren't exactly on top of the case. I can't go home. What do I do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sora road his hover board down the street, thinking about what the day had in store for him. Today was the last day of testing Sora needed to do in order to join the IDP. If Sora passed he would be aloud to leave the mythical dimension and go to Gate City, the headquarters of the IDP which resides in the human realm. There he would become a soldier and fight the Anti to defend the dimensions. Sora was actually happy that today was the last day of testing, over the past few days all Sora had to do was study and learn as instructors taught a class filled with potential candidates for the IDP. At the end of each day every student would take a written test, it was required that every student pass each test with a C or Above, and of course today of all day Sora was running late. But maybe just maybe he would make it. The test started at 9:45, Sora looked at his phone and saw that it was 9:36 right this moment. Sora was just around the corner of the IDP building that rested in the middle of Mythical city. It was the biggest building in the whole entire city, and it didn\u2019t take long for Sora to see in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora arrived at the IDP with only 4 minutes to spare. Upon entering the front door Sora got off his hover board and sprinted towards the elevator. Their were 50 floors in total and the test took place on the 10th floor. The elevator was slow, as it got to the 10th floor Sora had only 2 minutes left. The elevator doors opened to reveal long white hallways, each with countless doors with their own rooms. Sora was looking for room number 163, which lucky for him resided at the end of the hallway. Sora ran as fast as he could down a seeming endless hallway until finally he reached his destination room 163. As soon as Sora reached the door he quickly opened it and stepped through with only one minute left to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora stood in awe at what he was looking at. Sora  stood on a wide platform, a platform that rested on the side of the IDP building. At the center of the platform were the letters IDP, and at the sides of the wide platform rested steel rail that prevented anyone from falling off the sides. Sora looked at the bright blue sky as the wind blew through his Snow White hair, Sora didn\u2019t like high places but even he had to admit this was pretty cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was the last person to arrive, the other students where all huddled together in the middle of the platform. Sora makes his way to the group of students and couldn\u2019t help but realize that there were less students this time around. Sora knew that their was only one conclusion, the other students, the other candidates didn\u2019t pass the written tests, and therefore where sent home. At the beginning of the test to join the IDP their around a hundred candidates but now there was only around 20. So it made it hard for Sora to sneak into the crowd without being noticed by the instructor that stood in the middle explaining the next test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr Silver tail it is so good of you to join us.\u201d The instructor said with a stern tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit\u201d Sora thought. In your experience whenever someone called you by your last name you where in trouble, and this instructor was the last person you wanted to piss off. Her name was Enna Sundy or as her enemies called her the lady of ice. We of course called her Instructor Sundy. Instructor Sundy is a powerful ice dragon, and rumor has it that she comes from a ancient lineage which makes her even more powerful, so yea the last thing Sora wanted to do was piss this chick off. Sundy wore a IDP official uniform which was a long white jacket, with a medal badge, the shape of a star on her left shoulder, on the badge there were words that said \u201cInter Dimensional Patrol\u201d, she also wore dark black pants and military boots that where white. Her blue hair was tied up in a bun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Sora said, he technically was on time, even though it was by only one minute, but he decided to just keep that between himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that everyone is here I\u2019ll explain the test.\u201d Instructor Sundy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe test is simple, each and ever last one of you is to attack me with everything that you have.\u201d Instructor Sundy said with a little smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood confused and a little scared. Sora was no different. This was a professional solider here, a solider that has fought countless Anti. \u201cThey didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d Sora thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not hold back, and keep in mind that only three people will pass. This test.\u201d Instructor Sundy said putting three fingers up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone let out a loud \u201cGASP!\u201d This couldn\u2019t be happening, there where 20 candidates right now and out of those 20 candidates only three would pass. Everyone started looking at one another with worried and selfish looks. It was everyone for themselves from this moment on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it is also possible that none of you will pass so keep that in mind as well, the rules are simple fist fight me at your full power.\u201d Instructor Sundy puts up one finger. \u201cSecond if you lose consciousness or give up you are disqualified.\u201d Instructor Sundy says putting up two fingers. \u201cAnd third if you fall off the edge of the platform you are also disqualified.\u201d Instructor Sundy puts up three fingers. \u201cSo keep that. In mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally she was going to throw us off the edge?\u201d Sora thought as he stared at the instructor in disbelief. They where on the 10th floor of the IDP building, a fall from this hight wouldn\u2019t kill anyone if they fell the right way, it would hurt, but not kill <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady let\u2019s begin.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sora, a girl with long blond hair tied into a ponytail, and a big muscular guy with no shirt, tan skin and long green hair that came down to his waist. Everyone else was either on the ground with a few bruises and a couple broken bones, covered in ice, or got throne off the platform and fell 10 stories off the IDP building and hit the ground hard. Ouch. This was the power of instructor Sundy. Sora didn\u2019t know what was scarier, the fact that instructor Sundy had beat up 17 of the cadets in less than a minute and a half, or the fact that she did all of this without breaking a sweat. Heck she wasn\u2019t even transformed into her true ice dragon form. Instructor Sundy had beaten up everyone with either physical force or her draconic ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this all that everyone could do, how disappointing..\u201d instructor Sundy said with a disappointed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora did not move, he could not even speak, Sora was just to afraid to do anything to instructor Sundy. What could he do with his meager power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now their looks to be only three candidates left. I hope you three provide me with a little more entertainment than the other candidates.\u201d Instructor Sundy said with a look that pretty much stated that she doubted that claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looked at the remaining cadets, and he saw that they were looking at him as well, and each other. Sora knew that they were doing the same thing he was doing, sizing up their options, and seeing if they stood a chance. Sadly for Sora he did not like his options to much. But Sora knew that one of them was  going to have to make a move soon , and that person was apparently the girl that stood in the middle of the two boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl jumps 10 feet into the air and her whole body starts to glow a bright gold color. When the glow begins to fade the girl stood a few feet behind Sora and the other cadet wearing golden armor that made her look like a goddess. Sora had never seen so much gold in his life. The girl wore a golden head band, with writing branded on it, writing that Sora did not understand, on her arms were two golden gauntlets that radiated power, on the girls chest rested a golden chest plate with the symbols of the sun in the middle, her shin guards were also gold and only came up to her knees, leaving the rest of her legs bare. The girls hair glowed with golden light and on her back rested a golden quiver with over a dozen arrows, and on her shoulder rested a golden bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEntrusting, very entrusting. So this is the armor of the High elf\u2019s I\u2019ve heard so much about. To think I would see it here. It truly is an amazing sight.\u201d Instructor Sundy said wearing a excited look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora had to agree with instructor Sundy the armor was truly amazing, but something seemed wrong. Sora looking at the girls face, noticed that she was wearing a look of pain. Was she injured? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyndis Bimaris.\u201d Instructor Sundy said looking at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a elf from the high forest, and not just any elf but a elf of royalty. You have a lot of talent, but it looks like you are not ready to bare the wait of that armor. It\u2019s power is to much for your body to handle.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora did not know anything about elf\u2019s, or elfin armor but he knew that what instructor Sundy said was the truth, as time passed the girl who\u2019s name was Lyndis Bimaris, seemed to be in even more pain. Sweat started to run down her forehead, and her breathing became more erratic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to fight me alone in that condition.\u201d Instructor Sundy said walking towards Lyndis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not alone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora walks next to Lyndis with determination shining brightly in his eyes. Lyndis looks at Sora with a surprised look, but still does not turn down his offer to help <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSora Silvertail, you are willing to stand with that girl in order to fight me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am!\u201d Sora yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora didn\u2019t know if both him and Lyndis could defeat instructor Sundy, but he wasn\u2019t going to let Lyndis fight all by her self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cadet with no shirt and long green hair says walking besides Lyndis and Sora. The more the merrier Sora thought as all three of them got ready to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk you little maggots bring it on!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sora looking at Instructor Sundy saw that she wasn\u2019t in a fighting stance, which every martial artist knew was the stance one gets in when they are ready to fight a opponent. Sora knew that instructor Sundy didn\u2019t see them as her opponents, how could she when she had beaten 17 other cadets with great ease. Instructor Sundy looked at the three cadets with nothing but a smile, as if she was excited beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk guys here\u2019s the plan.\u201d Lyndis says looking at Sora and the other cadet, who immediately turned their attention to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need you guys to distract her for a few minutes.\u201d Lyndis says looking at instructor Sundy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk i think we can do that, right?\u201d Sora asks looking at the other cadet, who shakes is head agreeing to the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what are you going to do?\u201d Sora asks looking at Lyndis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis armor is giving me a lot of power.\u201d Lyndis says closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can use that power to shoot one powerful arrow at her. But the down side is that I can only shoot one arrow, after that I\u2019ll be to exhausted to move.\u201d Lyndis says sweeting from the pain the armor was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou only have one shot?\u201d Sora asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyndis nods her head, saying no words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201d The unnamed cadet says stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe and Sora will distracted instructor Sundy, you get ready to fire your arrow, but hurry.\u201d The unnamed cadet says looking at Lyndis with his green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looks towards instructor Sundy, who was just standing still looking at them, with a small smirk on her face. Sora couldn\u2019t help but think how little instructor Sundy thought of them, since she was just letting them plan their plan of attack. Sora had heard the legends about instructor Sundy, like how she loved combat, battle excited her to no end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unnamed cadet puts both of his hands on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready.\u201d The cadet says in a series tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground without warning starts to rumble, and soon large vines start to shoot out of the ground at tremendous speeds, rushing towards instructor Sundy. Sora knew immediately that it was this cadet that was the cause of this strange phenomenon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my what is this?!\u201d Instructor Sundy says with a loud laugh. Sora could tell that she was really excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large vines where like a whip, as they attacked instructor Sundy with great speed and power. Instructor Sundy started to dodge and jump out of the way, avoiding the attacking vines with great skill. The vines assault did not not, they simply continued to chase after instructor Sundy like ravenous wolves, but even after all of this instructor Sundy continued to where a smile on her face, as if she was not worried at all of her current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so much fun, to think I would meet a Druid this far away from the forest.\u201d Instructor Sundy says looking at the mysterious cadet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looked at the unnamed cadet, he couldn\u2019t believe that he was looking at a actual Druid. Sora read about Druids in ancient scriptures. Druids where one of the oldest races to ever exist in the mythical realm, they where also protectors of nature it self. Druids where very powerful and where said to never leave the forest, so the question that plagued Sora\u2019s mind and even Lyndis mind was why was a Druid here trying to join the IDP, but those questions would have to wait for later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdam Timberwood, Druid of Mountain Crest Forest, you are truly an entrusting case, but this is not enough to beat me.\u201d Instructor Sundy says as she stand perfectly still as large plant vines move towards her, threatening to attack her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds for the gigantic vines to turn to pure glistening ice. The now frozen ice started to crack and break apart, no longer able to sustain its form any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that all you got!?\u201d Instructor Sundy yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Sora says appearing behind instructor Sundy, using the frozen vines as a distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora\u2019s hand started to burn with blue fire \ud83d\udd25. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFox fire!\u201d Sora yells as he shoots a ball of blue fire at instructor Sundy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom!\u201d A large explosion rocks the hole platform, and smoke fills the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, very impressive.\u201d Instructor Sundy says, appearing out of the smoke that soon dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looked at instructors Sundy completely shocked. Sora has used all of his power in that blast, and yet the instructor wasn\u2019t hurt at all, only her close where a little ruffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think that a Kitsune with no tails could be this powerful, it\u2019s probably because of that ancient blood coursing through those veins.\u201d Instructor Sundy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was taken back, instructor Sundy not only wasn\u2019t hurt, she even knew that he was a Kitsune, and what did she mean by ancient blood, was it possible that instructor Sundy knew more about Sora\u2019s past more than he did. Sora didn\u2019t have time to ask any questions though, instructor Sundy began her attack. Instructor Sundy threw a punch at Sora. Sora put his hands up to block the attack but as soon as the attack hit Sora went flying a few feet in the air. Instructor Sundy was to strong for Sora to block her attack head on, she was a dragon after all. Sora\u2019s arms where covered in ice, from instructor Sundy\u2019s earlier attack. Sora falls to the ground with a big thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora gets on his feet, with a little blood flowing from his mouth. Sora could barley feel his arms anymore, the ice was making them numb. Sora\u2019s fox fire didn\u2019t work but that didn\u2019t mean he was out of ideas. Kitsune\u2019s had a lot more to offer than Fox fire. Sora sprints towards instructor Sundy, with the full intent to attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Lyndis thinks as she looks at Sora charging towards Instructor Sundy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are going to attack me head on? Bring it on kid!\u201d Instructor Sundy says with a laughs, as she throws a punch at Sora as soon as he was close enough, a punch aimed at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstructors Sundy\u2019s fist goes through Sora\u2019s face and Sora\u2019s very appearance started to fade away like mist. The whole platform was soon field with countless people, people who were Sora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, now this really takes me back, it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve fought a illusion this powerful.\u201d Instructor Sundy says getting excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstructor Sundy was correct, Sora was using a illusion to create clones of himself. This illusion would not last long, and was made only to confuse the opponent, not for attacking. Sorta knew that instructor Sundy knew this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo bad this is only a illusion.\u201d Instructor Sundy raising her hands snaps her fingers, and in a few seconds the whole platform was covered in ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice covered Sora and Adams legs, and it was slowly making its way to their heads. The only thing that wasn\u2019t effected was Sora\u2019s clones, because they weren\u2019t real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is very easy to make this kind of illusion useless.\u201d Instructor Sundy says walking towards Sora and Adam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit.\u201d Sora says feeling angry with himself, his weakness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like this battle is over.\u201d Instructor Sundy says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right this battle is over.\u201d Adam says, confusing instructor Sundy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning large vines break out of the ice covered ground and cover instructor Sundy, making her unable to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready Lyndis?!\u201d Adam yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady!\u201d Lyndis says aiming her bow at instructor Sundy. The arrow inside the golden bow flowed with a earth shaking light, that made the wind surrounding Lyndis go wild like a small windstorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyndis fires the arrow at instructor Sundy, who was trapped. The arrow reminded Sora of a rocket as it flew towards instructor Sundy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!\u201d The explosion was huge. It didn\u2019t just shake the platform but the whole IDP building. The shock wave blew away both Sora, Adam, and Lyndis, knocking them off their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyndis armor soon disappears as she collapse to the ground, sweat running down her face, and gasping for air. An could not move, could barley see the opponent right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust filled the air, but the dust soon began to disappear, and what Sora saw was enough to make him collapse a hundred times over. Instructor Sundy was standing in the middle a huge crater, with her right arm completely transformed into a dragon arm, with light blue scales and, sharp claws that looked almost like icicles. Instructor Sora had preformed a partial transformation, which was a hard skill to learn. Instructor Sundy didn\u2019t have any wounds, or scratches, she looked perfectly fine, once again only her close where messed up, her jacket blown in pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing, nothing short of being amazing.\u201d Instructor Sundy said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t transformed I would have been in trouble.\u201d Instructor Sundy says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three cadets where out of options, what where they going to do? All they could do was watch as instructor Sundy walks over to them slowly, with a series expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you guys are ready because you guys...........\u201d instructor Sundy says with a huge pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPass!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three cadets look at Instructor Sundy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My powers are strong, but sometimes not strong enough.<br>\r\nEveryone has a certain trait that's stronger than the others.<br>\r\nSometimes, it's able to make calculated assumptions about a person's thoughts or emotions. Sometimes it's strength or speed.<br>\r\nFor me, it's instinct. I can sense danger. With over a hundred years of training, I've managed to perfect my danger instinct so I can pinpoint the almost exact place of the danger.<br>\r\nIt was on a cold, dark night. My magical cloaking shield that protects all mythical beings kept me hidden from view as I slithered around the town. I was small, only six feet long, but my fangs were poisonous, and I was strong and fast. Not as strong as a male, but strong enough.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, I stumbled across a gateway.<br>\r\nGateways feed off of magical powers to grow. My danger sense blared loudly and was muffled by the gateway's powers.<br>\r\nI was strong enough to resist the pull of the gateway, but half of my strength was gone. As I tried to pull away, the gateway seemed to tuck in, all the swirling cosmos of the dimensions sucked into a little rip. That wasn't good. It meant something was coming out.<br>\r\nThe gateway exploded, forcing three Anti out.<br>\r\nThe Anti looked like large, burly demons. Without my cloak, I was easily spotted. They were all larger than I was, and so I used the only thing that would be useful to me in this situation: Speed.<br>\r\nI turned and slithered away as fast as I could, which was about as fast as a normal human vehicle. The Anti grunted and gave chase.<br>\r\nI was fast, but the Anti were faster. Soon, they were so close I could almost hear them. I ran for the nearest tree and climbed, knowing by experience that the Anti were too heavy to climb trees.<br>\r\nThe Anti snarled at me as I climbed higher and higher. At last, I was so high that the branches swayed violently in the wind beneath me.<br>\r\nThe Anti could feel my fear. They drank it in, and began to climb the trunk.<br>\r\nIt was soon obvious that they could only go so far, so they stood on the thick branches and growled at me. I laughed back, spitting my venom in their faces. One of them got a shot in the eye, and howled as it ate away at it's body. The Anti crumbled to dust<br>\r\nOne of the Anti jumped and made a grab for me. His large hands grasped the branches of the trees and snapped them, making my branches shake.<br>\r\nThey jumped for me, grabbing for the branches I was on.<br>\r\nOne of them came so close that it grabbed my tail. I jerked forward and bit deeply into his arm. He let go and fell, also crumbling into fine, soft earth.<br>\r\nThe last Anti managed to pull enough branches away from me. I fell, and he grabbed me by the neck. By now I was far enough from the gateway that my magic had returned, but the presence of the Anti still carried enough of the gateway's essence that I couldn't cloak myself. I tried to bite the creature, but I couldn't reach him. He squeezed tightly, and I gasped for air.<br>\r\nThen his grip loosened, and I fell to the ground. The Anti was frozen in the air, arms spread wide, an arrow through his chest. The arrow fell with the remains of the Anti.<br>\r\nI cautiously examined the arrow. With my enhanced senses, I could tell that the tip of the arrow was doused with water from the first well, which legend said was holy and therefore could kill an Anti with a touch.<br>\r\n\"I'll need my arrow back.\"<br>\r\nI turned around, hissing. An Anthro female was behind me. Her long blond hair did little to hide her pointed ears, and her tight-fitting shirt displayed her large muscles quite easily. She stood at seven feet tall. I noticed talons on her ankles, which were poking out of her worn black boots. She would have been considered pretty if not for the fact that her eyes changed color at will and glowed in the dark.<br>\r\n\"You should be thankful,\" she said, calmly picking up the arrow and stuffing it back in her quiver.<br>\r\n\"I am,\" I muttered.<br>\r\n\"You know too much,\" the Anthro girl said. She was wearing sunglasses, which made her seem very intimidating. I reared to my full height, but that was still two feet shorter.<br>\r\n\"I also saw how you handled the Anti,\" she continued. \"Very few can do what you did and stay alive. I think the IDP could use someone like you.\"<br>\r\n\"IDP?\"<br>\r\n\"Inter Dimensional Patrol. We find the Anti and kill them. There are two jobs available at the moment: A hunter and a diver. The hunter tracks down the Anti that have passed through the gateway and kills them. The diver goes into the gateways and tries to figure the plans of the Anti. Both require skill, and you must pass a test first. Do you think you're up to the challenge?\" The Anthro extended her hand to me.<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"Lilith. And yours?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have a name?\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"No one ever gave me one,\" I admitted. Every part of me spoke of poverty,  from my long, tangled black hair to my sunken eyes.<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just call you Naga,\" Lilith decided. \"So, do you want to join?\"</span></div></div>",

Pretty soon the glow dies down as it does, you see his right arm is now draken, the spell worked \"It is done.\" Jin says  \"Now we wait for Drago to wake up and Donald to get here.\" You hear Donald clearing his throat and see that Donald and the Dragon King is back. Kiba says \"How did it go?\" and the Dragon King says \"I know the old ways had been hard, but we managed to come to an agreement as long as we keep it a secret like your organazation, things will change.\" \"Not the answer I was expecting, Prince Blaze says \"But it's a start.\" Donald puts his armor back on looking at Drago \"I see he's doing better, now we have to wait for him to wake up and we'll return to IDP.\" Dragon King says \"In the meantime, I'm going to put up a secret army to battle the Black demon's, Captain Blackmane can you put an army together?\" Blackmane says \"I'll sure try, Del Toro.

Drago just says nothing but the demon takes this oppurtunity and slashes at Drago leaving a large tear across his chest guard.He snaps out of it.He whips his tail at Drago only to be blocked by his spear as he grabs it with his tail throwing it away. \"Come on Drago, don't get distracted.\" Jai says.

He gives Drago a dirty punch to the gut. \"Ooh, a sucker punch. Not good.\" says Donald.

The screen faded as another memory loaded. Age:Fourteen.You saw Drago standing on a cliff. \"I remember this.\" Sven said. You watched as he nervously looked over to a younger Red and Sven who smiled and said \"You can do this.\" He ran and leaped off the cliff. Drago's wings opened and for the first time he flew. Age:Seventeen. He graduated college that day and signed up for a career in the military.It then changed to later in the year. He was patrolling a village where many residents were being executed for counts of conspiracy many houses were being burned down. \"Kaiser,\" your Sergent called.\"Yes Sir.: he replied instantly. \"Come here.\" he said. He followed him into a large house.There was a ladder leading to the attic. \"Check up there.\" he said.  \"Affirmative.\" he replied climbing the ladder. Once up there you saw about thirty children and about half as many adults. They looked at him. \"Kaiser, is there anything up there?\" his Sergent called. They stared at him, he saw in the low light fear in their eyes awaiting your response. \"Nothing here sir,\" you called down \"all empty.\" He climbed down the ladder and his squad left. The memory changed to a firefight between Drago's patrol unit and enemies. The three other members of his squad and Drago was captured and made Prisoners of War.In the prison it was horrible. He was made wear a steel muzzle to prevent breathing fire. They never removed it so he couldn't eat so he was pretty much starved. Eventually his team was freed. He immediately returned home as he was gone for nine months.He was told to get to the hospital. The view changed to him entering a hospital room. A female dragon lying in the bed crying out in agony. She looked at him suprised. Eventually everything was over and the doctor handed the baby to him and said heres your son. You and the others looked at him and smiled.</span></div></div>",

A few days later. He is walking home late at night when he noticed that someone was following him. After reaching a clearing between buildings he turned around to confront this person. He is hooded. He ran at him unsheathing two daggers. He fought with him but he jammed the first dagger into Drago's leg and put the other one straight through his heart. He ran away leaving him to die. Everything around him froze. A creature shrowded in darkness aproached his dying body. \"You want revenge, dont you?\" he asked. He nodded. \"Very well Kaiser, follow me.\" he said as a black portal opened behind him. He staggered after him as he walked through. The memory changed to the next day. His uncle walked through the street surrounded by guards, he watched from the rooftops. The two daggers in hand.He looked at his daggers they were as sharp as they were in that memory. He followed his uncle until there were many people to watch him die.You walked off the edge of the building and approached him.<br>\r\nHe called him and he froze as he heard his voice. Drago knew he was the one who ordered the assassin to kill him. \"I challenge you to a duel.\" he said. He agreed, a foolish mistake. You both fought with swords. After knocking his sword away, Drago dropped his sword and stabbed him with the daggers. Drago walked away leaving him to die. As he walked into an alley way. The creature appeared again. \"You got your revenge,\" he said, \"now do I have your alleigance?\" \"Yes Phantom.\" Drago replied. The memory changed to Drago and three others on one knee with a sword infront of each of him. As Phantom entered he ordered each of you to stand. \"Rise Necro, Shade, Kaiser, Negative.You four have proven yourselves to be my best students.\" The memory changed to Drago and the others you were badly wounded and they were trying to help. \"Leave him,\" Phantom ordered, \"he`s served his purpose.\" As Negative stood up he attached a small explosive device to him. <i>Could it be?

Care to try it out?\" He leads me to a little room where 5 logs are standing. \"Just swing and let the axe work it's magic.\" I shrugged and swung the axe facing the logs, I can almost feel a wave of energy coming from it hitting all 5 logs splitting them. \"Wow.\" I said \"That's called the sonic chop.\" He says, I said, \"This will drain Hazama from his power?\"  Unturth nods \"Remember, your just back-up. Just in case.\" I nod and thought, <i>Come on Lord Charger, make Necros remember like you made Molly remember.</i>  Unturth says \"Let's see how your friends are doing?\" I went with him back to the office with the viewing crystals and paid attention to the battle with Necros and I noticed fhat</span></div></div>",

Msituas body began to pull itself back together when Korisama said \"He should be weak enough to be killed now, if we hurry\" \"YOU CAN\u2019T KILL ME\" Msitua said.  Korisama launched an icicle at him which caused him to stumble backwards but he didnt fall \"PATHETIC\" Msitua yelled and then with all of his strength Drago leapt at him and with his legs he forced him to fall backwards and he was decapitated by the upward facing sword that was behind him. \"Famous last words\" Drago said as he watched his head separate from his body.<br>\r\nNext?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fires burned in the void impossibly, damned beings from a million devoured worlds and beyond howled before their oblivion, and visible energy ran and poured like water. Antis roared and fought in the ever-shifting recesses and grottos between   the bones of planets long gone; immense shards or rock and raw matter, spinning and dancing over an abyss of raw power . The primal might of this sea of pain, of every angry thought, every feeling of hurt and rage heaved and spouted up, pouring up towards massive free-floating spear of obsidian. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the recess of the structure, once a decent sized continent on some obscure, forgotten planet, you looked out a window at the domain and know satisfaction. You revelled in the crackle of fire and the despairing howls of those dragged here from other places. This was your kingdom; everything and everything in it was yours. And soon, so would be everything beyond. You leaned out and glanced downwards, surveying the upward rise of the gargantuan tendril of liquid hate. It had almost reached the shard of rock you perched on; soon it would envelope the stone, and the raw power would be used to force space and time apart, and than you would step through to the next collective victim of the Antis.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Retiring from the window, you headed to the main chamber, where the crude teleporter awaited. Other Antis sensed you and scrambled to flee, pressing against each other and into the slightest depression in the crude rock walls desperately. You ignored them for the most part, idly popping one into your mouth as something to tide you over on the journey. With your incredible speed, the miles of twisting passages pass quickly, and soon you leap into the main transmission chamber. A cylindrical metal tower of various alloys stitched and wired together, crackling with electricity, plasma, pain,and other fuels, dominated the room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Previously the amount of raw anger needed to establish a navigable link between universes was extreme, and could only be opened occasionally. Now, you reflected impatiently, waiting for the power to build sufficiently, with increasing amounts of advanced technology being looted from taken systems, it was becoming easier and easier to send Antis to other realms. Which increased the speed of their downfall. Which increased the rate at which Antis could be spawned and dispatched to still more universes. Perhaps, one day, the conquests of the Antis would expand at an infinite speed, taking all before them and consigning it to darkness for ever. It could only be hoped. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A chill in the air and an inexplicable feeling of indignation heralds the arrival of your so-called Head of League Brunliaye. <i>Well, child, are you ready for your first day-trip?</i> He rumbled in your mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i> I spawned ready.</i> You reply, resting the urge to leap on the older Anti and tear it apart, just to prove that you're the stronger. With difficulty, you reign in the tempting prospect. Soon. <i>Remember, you are to go to the human world and reinforce the portal from that side, allowing our greater force to make the transition. You'll have one squad with you, other than that, you're on you're own. Do not dare to die until you've completed you work.<i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>We've been over this a million times before, 'sir'. I know what's available, and I know how to get this job done. This world <b>will</b> fall.</i> Outside, the tidal wave of terror surges up the sides of the 'building', infusing those within with it's ectatically wicked power. The teleporter blazes with black light, forcibly gnawing it's way from hell to earth, and you step through the tunnel, feeling the eyes of Brunliaye stabbing you from a million miles away as you emerge into    <br>\r\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

Like the anthros, most feralli have physical capabilities beyond that of humans, though they differ between the feralli depending on what animal they are related to.  Unlike anthros, feralli have three distinct forms they can take.  The first of these is the previously mentioned natural form.  Most mammals have a tail, reptiles tend to have oddly colored or shaped eyes, and flying creatures tend to display wings.  These can be disguised by similar technology to that which allows anthros to blend in, though in many cases it isn't needed.  The second form the feralli can take is their anthro form.  In this their physical attributes are amplified to match those of anthros, and they look like a normal anthro, making it easy for them to blend in in the anthro dimension.  Their final form is their animal form.  This form allows the feralli to take on the full animal form that they are related too.  This is useful for disguise purposes, as well as giving further changes in size and physical capabilities.  Now the only question is what kind of feralli are you?</span></div></div>",

The IDP has a lot of different jobs to fill and we have to make sure you don't get put somewhere you won't work out.\"  The proctors spoke through a speaker system connected to the testing rooms.  \"The first test is the obstacle course.  Remember that there are portions of the test that we don't tell you about.  When the light turns green you can start.\"  I scanned the room quickly.  There seemed to be several paths to take that would lead to the finish, which was clearly a door to another room.  I picked that path seemed to focus on agility and readied myself, picturing the path I would take.  The light flashed green, and within a quarter of a second I was moving.  The first obstacle was a wall.  I ignored the rope hanging down it, instead shifting forms as I sprinted toward the wall.  I fully reached my anthro form about 5 yards from the wall and leapt.  I easily landed on the top of the wall, balancing there to quickly scan the next portion of the course.  Seeing that it was clearly a speed test I leapt forward towards the next part of the course, shifting forms again in midair.  I landed on all fours, using the superior running speed and smaller body size of my animal form to dash under, over, around, and through the many pipes that riddled the course in front of me.  Reaching the end I shifted back to my human form for the final part of the test.  A group of three heavy doors, clearly designed to be lifted barred my path.  Rather than walls on either side of the doors though, there was empty space and a significant fall.  I ignored the doors and focused instead on the frames, sprinting toward the first at an angle.  I then jumped out over the edge, reaching for the frame with both hands and spinning myself back onto the course.  I used the same method for the other two doors, zigzagging my path across them.  I sprinted the last distance to the door and slapped the button that was the finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  Please go through the door to the next testing room.\"  I do as I am told, panting slightly and trying to catch my breath.  My bright red tail swishes back and forth, betraying my pleasure at the quality of the run.  The next room is simple.  It contains a few weight sets and a normal length track (meaning 1 lap is 1/4 mile).  A bear anthro stands in the room with a notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to help with this part of the test.  I'm supposed to spot you.  We're going to test two things here; 1 is how much can you lift in your various forms, and 2 is how fast you can run in your various forms.  We'll start with weight and human form.\"  He gestures to a bench press machine.  I lay down and adjust the weight.  I know I'm fairly strong, but nothing like what the bear anthro could do.  I set the weight to 200 lbs, and push out 1 rep.  The bear increases the weight by 10 lbs and I go again.  At 240 lbs I'm unable to lift the bar, and the bear lifts the bar without paying attention to it and sets if back into its position. \"Max bench press: 230.\"  I'm not unhappy with considering it's about about 40 lbs over my body weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next up is the 40 yard dash and 100 meter dash.\"  I grin as a set up on the track.  Speed is my strong suit, only outclassed by my balance and agility.  He tells me to get into the starting position, and as the crack sounds to start I sprint with all my might.  \"Time for the 40 yard dash; 4.58 seconds.\"  I smile knowing that only a few elite runners can match this.  I set up again, readying for the 100 meter dash.  Again, the crack of the starting gun sounds and I sprint for all I'm worth.  \"Time for the 100 yard dash: 9.79 seconds.\"  I stand tall, realizing that my time is only a single tenth of a second short of the world record.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Anthro form now please.\"  The tests are repeated after a 10 minute break.  My bench press raised another 30 pounds to 260.  My 40 yard dash dropped by more than half a second, to 3.97, and my hundred yard dash dropped even further, to 9 seconds exactly.  \"Results for Velox Celer have been sent ahead.  Please head through that door.\"</span></div></div>",

Inside was a man sitting at a table, and he had a tablet in front of him, scrolling through lists of data.  As the door slid shut behind Velox, the man looked up.  \"Please have a seat.\"  I sit in the only available chair, across the table from the man.  \"I'm Hank Clayton, the person who will be assigning you a position.\"  He looked down at the tablet and continued, \"Velox is it?\" He looked back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very close, sir,\" I answered.  \"The e is a long e and the o has an awe sound, so it's Vee-lawcks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.  I apologize.  I continuously have difficulty determining how to pronounce the names of other races.  Anyway, you did extremely well, even compared to others of your specific type.  You are a swift fox feralli, I believe?\"  Velox nods in agreement, preferring not to speak until directly asked.  \"Your strength was above average for your type, though nothing amazing.  Your speed on the other hand was quite impressive.  Previous dexterity, agility, and balance tests have also proven that it's nearly impossible to make you fall too.  The only thing we didn't test personally was your endurance, but because we have official records of you winning marathons we decided that was unnecessary.  Do you have anything else to add.\"  I shook my head no, to worried that my voice might give away my excitement.  Hank continued, \"Then I suppose there's not much else to say.  You're clever in your use of forms and paths you take, and clearly physically capable.  We'd like to put you on an infiltrator squad.  It will likely be a three man team with some other-dimensional races.  We'll contact you for your introduction within a few days.\"  Hank laid the tablet on the table and stood.  I followed his lead and shook his hand when he reached out.  After that I left, heading for home.</span></div></div>",

You sit in the remaining chair, and anybody not aware of what the IDP really did would have thought that the room consisted of four normal people.  As it turned out, the man you had already met, Hank, was the only human in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those of you who use it, please deactivate or remove any camouflage technology,\" Hank said.  You reach to what appeared to be a dial watch on your right wrist, and pulled the dial setter three times.  The technology actually used rippling of space to create an unreachable pocket of space to hide feralli's tails where they wouldn't be felt like they would if they were just cloaked.  When you look up, one of the other members has deactivated their disguise as well.  Across the table sits a blue gelli.  The semi transparent blue being looked completely normal except for the coloration of its body.  \"Now that we are all what we appear to be we will give introductions.  You each know me already.

This is a difficult and dangerous type of infiltration unit as it often entails you either assaulting small bases on your own, or infiltrating and sabotaging outposts so that full assault groups can come in without any particular difficulty.  None of you have worked in any field groups for IDP before, and one of you has never worked with IDP at all.\"  You give yourself away as you tuck your tail under your chair slightly, even though Hank didn't even glance at you.  \"Because of this you will go through some serious training before your group goes active.\"</span></div></div>",

You then lowered the barrier &amp; ran at him as you knocked the aussult rifles out of his hands &amp; held him against the desktop with Railgun aimed at his head. \"I-I-I thought I killed you,\" Wrex said fearfully. \"Dark spirits come back sometimes,\" you stated, \"Its a tendency.\" \"W-w-what are you going to do to me?\" he asked. \"I just wanted to see what you are doing,\" you said, \"But its obvious that you are doing crime. Its not in me to kill something though.\" \"What are you going to do?\" he asked calmed. \"Slow you,\" you said as you kicked him in a place that hurts twice in succession. \"Ow, you bastard,\" he said in pain.

You arrived at the door to the hall to the executive rooms.  \u201cWelcome, please state your name,\u201d the automated door lock said monotonously. \u201cJai Aqua,\u201d you stated. \u201cAccess granted,\u201d the lock said. The veteran officers around you murmured in shock to this. You opened the door and went down the hall to see 20 or 30 rooms. You found EX 10 and went inside. The room looked business class and had a computer, a widescreen TV as well as lots of other luxuries. You just shrugged and went to the bedroom and saw a bed that looked big enough even for you. You smiled as you looked around. Books, DVD\u2019s and lots of other stuff. \u201cNow this is unfair,\u201d you muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just went back into the main room and into the kitchen. It looked like a professional chefs kitchen. \u201cUmmm this is getting creepy,\u201d you said. You opened the fridge and saw tons of gourmet cold goods in there. \u201cWoah\u2026 at least they have good food,\u201d you laughed to yourself. You grabbed out some sliced seasoned roast beef and found some bread and just made 2 beef sandwiches. You went into the living room and sat down. You turned on the TV and saw that all the channels were down. <i>Broadcasting network must be down</i>, you thought. You ate your sandwiches and just stood up and went over to the computer. You turned it on and noticed IDP had set up an emergency broadcast network for people to request help on. You noticed tons of requests mostly regarding funding for stuff like a place to stay or to get out of town as well as a lot of other stuff. You scrolled and noticed one in particular. It was one from a Cheryl Mason requesting help to find his son, Donald.<i> Could that be our Donald and that\u2019s his mum?</i> you thought. You then closed the computer off and thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

When I used spirit perception it couldn\u2019t find any pure energy source to draw from so it started to steal  light from your eyes. We are fortunate that I didn\u2018t go any further or else you would have been blind.\u201d At this you grip your arm where the mark was. \u201cThis mark, is pure evil.\u201d You think \u201cI need to find Phantom and make him remove it.\u201d \u201cThere how is that.\u201d Jin asks. You open your eye and see your vision is normal. \u201cThank you Jin, I can see now.\u201d You reply as you stand up. \u201cNow that you have wasted enough time we should go now.\u201d Msitua says. \u201cJust because you need the crystals doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re letting you tag along.\u201d Tsubaki says. \u201cOh but in fact you must.\u201d Mistua says as he pulls a crystal from his robe \u201cI have this crystal and I will not part from it, so you have to let me come with you.\u201d Everyone stairs at him knowing that he was right with that. \u201cWell nothing we can do.\u201d Drago says \u201cEveryone let\u2019s move out!\u201d Everyone agrees and you all start to move. \u201cKorisama did you gather anything?\u201d you think. \u201cYes I have and\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Phantom stood up onto a platform in the middle of the courtyard and said \"Today, we may rejoice, our brother has found his way from the light, and has returned to us!\" There was a cheer from those in the courtyard. They continued on through the fort, every time they came upon an apprentice, said apprentice would bow, in Phantoms presence. They arrived at a room, that appeared to be a war room, the main table had multiple plans and maps on it, each map was of a major city in each of the mainstream dimensions.<br>\r\n\"Take a look and tell me what you think?\" Phantom said. Drago place both arms on the table and began studying the tactics. \"This looks good, you catch them off guard, and it could be over in a matter of days\" Drago said.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door was forced open, and Negative walked in and looked at Drago, he then took out his sword and put the tip of it to Dragos throat. \"Whats he doing here?\" Negative said angrily\". \"Its nice to see you to\" Drago said sarcastically.<br>\r\nPhantom said \"He has come to his senses and has rejoined our cause\". Negative sheathed his blade and said \"So be it\" then left the room. Phantom then looks at Drago and says...</span></div></div>",

Drago left the room and headed in the direction of the forge, along the way he saw an arch with an inscription, that said \"In Antiscius,  Convenit Conperio Otium\". Drago arrived at the forge, there he saw Vizere, he was a tall, slender looking Satyr, who wore black armor, probably of his own craftsmanship.<br>\r\n\"Vizere, I presume?\" Drago said. The satyr looked at him \"Who wants to know?\". Drago said \"I mean you no bother, noble smith, my name is Kaiser Cesary, Lord Phantom, told me to come and meet you, he mentioned you have some equipment for me\" \"Ah so you are the one all the commotion is about. Its nice to finally set eyes on you, come follow me, your equipment is over here\" Vizere replied.<br>\r\nThey arrived at a mannequin that had a set of armor on it. Vizere said \"First of all, we should get that excuse of armor off of you\" Vizere laid his hand on Kaisers chest and his IDP armor vanished. Kaiser then put on his new armor. He first attached the ebony coloured cuisse. Then he put his feet into the pair of clawed boots. He buckled the chest plate,there was no protection for his body, from the waist up to his chest, due to the armors placement. He attached a two pronged gauntlet to his left forearm. A spined manica was made for his right arm.He strapped the helmet to the upper area of his face [upper jaw to back of head] it had a visor. Finally there was a hood on the back of the chest plate that he pulled over his head.<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Kaiser asked. Vizere chuckled \"Its nice to finally see my master piece being put to use, and dont forget your weapon\" Vizere handed Kaiser a bow, and three arrows. \"That bow required the height of my smithing expertise, put it to good use\". Kaiser nodded and slung the bow over his head and let it rest on his right shoulder, he placed the three arrows into three slots that where on the back of the left shoulder area of the chest plate.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(This story is actually an idea I had for a Video Game. I hope you like it.)<br>\r\nIntroduction<br>\r\nWelcome to Gate City.<br>\r\nIt is your typical Metropolis with tall buildings, busy shopping plazas, and lots of people. However this city holds a huge secret. Long ago this city was a part of a huge inter dimensional research project nicknamed The Gate Project. The Gate project allowed people to travel to many dimensions. The project was successful and Gate City was the center of inter dimensional activity. But one day someone had opened a portal to a very dangerous dimension and unleashed terrible monsters called Antis. This forced the researchers  to pull the plug on the Gate Project and they wiped everyone\u2019s memory to make it as if it never happened. However despite the most of the portals being removed ripples in space keep some of these gateways open. The Gate researchers knew that some portals could not be closed and that they could not keep things from getting though so they started a secret group of individuals called the Inter dimensional Patrol (IDP for short) to eliminate monsters and keep the peace. Years later things seem rather normal but a ripple is starting to form and more monsters are beginning to leak though. With the a new threat approaching the IDP needs someone who can help them stand up to this and that someone is you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the role of a human(or some other Dimensional being) that gets tangled into this mess and then is called to help the IDP battle the Antis and help figure out what is going on with the ripple, or you can become the enemy of the IDP and try to dominate the world your choice. There are many races you can become. Here are some examples.<br>\r\nHuman: A person from the normal dimension or the parallel dimension. Despite the fact that most had there memories wiped many are aware of  portals that are in the city. The Gate researchers are capable of giving Humans Super powers.<br>\r\nAnthro: A Half Human Half Animal being from the Were Dimension. Despite there terrifying appearance most Anthros are peaceful and a good number of anthros actually live in the normal dimension thanks to special cloaking devices. Anthros are capable of Superhuman strength, speed, and senses.<br>\r\nMyth: Myths (short for Mythical) are unique creatures that live in a Dimension called the Fantasy Realm. Some examples of Myths Include Dragons, Kitsuns, Pegasus, and centaurs. Myths a able to use special mystical powers that normal people can\u2019t do.<br>\r\nAnti: Antis are evil monsters from the Negative Dimension. Antis are created by negative emotions from Humans and Creatures from all dimensions and they feed of  negative aura to grow stronger. Antis use the power of true evil to destroy everything that stands in their way.<br>\r\nWhat side will you chose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may take the story in any way you want, but I do have a few small rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: When you make your character please leave an option for a new character.<br>\r\n2: You may make your own Race and Dimension if you want. <br>\r\n3: You can have crossovers from Anime, Video Games, and TV. <br>\r\n4: No sexual content.<br>\r\n5: [Edit] Vore is now alowed but keep it 13+ please.<br>\r\n6: I will accept mild swearing, but if a chapter goes to far it will be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add and have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: I would like to give a big thank you to my friends for helping me make this story so Awsome.<br>\r\n<span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'unleashmaximum', '', '', '', '10', '', 'OFF', '100814819');
