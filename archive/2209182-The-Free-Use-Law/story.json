No Student below the age of 15 (meaning below 3rd year) may participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool uniforms for witches are to be at the most consisting of a corset in their house colours to push up their breasts, a thong, black stockings and high heels or bare legs with knee high black high-heeled boots. At the very least the witch is to be nude if they prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale students are no longer allowed to play Quidditch but can now perform as cheerleaders to encourage their teams, to congratulate them on victories, console them on defeats and to reward or console the opposing team for victories or defeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo students are allowed birth control and are expected to be at least with child by one month by the end of the school year. The school nurse will perform repeat check up to ensure contraception is not used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasswords to enter another house's dormitory are no longer necessary nor are the spells to prevent boys from entering the girls rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitches are to be ready and willing at all times for a wizard to use them. At the end of each week, witches are to bring memories of their weekly exploits to prove that they are abiding by the rules. If a witch fails to provide proof of at least 7 acts A DAY, then their head of house can decide on an appropriate punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the year, should Educational Decree No. 69 prove successful in Hogwarts then it will be introduced to the magical world at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Decree was signed and permitted by <b>Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic of Great Britain.</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does the story begin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N: for the record students start Hogwarts at 13 rather than 11, so 5th years are 17. Also witches do not age physically passed 25 and retain their sexy figures even with multiple child births.</span></div></div>",

In Recent years this number has increased due to the actions of the previous administration (led by the now-imprisoned Donald J. Trump) and their law banning sexual activity between Superhumans, regardless of their alignment.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>The combat this, my administration is enacting the Superhuman Free Use Act.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>The Superhuman Free Use Act allows the free and unrestrained sexual activity between the Superhuman community through the use of a series of three licences which grant different benefits to the holder. Applicants must be 18 years or older to apply.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Master's Licence: The Master's Licence allows the holder to command anyone holding a lesser licence to do any sexual act they desire. If a Master Villain commands a Slave Hero to allow all of the villain's Henchmen/women to fuck them in any way they desire then the Hero is encouraged to do so.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Slave's Licence: The Slave Licence allows the holder to submit to any sexual act that they are commanded to do by holders of the Master's Licence. When a Slave Hero imprisons a Master Villain, the slave is encouraged to visit the Master and service him or her and any of their Henchmen/women if the have any in the prison.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Switch Licence: The Switch Licence grants the benefits of both Master and Slave Licences, however a Switch cannot command a Master only a Slave<br>\r\nPublic Officials (i.e. Police, Politicians, Teachers, Doctors, Paramedics, Doctors etc...) are allowed to apply for whichever licence they wish and can have all the benefits of that licence. Slaves are encouraged to service Public officials to boost morale.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If a Hero or Villain wishes to apply for a licence, then they must reveal their true identity to the public. In the event that the Hero or Villain does not remember their true name (via amnesia or other reasons) then they can give an alias and they will be known by that name on all official paper work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Licence holders are to consent to be followed 24/7 by LexCorp nano-cameras to record all activity and the footage is to be sold online. Any money made will be used to boost the individuals City economy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All Female applicants are to consent the implantation of contraceptive devices to prevent pregnancy. In the event that a pregnancy is desired then the Master is the relationship can apply for the right to disable the device. In the event of the occurrence of a pregnancy, then the parties must marry in a legal ceremony and both parents are encouraged to care for the resulting child in whatever way they desire.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Any who perform acts of heroism or villainy without being licence holders, are to be branded Vigilantes and Terrorists and are to be punished to the full extent of the law with none of the benefits of the Act.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Signed: Alexander J.

The Joker has been apprehended and he and Batwoman are now en-route to Arkham Island. Lucky Bitch.</i>\" the female dispatch finished in a not-so-quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Batmobile swerved through the busy Gotham streets as it drove quickly towards Arkham Asylum. Inside the vehicle was the infamous Dark Angel of Gotham known as Batwoman or Helena Wayne, however she was not in the drivers seat. No, the person in the Driver's seat was the Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime. Currently he had one hand on the wheel while the other was on the back of Helena's head as the Dark Angel bobbed up and down as she eagerly deep throated the clown's huge 14 inch cock. Her wrists were handcuffed behind her back with her own cuffs and her naked pussy was dripping over the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she felt the large white cock begin to pulse and throb in her skilled mouth, before the Joker fired a massive load down Batwoman's throat just as they pulled up at Arkham.</span></div></div>",
