If you want food, come back here when we're open and with money!\" you shout, reaching out. The fat figure howls and to your shock, bites you on your arm. \"OW!!!\" you shout, shaking. The fat figure howls again and runs off...or rather waddles off. The pain really stings, and you go to soak your bite wound under running water. You look to see the amount of food eaten was vast..your boss is not going to be happy.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** **************************<br>\r\nYou were right...your boss found out and fired you. You just growl and head to your bathroom, brushing your teeth. You banduaged up where the fat guy bit you. Suddenly, your stomach begins to growl...you are hungry...very hunger. You groan and hold your stomach...the hunger soon making you pass out.<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ************************<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh...your head hurts as you awaken.

Sighing, you searched on the local news sites...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and found nothing to match. Certainly, there was no news to be had of a fat, feral fiend. Shrugging, you sent off a handful of applications for something, anything, that would accept you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just imagine how the interview would go: '<i>For what reason were you removed from your last job?'

You notice that the house is deserted, and quickly remember that you family went to visit your grandma for the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...no one was here to see me last night...\" you think to yourself, trying to think of anyone else who might have seen you last night. You quickly realize that maybe your best friend, Kyle who lives next door might have noticed something! You race out of your house and over to Kyle's to inquire about your whereabouts the previous night. You knock on the door and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, (IYNH)! What's up?\" Kyle says as he answers the door wearing nothing but his usual baggy shorts. Kyle was always the messier of the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kyle,\" you say as you follow him inside. \"I was actually wondering if you noticed anything weird last night... Has anything strange happened lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you, puzzled. <br>\r\n\"Well not really... Dad said something got into the trash out on the curb last night... Probably just a stray dog or something. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing I just....well....\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what? What're you trying to say?\" Kyle asks as he messes with some papers on the counter, dropping one on accident. \"Oops...\" As Kyle bends down to pick it up, his big baggy shorts fall down enough that you see his ass. All at once the room spins a little and you feel yourself loosing rational thought. You begin to feel your body expand as well. Your belly sags down over your thighs and your flat chest develops into two huge sacks of flesh. Your butt grows big enough to break most chairs. You only have one instinct at this moment. Before Kyle even has time to witness what his best friend has become, you lean forward and bite him hard on the right butt cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww!!! Hey, (IYNH)!!! What the?!\" He can't even finish his sentence before he too begins to change. You watch as your best friend becomes a mirror image of your own bloated body.

You throw open the pantry door and begin to tear boxes apart, trying to get the tasty prizes inside into your fat mouth. Kyle waddles over to the fridge and begins to pull everything out and down it in instants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you devour the food, your were-fatso bodies begin to swell up with massive amounts of fat. While you're both gaining about a pound per thing that you consume, you're filling out in much different ways. Your fat is pooling in your huge expanding belly, it grows ever farther down your legs, swellling out wider and wider as well. On top of that your meaty moobs are beginning to fill with pound upon pound of fat. Kyle is growing similarly, only his moobs are not growing at quite the same rate as yours. Instead, his ass is beginning to sag more and more as he gets bigger and bigger. Soon you each reach for the next morsel of food only to find that there is nothing left!

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">One night, you're working at your job, about to close shop when you find a fat person stuffing their face of free food. But when you try to stop them, they bite you and waddle away! The next night, you're brushing your teeth when your stomach growls and you pass out...the next morning, you find yourself in shattered clothes, covered in gobs of food. Now every full moon (Both the natural and your own), you will transform into a were-fatso!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: A person is cursed when they're bitten or licked by a were-fatso. You change every time you see a full moon, either the one in the sky or a fully exposed butt.<br>\r\n2: All the calories you devour only affect your were-fatso form, not your normal one. You become your normal size, but when you change into a were-fatso, you become the size you were there currently.<br>\r\n3: A were-fatso is driven away by health food and tofu.<br>\r\n4: Leave the main character's gender be amquitous (IE don't state if its a guy or a girl). This makes it more fair for everyone<br>\r\n</td>",
