You've got the normal grey fur, are of about average height, weight, and build, and not exceptionally skilled at any particular job, although you are also quick to point out that you aren't particularly <i>bad</i> at any given job either. You are considered pretty bright however, so that's something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, you go out for a walk, and wind up pretty far from the village. Although the Jungle can be dangerous at times, you are fairly confident that you won't run into anything you can't handle. After all, despite the distance involved, this is still a fairly well traveled part of the jungle, and you can't remember anyone warning you about dangerous creatures living around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are walking along a trail near a small stream, you stop to rest for a minute. Suddenly, a lightning bolt cracks down through the treetops and strikes you dead on. Although the pain is excruciating, everything quickly goes white and you black out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you can immediately tell that something is wrong, even without opening your eyes. Although you aren't feeling any residual pain from the lightning strike, your body parts are giving you all sorts of contradictory feelings. You've heard one of the other tribesmen say that lightning strikes can do funny things to a person's head, so maybe that's what this is? You open your eyes slowly, and look around. You can hardly believe what you're seeing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScattered all around you are body parts. Very <i>familiar</i> body parts. <i>Your</i> body parts. You gape. You've literally been blown to pieces! As far as you can tell, you've been divided into six parts. Your head, your body, your arms, and your legs. Thankfully, your body parts still appear to be clothed (you were wearing typical tribal garb). But what are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

You still had your sense of control, why not try moving it? \"Hmmm...let me see If I could do this?\" You try to see if you could make minor movements first, it didn't take you long enough to see your right arm wiggling it's fingers, then your other limbs followed by your torso which was twitching. Now for the major movements you saw your right arm rising and waving at you followed by your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all those practices out of the way you attempt to assemble yourself now, you move both of your arms and scurry towards your disembodied torso. You first attach your right arm on the empty stump, upon attaching the severed limb you could feel a slight tingling sensation from afar. You swing your right arm around to see if it stays in place and it looks like it didn't come off. You grab your other arm and attach it in the same manner \"Alright...looking good\" you said afterwards you used both of your arms to push against the ground lifting your disembodied torso then started walking towards your pair of legs. You attach both of your legs and soon you were whole again...well ALMOST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body started to walk towards your head and picks you up. You were curious at first and examined your body from bird's eye view \"This is so weird...did that lightning do this to me?\" you asked yourself then placed your head back on your neck where it belongs. Good as new, there were no scars around you body and it looks like you were never broke. You took a moment to stretch for a while before you could proceed back to your village, however you tripped on a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" you shout in pain as you fell back to the ground and were scattered in pieces again. You groaned in pain and noticed that you weren't completely whole and that you could still disassemble yourself. A few moments later you assemble yourself and proceeded to go back to the village, but before you could  you hear a sound in the bushes.</span></div></div>",

And to demonstrate, you remove the tribal mother\u2019s head, holding her back as Silver\u2019s body runs at her body with a spear, running her right through the heart. The council and tribal mother gasps, but are even more shocked to find no blood being drawn. Pulling the spear out, the tribal mother rubs the wound, finding a small, furry hole where it impaled her, which is easily pinched closed. With this demonstration of a \u201cmodular\u2019s\u201d abilities, the tribal mother and council agree it would be best if the whole tribe were decapitated by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later at the circle, with all of the members of your tribe sitting in a wide circle around a fire, you and Silver begin walking around, removing each head from your three dozen or so tribe members. The heads are set a bit closer to the fire on pre-built pedestals, the tribe mother speaking a long prayer to the stars as you do so. Once all the heads are removed, the tribal mother utters something you hoped you\u2019d hear.<br>\r\n\u201cFrom this day on, your bodies are not your own, they are everyone\u2019s, for the good of the tribe.

He was one of the more physically-strong members of your tribe, and often went to look for food for everyone as a hunter. In his hand is a spear, which he drops in shock. His face is frozen with utter horror, soon meeting your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-help! Silver, help me!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, Felix? You're...You're alive!?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, somehow. I...I was, uh, t-taking a walk, then, a lightning bolt, blacked out, then, this!\" you say, panic clear in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver shakes his head as he walks up to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, so a lightning bolt struck you, and you fell into pieces, literally...And you're still alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to nod as Silver picks up your head. It feels weird being carried by your friend like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you think you can be put back together?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I dunno. But, let's try it.\" you manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver places your head on a rock as he gathers your pieces together. Once or twice, your limbs twitch as you giggle. You were somewhat ticklish, you see. Silver managed to gather your whole body and began reconnecting them. When it was finished, he places your head right where it belongs. You blink as you felt a tingling sensation when your body parts were being put together. As you slowly push yourself into a sitting position, you test everything to make sure it was put back right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so, you're okay now?\" Silver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...My legs don't feel right.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your feet and realized that Silver got your legs switched around. Shaking your head, you point out this flaw to Silver, who smacks his forehead for his own clumsiness. You place a hand on one leg and begin thinking to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could just take this off, I can fix this little mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it came off with a single tug. Silver gave a small yip as you just stared at your re-detached leg. You place another hand on your other leg, pull it off, and put the legs back on your body the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that was...I'm gonna need to get used to that.\" Silver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Silver, how did you find me all the way out here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, I was out looking for some meat. That lightning strike caught my attention, so I decided to take a look. Then, I heard you scream, so I rushed over here, and saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up with Silver's help. Everything feels normal, like you were never broken apart in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...Do you think some kind of magic is at work?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were blasted into pieces, and you were still breathing. Then, it turns out that you can pull yourself apart again. I think that's pretty obvious.\" Silver points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you hold onto his arm for support. You mind wanders a bit as you imagine how Silver would react if this happened to him. Suddenly, you almost fall forward as Silver's entire arm pops right off! Silver screams almost as loud as you did, his arm flailing around in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arm! My arm!\" he shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-calm down! Look, I'm gonna put it back!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the arm back, and Silver moves it around to make sure it's back to normal. Then he looks back at you, surprise in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Felix...I think...That lightning gave you these powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powers? What, to pull myself and others apart? What good will that do for the tribe?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, don't you understand? This must be some kind of sign from the spirits or something! We need to go see the shaman about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver picks up his spear as you think about what he said. It's true that lightning bolts don't normally give someone powers. However, if this really was some kind of sign, why him? There's nothing special about him. At least, that's what he believed. Maybe it would be a good idea to see that shaman about this. Or, he could test out his powers to see what he can really do!</span></div></div>",

From the foliage to your right you heard footsteps, though you were unable to discern if they belonged to a sentient or feral beast.  The footfalls grew in volume, and as they drew nearer a female voice accompanied them.  Still, you did not cry out, unaware if the voice belonged to a friendly tribe or rival villain.  Your tribe knew neighbors of both varieties.  Finally, a figure emerged from the clearing, a coyote of tan complexion and a lithe build, sporting the garb of messenger or scout.  You sighed with relief, the coyotes friendly to your tribe if not properly its ally.  You had just opened your mouth to speak when the coyote, noticing the blackened spot in the ground where the black bolt had dashed you apart and approaching it curiously, tripped over one of your wayward legs and fell directly onto the black spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second bolt of dark lightning streaked down from the heavens, striking the coyote in the small of her back and scattering her body parts as she shrieked in pain.  Just like you, she was broken into six parts; torso, limbs, and head, which were thrown about violently.  You yelped as her torso landed right on top of your head, the impact heavy but thankfully cushioned by her butt which now rested on your scalp.  Her head landed in front of yours, though while you were lucky enough to land in moss the right way up, she had landed on a hard patch of dirt on her side.  You heard a click, and saw the tip of a tooth fly out, though just like you the bolt had knocked her unconscious before she hit the ground.  When her parts had ceased raining down, and the ringing in your ears was again replaced by the sounds of the jungle, you blinked twice and retook stock of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat particular patch of ground was cursed or very special to the gods, you and a coyote scout had both stumbled on it within half a day of each other and were now scattered across the jungle floor in many living pieces, and night was fast approaching.  You were hungry, you were confused, and you wanted to be away from this cursed place and preferably back home before the nocturnal beasts and nighttime stalkers came out.  With these goals in mind, the first thing you do is...</span></div></div>",
