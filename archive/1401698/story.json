Then a second later his partner, a more harsh woman, yells \"MOVE NOW OR I`LL CHOP YOU HEAD OFF!\" You jump out of your bed and nearly out of your skin. you start to head to the observatory.They follow behind you closely and proud of you as their student.You known them both for along time but they never acted like this.

Both elders gave the book of world to you and with a pen. you first filled the pen with the black liquid from the pool as the ritual says to.you open your book and the first page was a map of a world and on the second had a picture of a person falling with a book with him. The elder woman said \"this is my favorite part.\" Not paying attention you touch the picture and started to fall. The sky around you rushing. you was heading towards the ground.You hear a voice next to you then an other you relies it the book and the voice were that of your teachers.
