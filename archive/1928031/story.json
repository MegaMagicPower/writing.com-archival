You only see it for a second before his towel is back on, and he rolls back into his room and slams the door. The construction paper label the RA pinned to his corkboard falls down on to your thigh. Your new hung neighbor is apparently named Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nonchalantly as you can, you put your towel back around your waist, set his shampoo outside his door and continue to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn returning, you find another boy in your room. He's short, shorter than you, at least, and has a sort of wild mop of blonde hair a little matted down from sweat. He sets down a moving box of his own and flops onto the bed, hands up over his head. His tshirt lifts up from his shorts. It shows a surprisingly thick treasure trail, also blonde, across the slightest curve of belly. You catch yourself staring before he sits up, and toss your toiletries onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits up and looks at you. Really, he stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd describe your physique as average, but clearly he wouldn't. You work out, but not much with cardio, so you've got great pecs and arms with just a hint of starter belly roll, highlighted by the cincture of your towel wrap. You're still dripping from hair down from the shower, and you've never been the best at rewding these kind of things, but you're pretty sure he'd like to lick those drops right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the spell is broken by another boy yelling as he backs through the door. \"Jimmy! Aren't you done with that box? There's still a bunch more stuff to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boy is blonde, too, but where Jimmy had the slightest hint of belly, this one has the whole thing. You guess he's 5'9 or so, but about 250 lbs. His shirt is soaked with sweat and he's carrying three large boxes, two of which tumble out of his grasp as he backs through the door. The top one falls towards you, and you grab it, dislodging your towel in the process. The middle one falls towards Jimmy, who catches it just before it hits the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, from his now prone perspective on the ground, is most definitely checking out your crotch. The chubby blonde boy in front of you is now redfaced. But with both of them now facing you its easy to see they are brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\" You say, not sure what else to do. \"Can you guys give me a minute? This towel dropping thing seems to keep happening to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy and his brother leave the room. As you throw on a pair of jeans and a white shirt, you can hear Jimmy being berated by his brother, not responding. When you open the door, the brother is still staring at Jimmy and takes a second before he turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Chris. Your new roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake hands. It's a little awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my little brother Jimmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy scoffs at the word little, and murmurs, \"not even by a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris scowls at Jimmy and directs him to the outside door. \"We should be done unloading in about 20 minutes. Sorry about that earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok. Hey I'm...</span></div></div>",

It's pretty crazy inside, with moving day in full swing, but you manage to hold off a few seats at a table, and Chris and Jimmy find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he's not sweating so wildly, or moving, he seems much more relaxed and fun to be around. You're a little surprised, though, at the lack of hardly anything on his plate. You would expect such a big boy to be starved after a moving day, but you don't say anything about his salad, fruits and roasted veggie plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, on the other hand, looks ecstatic at the huge variety of options out there and available for free. His tray is stacked with pizza, burgers and a couple of hot dogs, which he eagerly chows down on while the new roommates get to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out Chris is a computer science major, which is why he doesn't get out much for exercise. He plans to change that here, and hopes to get the freshman 15 in reverse. You try to assure him he looks good, but he brushes off the compliment. While you have totally different majors, it turns out you'll be in a morning gen ed class together once a week, so you can help wake each other up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris is from nearby, his parents live only about half an hour away, but they had to leave early so it's just Jimmy who's going to drive the car back afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch lasts about half an hour, with Jimmy surprisingly being the first to finish up. You notice him checking out boys, and only boys, as you and Chris chat.</span></div></div>",

You wonder when you'll see Jimmy again, and you guess quite soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris starts to work up a sweat again as he unpacks the many boxes they hauled in. You offer to help, but he says for this part he needs to figure out where everything goes. You feel awkward just sitting there watching him do heavy lifting, so you head out into the hall. Sam's door is closed, but several others down the way are open. You hear a familiar plasma grenade explosion as you pass by a room with Halo on the big screen. In another room, they've lofted both beds at either end and made room for couches -- Real Genius is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next room is your RA, Kyle, whom you almost run into as he comes out the door just as you're passing. Kyle's room is a special suite, and has a kitchen, where he's been baking. The smell of freshly baked brownies rolls out of his door. You could measure the speed at which such things travel, because at least one person from each room in the hall emerges as it reaches their door. Even Sam comes out, though he looks away awkwardly when he sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Kyle says. This is when I'm supposed to have the hall meeting and collect your signed agreements, so here's the deal. Sign these forms, then you get a brownie. Sound cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you might have the coolest RA ever. The emerging wingmates give their assent (grunt it, from the Halo players) and move forward to sign. Each hungrily takes a brownie as they complete the paperwork. You're closest, but hang back to let everybody go so you can check them all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not the pickiest person but you definitely live in a cute boy wing, and look forward to catching glances in the communal showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they've all signed and grabbed their brownies, you get yours and take a bite. It's delicious of course, but there's a special taste you've only had once before in a brownie...</span></div></div>",

He smiles, gently, and returns to his room. Before he shuts the door, he says \"be sure not to miss the welcome dinner in about 45 minutes. I'll be by to remind everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a freshman, granted, but you've never heard of an RA using the munchies to motivate his wing. You finish off your brownie and head over to the last open door on the wing. Like the rest, it's a double, but only one roommate seems to have arrived. He comes to the door when he sees you near it, and extends his hand. \"Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake back, and give him your name. Peter's almost exactly your height, and you look eqch other directly in the eyes. His are strikingly green. His brown hair's messy but cute, and his smile entrancing. Physically, he's about average build, but the tshirt he's wearing hugs a belly. You cant tell if the shirt is old, or the belly recent, but it certainly does suit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe invites you in and you sit on the small couch he's set up. Peter doesn't have a big screen, but he sets a laptop on the chair in front of you and pops a bag of popcorn. You browse through his Netflix queue together before settling on something and sitting down to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that, when he returns to sit down with the bag of popcorn, he...</span></div></div>",

Usually, you're a little picky about potato chips -- they're ok, but after a few handfuls they feel greasy, even in your favorite flavors. But this bag, placed right under your nose, seems to set off the munchies -- well ahead of when they should. You and Peter shovel handfuls of chips from the bag into your mouth, and in minutes the family size bag is gone before you even realize -- you forgot to hit play on what you were going to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, and then sheepishly ask \"Do you have--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"another bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter indicates where they're kept and you grab them, noticing that he's brought a whole case just of this flavor.

Your hands are full of toiletries that you don't want to drop, but the prospect of being fully exposed is probably worse. You turn, gently and slowly, to see the fiendish grin of sandy-haired prankster behind you. He's wearing his own towel, his free hand holding the sensible basket with all his toiletries. (I have got to get one, you think) before realizing your way out. You surprise yourself with the agility of this move as you toss the soap and washcloth into his bucket and grab your assailant's towel with your now free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it is to be a stalemate. The prankster's grin shifts into a look of impressed surprise, but he does not let go of your towel. You size each other up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has a build you're familiar with -- you like to call it Swimmer's +6, referring to the 6 months it's been since swim season ended. He has pecs, though they're slim, like his arms and legs, but the beginnings of a paunch are resting atop the towel you now grasp. Your hand is at his side, and can feel the heat coming from his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at each other, instinctively knowing not to blink or speak -- waiting for the opportunity, the moment when the other loses focus and an advantage can be taken. But nothing happens. Your wing is surprisingly empty for move-in day. You decide to make a daring move - a step towards the showers. The blonde boy follows. You take another step and so does he. In the smallest of increments, you both begin to move toward the showers, not daring to move quickly or lose the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his towel, you feel his thighs push against your fingers. The muscle twinges with each step, but you realize there's a little fat there too, that you couldn't see. You realize just how close your hand is to his crotch (and his to yours) and the excitement part of this scenario kicks into gear. With a split second to make a decision before your growing erection does what his hand's been threatening to do to your towel, you yank his away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise of mutually assured destruction holds true as he pulls on your towel. You both run the rest of the way to the shower. With all the flapping going on, you can't tell if he's as hard as you, but you can see a gifted endowment between his legs. In the showers you run into adjacent shower stalls. You hear laughter from his, and then a peace offering -- your towel is thrown over the stall wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",
