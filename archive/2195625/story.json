            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thanks to glarg for making this interactive. Okay, this story is set in the year 2983 and begins aboard The Wailing Winds, a slave ship of the distant intergalactic government of Rigel. The planet of Earth was invaded by the Rigelian Armed Forces and, after a brief war, the armies of Earth surrendered and agreed to become a Rigelian colony. It was also agreed that every 100 years a group of Terra (Earth) citizens would be sent to Rigel\u2019s home planet as slaves in order to keep the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is going to focus on Andronicus Rex, AKA Rex, a security officer aboard The Wailing Winds. He\u2019s one of the only humans employed by the Rigelian security force and thus his abilities are constantly being questioned, making him feel like an outsider. He\u2019s 35 years old (a baby compared to some of his coworkers) and has a ruggedly handsome look with his shaggy blonde hair and scraggly beard. He\u2019s 6\u20191\u201d with an impressive physique and toned muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other main character is Arielis, a Rigelian-human hybrid sent to Rigel on a secret mission. As one of the rare Rigelian-humans, she\u2019s been labelled as an outcast by both sides and has faced lots of persecution in her mostly unknown past. She\u2019s known all around the galaxy as an anti-Rigel activist and has been arrested countless times for rallying protestors, organising strikes or even blowing up Rigelian government buildings. She is a willowy girl and is pretty attractive despite her insect-like, multifaceted eyes and her 3-fingered hands and toes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the lonely moments like this that made Rex hate his job sometimes. The stars shone raggedly through the porthole of the Rigelian ship as he walked nonchalantly along the empty hallways. Every few seconds he\u2019d take a quick glance at his standard-issue, hi-tech wristband which was tied to the ships systems. <i>\u2019Yup,\u2019</i> he yawned, <i>\u2019Still normal.\u2019</i> Just as he was about to return to his cryopod to try and sleep through the remainder of the painstakingly tedious journey to Rigel, his wristband began to beep with increasing urgency. A pod in SubDeck-P6 was opening. The ship was still 3 light years from its destination-there was NO reason for any of the pods to be opening this far from port. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetouring quickly to pick up a plasma gun from one of the portable armouries, Rex swiftly made his way to the lift, swiping his card and punching in his hexadecimal security access code. <i>\u2019Crap, the bloody thing is busted again...\u2019</i> he muttered under his breath frustratedly. He typed rapidly into the lift\u2019s on-screen keyboard and after a few seconds the ship's computer said that access to SubDeck-P6 was restricted to administrative personnel only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex brought up the ship's layout on the screen and cross referenced it with the ship's manifest. According to the manifest, that SubDeck was carrying the child slaves bound for the royal pleasure palaces. He didn\u2019t necessarily agree with using kids as sex slaves but escaping captives weren\u2019t good for either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much hemming and hawing Rex decided the best course of action was to take the maintainance ladder. He sprinted down another corridor with his plasma gun in hand, his eyes scanning the metallic walls for the corrugated maintenance hatch. He grinned as he saw the small, iron door glinting in the unnatural blue light. He grunted as he ripped off the hatch and crawled inside. He cursed as he hopped onto the rusting ladder and began his descent into the underbelly of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, he finally reached the SubDeck he\u2019d been looking for. Rex pushed on the hatch with all his strength but this hatch refused to budge. First one, then two, then three slender fingers slid into the small space between the hatch and the bulkhead. He rolled his eyes and used his gun to laser off the rusted coating surrounding it, the hatch door swinging open with astonishing ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he climbed out of the maintaince tube he looked around: huh, nothing was wrong with any of the pods- they all looked to be undisturbed. <i>Must have been a false alarm...</i> Rex thought. He wasn\u2019t so sure though: the room was quiet, eerily quiet, and his honed senses were telling him something wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rex felt someone jump onto the back of his neck and hold on tightly. He howled and bucked as the stranger continued to hold on, the scene reminiscent to a bull-rider trying to stay on a bull. Alas, all bull-riders must fall and so did the figure after a couple of seconds. Rex spun and instantly pointed the barrel of his weapon at the figure\u2019s head but, for whatever reason, he hesitated to pull the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger was definitely alien, possessing what Rex believed to be female features (he couldn\u2019t be sure though- aliens are weird). She was a willowy girl, no more than about 18, wearing what looked like an innocent floral dress. He noted with a growing unease that her eyes multifaceted like an insect and she had 3 fingers on each hand and 3 toes on her bare feet, the trademark features of a Rigelian. However, unlike your average Rigelian citizen, she didn\u2019t have the usual blue-tinted skin- instead her complexion was creamy, a light chestnut colour that Rex had only seen amongst Terran civilisations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sweaty palms gripped the gun tighter, the red dot of the scope levelling on a spot in between her eyes. \u201cTell me who you are,\u201d Rex commanded monotonously, \u201cAnd how the hell you got out of your pod.\u201d His finger closed around the trigger as the girl stood up and raised her hands in surrender. \u201cMy name is Arielis,\u201d she spoke softly, \u201cand...\u201d</span></div></div>",
