You put your ID card back on the nightstand and head toward the shower to get ready for the day, after a nice hot shower and shave you put on your tiger striped fatigues and head out. The hallway outside your room looked like a combination of a prison and the inside of an aircraft carrier with the floor being metal grates and the walls made of reinforced concrete. You walk down a set of stairs onto the bottom concrete floor and head off in the direction of the cafeteria, as you walked there was no one else in the hall so it was just you and the sound of your combat boots clicking on the floor. Suddenly you feel a hand on your shoulder, making you wheel about with a raised fist, but you say it was just your friend Lance Corporal Mike Ramirez, Mike was in the Marines while you were Army, the security team that you were part of was made up of different members of the military, even the coast guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy\" said Mike with his hands raised, \"sorry still a little jumpy even after getting jumped by that...crap what did the techs call that thing?\" you ask. \"Oh I think they named it a slime, hell I don't remember\" he says, \"so whats up?\" you ask, \"rumor is they found another planet and they're sending out someone to scout it out, you know deep recon, gonna be out at least a week to check it out\" he says. \"Sucks to be that guy\" you say, just then the intercom woke up, \"Sergeant Grimm please report to the command room\" it spoke, Mike laughed and poked you in the arm, \"you jinked yourself on that one\" he teased, you lightly shove him, \"shut up you don't know if its even for that recon job\" you say, the two of you part ways with you walking to the command room, when you walked in the first thing you saw were diagrams and holograms floating on the large table in the center of the room, \"ah Sergeant we have a job for you\" said a voice that you recognized as the facility's security commander, next to him was the civilian that was in charge of all the science teams in the research facility. \"we have recently discovered another planet that needs to be scouted out before we can send in the science teams you know standard stuff, but instead of the usual week we are extending it to one month\" says the base commander, at hearing this you were shocked, no one had ever been put in for so long. The civilian stepped forward, \"no need to worry though we will be monitoring everything through probes that we sent in ahead of time so if you run into trouble we will be listening. The planet has earth like atmosphere and normal gravity, but you will still wear your protective gear until the all clear, we will make continuous supply drops through the portal to you on set dates, and while you're there try to take some notes of your own\" he says. \"Any question Sergeant?\" the facility commander asked, \"yeah can I get my breakfast first?\" you say, the commander laughed, \"yes Staff sergeant you can, dismissed\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun on your heel and left the room, walking toward the cafeteria to grab a quick breakfast before being sent out. You grab a tray of food and wolf it down before heading to the ready room to suit up, you picked up your MOPP 4 suit or Mission Orientated Protective Posture, which was basically a bulk suit and mask that protected you from anything Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical that was in the air. You had to wear the suit along with your standard combat load, an M4, M9, and your kevlar protection, along with non-lethal weapons to defend yourself. The M4 and M9 were supposed to be used in last resort scenarios, you suit up and grab your stuff and head into what the rest of the security team dub \"the portal to hell\" because you never know what's going to be on the other side. The portal wasn't anything showy just a large beam of blue light, which you stepped through, you experience a moment of light headedness which passed quickly. On the other end of the portal you found yourself..............</span></div></div>",

Stacked all around the portal were crates of food, water and any other supplies you would need to live on the planet for the next month. You look at the geiger counter in your gloved hands, \"no abnormal radiation\" you say into your radio which transmitted back through the open portal to the research facility. \"Yeah we detected no traces of hazardous chemicals or biologicals so its safe to remove your suit, but keep the mask handy if you run into any lifeforms\" was the response on your radio. \"Roger that\" you say into the radio and start to undo the suit, after taking of your MOPP suit you start unpacking the crates and erecting the tent that will be your home for the next month, an hour later you had set up a small base of operation near the exit portal, complete with the latest in motion sensor fencing to alert you to anything that might try to sneak up on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you finished setting up, the planet's sun was dipping below the horizon, you look up into the sky and are surprised to see there were three moons floating in the sky, \"wow, wonder what other surprises this place has in store for me\" you say to yourself. Just then your radio spoke up, \"ok Sergeant we are going to shut down the portal for the night, we will reopen it at 04:00 earth time, stay safe\", \"roger\" you say. The portal outside the tent disappeared and with it the only way to communicate with everyone back on Earth, you start the small stove inside your tent and cooked one of the instant meals that you had and started an entry in one of the journals you brought with you. It wasn't one of those \"Dear diary\" type things, but just something for the science tech to use when you got back, after eating and finishing your entry you lay down on your cot and drift off to sleep...........</span></div></div>",

You reach over and make sure your weapons are near if you need to use them, unfortunately for you, you remember you had standing orders to investigate anything you find on the planet, so that meant finding the source of the noise. You grab your gear and mask, but you leave the bulk MOPP suit behind, you grab some recording devices, cameras,notebooks, and head off in the direction of the howl-like noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked for about two hours you hear the inhuman howling noise again, but this time it was much closer and it made your skin crawl.

As you looked deeper into the city, the buildings became more and more modern, evolving from stone walls to metal and then to concrete. The outer part of the city as dark, but as you looked toward the city center you saw lights and heard the loud, inhuman howling again, you shake your head and start silently making your way towards the city to do a quick recon and also because you were curious as to what was making the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the first building after stealthily descending the hill, using the moon light you walk down the street towards the city center to get a good look at whatever was possibly living in these buildings. After walking extremely slow down the roads, you finally reach the city center, you stop at a nearby building and peek around the corner, what you discover leaves you completely speechless. The lights and the howling was from some sort of celebration, but it was the people that were celebrating that left you speechless. All around the city center were these animal, but they weren't 100% animals, they had human-like traits, you watched these strange creatures dance around what looked like a fire pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the animals you saw were normal like foxes and leopards, even a few that looked like domesticated dogs and cats, but there were a few that looked to be a mix of animals, you saw one that looked to be a cross between a wolf and a tiger.</span></div></div>",

You get out of your cot and grab your gear, making sure your mask was on before your exited the tent. You turn on your rifle's flashlight and head toward the section of fence that the anomaly came from, as you near the fencing you saw one of the sensors had been knocked over,at first you thought it had been knocked over by the wind, but you saw what looked like animal prints on the ground. You hear a rustling in the grass behind you, you spin around with rifle at the ready and the flashlight on the spot where you heard the noise, \"hello?\" you say threw your mask, \"like whoever lives here is going to know english\" you say in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you saw a patch of vegetation rustle, as whatever was in it moved closer to you. You flicked off your safety and prepared to defend yourself should whatever was in the grass decided to attack you. The grass started to part as the creature made its way to you, \"please don't let it be another slime\" you started repeating in your head, suddenly whatever was moving to you stopped halfway and a fox head popped up, \"what the-\" you said, lowering your rifle slightly. You walk toward the fox with one hand out and the other holding your rifle forward, the fox didn't seem like it was going to harm you as you neared, \"please don't hurt me\" the fox suddenly spoke in a female voice. You jump back in surprise that not only did the fox just speak, but it spoke perfect English. You manage to compose yourself quickly, \"I won't hurt you\" you say as you again near the strange fox with your hand out. She sniffs your hand the way a dog would, she must of determined that you weren't a threat because she smiled at you, \"my name is Amber,\" she says with a smile. Now you were defiantly confused, you were on a completely alien-like planet and you met a fox, that at first was afraid of you and now was acting like she was your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhhhhmmmm..........my name's Christopher\" you say, \" well Christopher I don't mean to be rude, but you look and sound a little weird\" says Amber, you let out a small laugh. \"Its because I'm wearing a mask\" you say, Amber tilts her head in confusion, \"its to protect me from anything hazardous in the air\" you clarify. \"Oh well I'm not hazardous\" she says, you nod and decide to remove the mask, \"shes just a fox right, so I guess she won't have some alien virus\" you say to yourself. Amber looked at you wide eyed, slowly a furry paw reach up and started to touch your face, her hand was soft to the touch from the fur. As she examined your face you noticed that she had human-like qualities like arms and thats when you noticed she was laying on the ground like she had been crawling. \"Are you hurt?\" you ask, Amber took her paw away from your face and nodded, \"wait here\" you say, quickly you walk over to the sensor and reset it and then you walk back to Amber. \"Give me your arm\" you say, she holds out her left arm and you help her to her feet and take her back toward your camp, \" so Amber if its ok, what are yo doing all the way out here?\" you ask......</span></div></div>",

Leaning over her shoulder, you feel your jaw drop ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, we've finally done it... We've finally found an inhabited world...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick your cracked lips and swallow heavily. Glancing around at the impeccably tidy workspace, you fidget slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you sent the data to the high-up's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou colleague nods once again, now examining a different set of data. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This truly is a landmark achievement. We're probably going to be flooded with camera crews any minute now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour colleague is too engrossed in her data readouts to reply. Leaving her to her work, you begin making your way through the complex to the portal itself.

You weren't sure of his name, bit his skin was pale, his hair dark, and he was just slightly shorter than you. Other than that, he was physically unremarkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already explained this to you,\" you begin. \"Three reasons: one, that recession a few years back hit Europe hard. Secondly, the Americans have a fusion reactor. Granted, the Torus in Europe is arguably more suited to powering the Portal, but this leads on to my third point; empty space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man - what was his name? Ah, that was it! Steven quirks an eyebrow at the last point, inviting you to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Europe tends to have a very high population density. America, on the other hand, tends to have a lower population density. Thus, this compound being a good distance away from the faintest signs of civilisation. If something goes wrong we'll probably all die, but hopefully it'll just be us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven bites his lip as you finish the explanation. \"I see your point. Thank you, doctor... Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a short breath, you inform him of your name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! My apologies, I haven't had much sleep lately.

Suddenly, the humming... It was hard to describe, the noise it made. Suffice it to say that the humming reversed, grew lower in pitch, and then collapsed in on itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling the portal's frame is a scar in the fabric of Spacetime.

A multitude of colours shift and dance before your eyes, joining into cohesive structures at random. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the colours dissolve into nothingness, and time speeds back up to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapse to your knees as a stabbing pain overrides your muscles and sends you crashing to the floor, vision tainted red. You can feel something dripping down your face from your eyes, but it doesn't feel like blood. It's too thick, too slow. And besides, it's not your eyes that hurt, it's your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body begins to itch maddeningly and you begin to scrape yourself along the floor in a futile attempt to rid yourself of the situation. You are dimly aware of the others in the room suffering a similar torment, but your mind is fully concentrated on yourself as a small circular area of your skin begins to prickle, feeling as if it is being stabbed by a thousand tiny needles. The area shifts this way and that, and you can feel a horrified presence somewhere not quite inside the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dread wind suddenly picks up, blowing towards the portal. The forming vortex stutters repeatedly, as if someone in a laboratory like your own were attempting to turn it off, repeatedly, and to no avail. Clawing at the floor, you desperately try to drag yourself away from the portal. Unfortunately for you, however, you can't find anything to grab onto. You slowly slide towards the portal, leaving a thin trail of red-black liquid as your randomly aching muscles seize and spasm as you draw closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is times like this that make you wish that you had no senses.

Instead of feeling like a gentle hand, however, it only makes the areas it touches burn with sheer sensory overload, each one of the fine hairs on it like a tiny knife cutting into your skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your right eye just a touch - the left was gummed up with something that stung the eye and eyelids. What you see makes you wish you hadn't opened your eyes. Everything is static, but some chunks of static are larger and further away, or smaller and closer. You have no depth perception in this horrid and alien environment, and the swirling and clashing pixels of black and white quickly make you feel sick to your stomach. The static-hand that was stroking you in an attempt to help soothe your pain ceases its unwitting assault as a muzzle formed of dancing light enters your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrewing your eyes shut, you feel a familiar bodily fluid once again begin to drip from your eyes and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the speaking starts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&amp;:((\u00a3/&amp;/,\"<br>\r\n\"4(/.-/&amp;\u00a3())\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't understand it. Certain sounds match up but their meaning is lost amidst the sea of static as your ears begin to ring, quickly becoming unresponsive as your body cuts itself off from the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only hope that your body learns to adapt to this environment. </span></div></div>",
