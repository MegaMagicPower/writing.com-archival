After waiting in line for what seemed like hours (and it probably was) a man in glasses asked for your ID and all that technical crap.  He gave you your Pokedex, which, of course, also functions as your new Trainer's ID, and a new function, it hold all your minimized Poke Balls in it, negating the need for a belt.  After the man helped you program your Pokedex, he asked you what starter you wanted.

If you catch it of course.  It was perched on a tree, facing away from you, so you decide to sneak attack it.  You tap Gecko on the shoulder and motion towards it.  He understands, nods, and sneaks towards the tree.  Once he was about halfway up the tree he looked at you and you mouthed the words, \"Brick Break.\"  Gecko leaped towards the Gligar, and swung his fist at its back, only for it to dodge at the last second.  He was toying with you.  The Gligar flew out of Gecko's reach and taunted him while Gecko Leered him, but it had no effect.  \"DAMN IT!\" you shout.  It was just your luck for you to find a Gligar and have no projectile moves.  The Gligar had a type advantage, and he knew it.  He could've flown away and just left you standing there, but he accepted your challenge and dove towards Gecko.  He didn't need to be told to dodge and practically closelined the bat, causing him to crash into the ground, and Gecko took the opportunity to smash him in the back.  He screeched in pain and you almost felt sorry for him, until he turned and gave Gecko a nasty scratch on the face.  He lifted off into the air, having some trouble.  You got an idea, looked at Gecko and said, \"Do you know how to play chicken?\"  He grinned, Gligar screeched then swooped down as Gecko charged him.  At the last second Gecko did a sudden frontflip/jump and slammed his tail into Gligar, ramming him into the ground again.  Gligar quickly flipped over and started slashing Gecko mercilessly, and Gecko returned the favor.  They were moving so fast you couldn't tell who was winning, until one final Brick Break caused Gligar to skid away, unconcious.  Gecko fainted soon after.  You recalled him, caught Gligar, and named him Skorpio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice catch!\"  You whipped around and there was Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you saw that?

Falkner shouted to use Whirlwind when he recovered.  Star made a valiant effort to dodge, but was hit anyway since it's hard to dodge wind.  She was slammed into the wall but stood up quickly.  \"Another Swift!\" shouted Anna.  Star didn't seem to mind attacking from a distance and sent another shower of stars at Pidgey.  Falkner looked exasperated, he usually fought 10-year olds with no skill, but this was ridiculous.

As fast and hard as you can!\"  Star sent some stars at Pidgeotto, and he flew right through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scratch!\"  Anna yelled.  The two Pokemon collided in a flurry of fur and feathers that lasted seconds.  Star was thrown from the fray with a thud and was unconcious, but Pidgeotto had a pained look in his eyes.  (For multiple reasons.)  Anna sent out Tori with a confident look in HER eyes.  When Pidgeotto saw his opponent, he sprang into action and took off.  Tori followed suit.  They circled the arena for a bit, until Falkner ordered a Whirlwind.  \"Whirlwind back at him!\"  Anna shouted.  The two miniature tornadoes impacted in the exact center of the circle they were flying, and the resulting backlash sent both Pokemon spiraling towards the ground.  \"Divebomb him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull up, Pidgeotto!\"  but it was no use.  Tori, for whatever reason, was higher than Pidgeotto, and had a bird's eye view (pardon the pun) of Pidgeotto, and hit her target perfectly.  They both slammed into the ground with Tori on top, and Pidgeotto was motionless.  Falkner sighed, recalled Pidgeotto, and flicked a badge in Anna's direction like a quarter.  Pidgey flew up and caught it, however, and gave it to Anna.  Anna returned Tori and picked a bench to watch YOU battle Falkner.  But just then...</span></div></div>",

This time when they returned to normal, they looked like they belonged to someone who thought they knew everything.  Your jaw dropped yet again when she pressed a button on her PokeTech and her entire outfit changed color and look.  Where she had black cargo pants, she now had green, pocketless shorts.

He didn't even reach for a Poke ball, he just threw Maya a badge.  Maya stood motionless for a moment with her back to you and you realized she was probably freezing up again.  Your insides gave a twitch when she switched her clothes back to the ones that were so strangely similar to yours.  \"What now, punk?  Not so tough now are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly jumped out of your skin when Anna came up behind you and tapped you on the shoulder.

Even though you liked Maya, Anna had really grown on you too.  Would she still follow you around?  You turned to her with a confused look on your face and she said that her boyfriend was out of the country so she would be happy to accompany you until he got back.

You didn't notice until she turned around, ice cream in hand, with yet another facial expression.  Now she just looked full of energy and like she would start running around randomly at any moment.  You had no idea what to think of this and let her walk away again.  You decided to follow her until you saw another good opportunity to say hello.  You took your chance after she changed her clothes back to green and started complaining to the ice cream man that her ice cream was made from 2% milk and not skim like she requested (she could tell becuase of the way it was melting and the amount of shine it gave when exposed to the sun).  You decided to take the direct approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Maya!\"  She didn't respond at first and you had to repeat her name before you got an answer.  It wasn't what you expected though.  She switched her clothes back to your style (dark blue and black), THEN turned to talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\"  She followed by licking her ice cream, not seeming to care that it was 2% anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering how you keep changing clothes like that,\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just an app my dad invented for the Poketech.

I don't do cheaters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no,\" you quickly say, \"she actually gave me permission to come see you, she's waiting for me in the gym now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought a little more, bit the top half of her ice cream cone off, and said, \"Alright, but if she's not there, I\"m out.\"</span></div></div>",

Falkner sent out his Pidgey with a smirk, he obviously thought this would be an easy win, but boy was he suprised when Gecko dashed up and smashed Pidgey with a Brick Break.  He shouted to stay at a distance and use Whirlwind a lot, all of which Gecko expertly dodged.  Pidgey drifted close to one wall and you told Gecko to wall-jump.  \"GET AWAY FROM THE WALL!\"  Falkner shouted, but it was too late.  By the time Pidgey registered his command, Gecko was half-way through a frontflip directly above Pidgey.  Just when Pidgey attempted to move out of the way, he was slammed into the ground by Gecko's tail.  Two attacks had taken down Pidgey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha!  This is too easy!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky yet!\" Falkner replied.  He sent out Pidgeotto.  \"I've been saving this for a special occasion,\" and he pulled an X Speed out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO YOU DON'T!\"  May shouted.  The next thing you knew, a blur had swiped the X Speed from Falkner's hand.  When it slowed down, you saw it was a Sneasel.  \"You are NOT pulling THAT trick again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\"  Now it was Falkner's turn to shout.  \"THAT IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE POKEMON GYM CODE OF CONDUCT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, it might be,\" Maya said a little too calmly.  \"But 1.,  So is being a dishonorable scumbag, and 2., you're not gonna do anything about it, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalkner opened his mouth as to say something, but then closed it with a beaten look on his face (I use that phrase a lot, don't I?).</span></div></div>",

Talk about ironic!  Pidgeotto rolled his eyes and realized he was on his own again.  He didn't really feel like sand in his eyes, so he stayed high.  You were about to give Skorpio another command when he pulled off an amazing move.  He flew as fast as possible in a tight spiral directly underneath Pidgeotto, and used Sand Tomb!  \"Woah!  Nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHIRLWIND!'  Pidgeotto did just that and dissipated the tornado of whirling grit, but not before Skorpio launched a Sand-Attack at his face and landed a Poison Sting on his back.  Pidgeotto launched himself at Skorpio and connected, but got stung again anyway.  Skorpio was really a lemon to lemonade guy, um, bat.  Falkner's rage was starting to pour over onto Pidgeotto, and he abandoned all caution and decided to melee this Gligar.  It reminded you a lot of how Star Vs. Pidgeotto went, except no fur.  When the blurs unblurred, Skorpio was unconcious.  However, Pidgeotto collapsed within seconds.  Apparently one of those Poison Stings poisoned him.</span></div></div>",

Shade knew this prank would take a lot of energy and focus, since he wasn't that powerful yet, but it would be worth it in the end.  First, he carefully unzipped her sleeping bag all the way and moved Star away from Anna so that she wouldn't wake.  He then began the long, painstaking process of removing all her clothes, piece by piece, extremely slowly and carefully.  He started with the easiest part, her gloves.  All he had to do was raise her hands a bit, slip them off, and throw them towards the thicker part of the woods  Shade took a moment to decide what to remove next, and decided the shirt and bra would go first.  He chuckled silently as he deliberately made her sit up in her sleep and slid it up and off her body.  The shirt was then sent behind the Pokemon Center.  Shade was getting really excited when Anna mumbled a bit in her sleep so he gently laid her back down and waited for her to drift back into her deep sleep.  Shade took a closer look at Anna's pink bra.  It wasn't anything special, and it was the kind that fastened in the back.  He made her sit up again and smoothly slipped the bra off, exposing her pert b-cup breasts to the world.  It was chilly with the fire out and her nipples were hard as rock.  Shade softly licked them each a few times then laid her down to fall back asleep completely.  Finally, he raised her legs at a 45 degree angle and slowly slid off both her red pants and pink panties.  Shade took a good, long, close-up look at her pussy, but he also obscured the narrator's view of it, so I can't honestly say what it looks like right now.  (That will be in the next \"Spectrophilia\" chapter.)  Shade scattered her clothes nearby and poured a canteen around Nick's sleeping bag, so that he would not be blamed since there were no footprints.  Shade took care of some \"ghostly business,\" don't ask how, then went to sleep next to Nick, waiting for the fun to begin.</span></div></div>",

Star could not see her clothes anywhere nearby, so she nuzzled the back of Anna's head until she woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh, why is it so cold?\" was her first response.  She rolled over towards Star, still oblivious.  \"Why'd you wake me up?\"  Star shielded her eyes and Anna finally understood.  \"Oh my God where did my clothes go?!\"  Star sniffed Anna and tried to sniff out their locations while Anna silently put on her shoes and wrapped up in a towel.  Star finally found her shirt behind the Pokemon Center and brought it to Anna.  She placed it in her tent and helped Star look for the rest.  They found one glove in a tree and the other close by.  They had some trouble finding the rest until Star found her panties and jeans quite a distance away.  Anna slipped them on quickly as Star kept going back towards Violet City.  She quickly lost the scent, however, and turned to camp.  Anna went ahead and slipped on her shirt.  Star found one last trace of Anna's scent and found her last article of clothing, her bra, near the entrance to Union Cave.  They walked back to camp while Anna put on her bra under her shirt.  \"Who could have done this?\"  Star tilted her head in a display of confusion.  Anna checked the campsite for any evidence and found none, other than the fact that the ground around Nick was wet with water.  'Whoever did this specifically wanted to be sure that Nick was not blamed,' she thought to herself.  Shaken as she was, Anna laid back down and tried to get some more shut eye before the sun rose.</span></div></div>",

Hellfire scraped his claw against Skorpio as Skorpio blew a significant amount of dust into Hellfire's eyes.  The Scratch downed the weakened Gligar, and the Charmeleon could barely see anything now that there was both smoke and sand.  You quickly sent out Gecko and ordered a Brick Break.  While Hellfire was still blind, Gecko landed a strong blow right to the Charmeleon's forehead, knocking him out cold.  The opposing trainer facepalmed and sent out his last Pokemon, a little Aron named Brimstone.  \"Try not to get hit and use Headbutt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brick Break again!\"  Both Pokemon ran towards each other again.  The Aron should be finished quickly since Brick Break is quadruply effective, but Gecko wasn't exactly in prime condition either.  Gecko tried to jump at the last minute and hit Brimstone in the back, but he also leapt into the air and Gecko got Headbutted in the chest.  Gecko landed, panting.  The Aron was still in prime condition, although Gecko probably couldn't take another Headbutt.  \"Come on, Gecko!  One Brick Break and it's over!\"  Gecko charged a final time, and so did Brimstone.  Neither Pokemon jumped this time, and both took massive damage from the collision.  A crack went down Brimstone's skull and Gecko's fist crumbled from the combined force.  Both were seriously wounded, and the battle ended in a tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent quickly withdraws the crippled Aron.  \"We'll meet again,\" he says as he steps back into the shadows.  You also withdraw Gecko and heal Shade, since he is the only one who doesn't need real medical attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was intense,\" Anna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya,\" you reply.  \"We need to hurry and get through this cave.\"</span></div></div>",

Nick's quick reflexes allowed him to cover his ears before the blast hit, but Gecko wasn't so lucky and got a painful earful.  \"Now Taunt!\"  Midnight laughed maliciously and said something to Gecko that infuriated him and caused him to use Quick Attack without direction.

Midnight proved too fast for most of the physical moves to hit, but the Absorbs nearly always hit their mark.  Nick realized this and istructed Gecko to use more Absorbs, which now had him healed fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight was landing several hits of her own, and landed a Scratch on Gecko's shoulder along with a few more Faint Attacks.  Maya could see that they were evenly matched.  \"Use Assassinate,\" she said calmly and spookily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn these code words,\" Nick said to himself again.  Midnight sneered and faded away.  Gecko glanced around for his arrogant adversary.  Just as Gecko was losing patience, Midnight reappeared.  Midnight jabbed him in the stomach, then issued a devastating uppercut to Gecko's chin, which sent him flipping back towards Nick and knocked him out.  Nick was baffled until he noticed a layer of ice on the bottom half of Gecko's face.  Midnight knew Ice Punch.  She cackled again and Nick scowled.

There is a metal crest/helmet on it's head and shinguard-like things on it's legs.  It actually walks on the tips of these, however.  It can fire these metal pieces and control them when they are detached from it's body.  It can also retract all the metal parts into a ball, facilitating the use of moves such as Gyro Ball, Rollout, etc.  It's now Ghost/Steel type.  It's ability is now Battle Armor and/or Rock Head.

Anything is allowed, but if you are adding a \"gray\" chapter, (sex, vore, scat) PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD give us a choice whether or not these things happen, and maybe after that you can add a choice chapter about how detailed or what kind of stuff should happen.  1 way chapter ends WILL BE EDITED!<br>\r\n   3. Don't make your chapters extremely short or long, unless they are only choice chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I just re-vamped a fair bit of this interactive.  I have decided that instead of those nice, orderly, and lengthy choice chapters, just throw in your own storylines wherever they fit.  Just be sure to leave a space open for more, or I'll make one!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!</td>",
