At least he only had to do this about once a week, and that was just whenever they were due to report in early like they were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cool thing. . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was ignored as most of what he heard people say when in puiblic was, but Callous took a bit more focus when he felt a shoulder rub into his arm. The sort of thing that usually got people hurt, but Callous while violent had sense enough to not be automatically so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, all he did was let his eyes drift to the right and about a foot downward where a redhead was pressing up against his side. She was certainly attractive, although in a more subtle, pretty sort of way rather than outright hot; in either case, Callous's first reaction was an annoyed, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought this would get your attention. You seem like the quiet type. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallous wasn't sure what it was, but his foul mood did lessen a bit as the bag containing Section 24's breakfast was handed to him even when the girl began to rub one hand up and down his chest. \"My name is Asley Sophia Labelle. What's yours, handsome?\" </span></div></div>",

When they each hit the ground with a perfect split, they followed, \"Four, six, eight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle one began to this time shout, though she remained unmoving, \"He is best, there's no debate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three, five, sev --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat came from a lanky man in a similar outfit to the others, skirt replaces with shorts and mask absent; the interruption, however, came from a blond standing near the counter that questioned, \"You four mind getting to the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the girl on the right as she rose from the floor, somewhat awkwardly given her position and slightly muscular build.

Scrawny redhead with a baton-looking thing. Evil cheerleaders, really?\" Ellen crossed her arms, grinning a bit even as water dripped from her hair onto her shirt and the floor as always, \"C'mon, do better than that.

Girls, take off your masks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying that, she gave the further order, \"Angel, you're up.\" At that, the one of the girls that had not been physically active during the cheer routine stepped forward.</span></div></div>",

As always it's going to be Dionysios catching hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sigh, the vigilante normally known as Captain Mercury answered, \"Try not to go too overboard. In this case the only thing he did wrong was --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know - he didn't know that Juliet was trying to pass herself off as a shapeshifter and accidentally threw a guy in the wrong direction.

She would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing contently, she turned to the mirror of the store she entered, eyebrow twitching as she put her powers to work. Various appearences and outfits flashed and faded around her body until at last she settled for the outward look of a tall, blond woman with rose-red lips, sunshine-golden-hair, and fairest of face. Twirling every so slightly, the woman waltzed out of the clothing store, ready to meet the day in her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exitting onto the Atlanta sidewalk, however, a body fell just in front of her. It was covered in bits of rock and stone, all barely obscuring a magnificent, gaudy mask on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got him!\" Cried out a voice. As Shine turned her head, she spotted a figure waving his arms and causing a large boulder to rise into the air behind him. Her disguise faulted briefly but she caught herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it! He's not moving.\" Another cry rang out, this one from a woman. There were four of them. Matching uniforms. Two in one direction, two in another. Beyond them was an entire crowd of onlookers and policemen. They were surrounding the store. It would be impossible to get through without teleporting, but she couldn't see over their heads and find out how far the crowd went. Was it beyond her maximum distance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora began to hyperventilate. Her eyes flew from one member of the group to another. A broad-shouldered woman was coming nearer toward her. There was no way out. They were all closing in. How could they follow her? She was so careful. She wasn't even going to do anything this time.... Why did they need to do this? Why couldn't people just leave her alone and let her be happy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Narcisco, stepping nearer to the body. \"Let's get this sorted out once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce and for all? Yes... Once and for all.</span></div></div>",

Guess what the answer was there. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of how frustrated Sareena had found herself with trying to track down the masked stranger who had repeatedly crossed her, Misty got a slight giggle out of that. Afterward, though, she let out a half-minded, \"Sorry ta hear. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSareena exhaled heavily, then took a deep breath before repeating the original action. \"You want me to try some sort of sleep-inducing spell on you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. . . Do got the day off, so would be nice if --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Sareena's tone seemed to change in that statement, and even running with a brain that had been going for 17 hours Misty could pick up on it. The Black Princess sounded mechanical in tone, although the same as ever in voice, as she said both that word and the following, \"I need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second's explanation, Sareena proceeded to stand up and head right back out of the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Whatever it was, Sareena could handle it; particularly if she didn't ask Misty to come along. That usually meant she was better served staying out of things.

Further, there was the noise of Sareena grabbing her keys as she left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was interesting, figured Misty. Curious on where this might go, she slipped out of bed, dashing as softly as she could toward the door. Peeking out breifly, she checked to see the woman was getting into an elevator. As the doors closed, the lights at the top of the doors pointed toward the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn't follow in the elevator without being seen, thus the young woman turned and dashed back inot the kitchen, slipping out the window onto the fire escape. Climbing down as fast as she could manage, the blonde hopped from the bottom, landing in the alley below. Just in time too it seemed, as when she sped to the opening of the alley, she saw Sareena exit the apartment and head to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was reading too much into this. Maybe Sareena got a magic alert or something and didn't want to worry her about it because it would be dangerous. But something seemed very off about Sareena... Her posture was very limp and slumped over, her eyes half-open. As she headed to the car, Misty followed, her staying out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to get into the car with Sareena without being noticed. This next part was hard, but Misty trained for it with all her years of stealth at Section 24. As the sorceress opened the driver-side door, Misty did the same with an opposite door to the backseat. She slipped inside easily and timed it just right so the two doors shut at exactly the same moment. Normally the driver will look back and see if anything is wrong, which is Misty's cue to hide behind the driver's seat and avoid detection, but Sareena took no notice of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was worrisome enough, but Misty felt worse when the sorceress began driving... and stopped and a Holiday Inn two blocks away.</span></div></div>",

Before the man who had tried to hit her before this could even blink, the floor under him shot up just briefly enough to knock him off his feet; the man landed with a thud to the ground, after a landing that was many things but comfortable wasn't one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Ya know. . .\" From where she stood nearby, having done her part to take down the couple of non-powered folks while Sareena took down the five magic-users, Misty gave a smirk and turned her head up to the watching masked man standing on a platform above. \"This is fun an' all, but gets a little boring doin' things the same way every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErac Day had his hands in his pockets, his red hair slicked back in a ponytail behind him as he spoke, \"You two sneak in here, you do something or other to get through the detection I set up, and you run me 'out of town' only for me to pop up a few weeks later like nothing happened. Why do you continue to follow orders on this from your company, when you know I'm not going to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing our jobs.\" Sareena gave a smirk as she watched from below, knowing the only thing that kept her from flying up there after the man was that he could teleport. Or at least, kept items on hand that gave him the ability to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I. Unfortunately, it just seems to get harder and harder being run out of my covers every time you two come smashing up my gear. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay gave a shrug, and then said, \"Of course, Eighth Sin hasn't found all of them. You all haven't found most of them, even - but it's an annoyance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErac Day, as Sareena and Misty tended to call him given it was his first alias they heard, extended the pointer and middle fingers down toward the girls as he spoke, \"So I thought I would do something about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sareena or Misty could react, there was something that launched from the tip of the glove - it was so small that neither of the girls could tell what it was, but Misty at least could sense it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, she dodged the small needle that came at her; Sareena while she noticed as Misty jumped out of the way could not react quickly enough to do anything to avoid being hit in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a mild pain and the object fell right to the floor, but as Erac then removed a piece of paper from his pocket he explained, \"I know we've basically turned this into a little game, and I enjoy playing with you two. As such I kind of hope that while this gets you out of my way, it doesn't slow you down too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second, the piece of paper went up in flames as Day vanished from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that sounded ominous. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh. . . Whadda those things do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.\" Sareena gave a sigh, then turned her head to Misty and said, \"Take your jacket off and wrap up the two of them in it without touching them. We can rush to the base and get Hearst to look for info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Misty got to removing her coat, Sareena pondered things. As she did, though, she failed to notice something she was doing with one of her hands - and she only became aware of it when a confused Misty asked, \"Uh, Rena?\"</span></div></div>",

Misty had gotten up now, jacket wrapped up in a bundle in her arms as she questioned, \"Why are ya sucking your thumb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stray look down was all that was needed to make Sareena yank the digit from her mouth. Drool had been rolling down her chin and was all over the thumb, but as she wiped it off on the leg of her dress she bemoaned, \"Well, I guess we've got idea of what that thing that hit me's supposed to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Misty stared at her best friend for a second as if waiting for her to say something further. When she didn't, though, the blond asked, \"What's it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSareena's response was at first a dim look like she couldn't believe Misty actually asked that. Eventually, though, she shrugged it off with a, \"Heh, you're such a blond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't seem like she was getting any answers there, Misty guessed. As the girls walked out the nearby emergency exit (quickest way out of the building), the spy questioned, \"So, uh, should I drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'd be best. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only due to fear of what might happen, Sareena was dragging her feet a bit. Misty meanwhile was moving as quickly as she always did when she wasn't sneaking somewhere, so she didn't immediately notice her friend lagging behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immediately,\" as after a moment Misty did pick up on Sareena's placement with her sense for knowing exactly where someone was - though in truth she likely would have noticed even without it had it not kicked in then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo immediate response there, so Misty turned her head back a bit. No immediate sign of the slightly younger woman, but Misty's senses soon picked up on the fact that she hadn't rounded the corner of the building. Well, easy solution there - the blond walked back long enough to glance around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sareena was there, but something was very visibly wrong.</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to be seperated from either of her mommies for such a long time. But on the plus side, maybe she could make a few friends. Her spirits lifted even higher when she entered the room and found a ton of neat toys everywhere, which she wasted no time in playing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes after she was dropped off however, there was a fuss over something at the entrance to her room. Some big kid was arguing with one of the ladies working there. Naturally curious, and able to tell they couldn't see her, Misty inched over to the group to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry,\" said one of the ladies quietly. \"Our room for babies is just too full. We had to call in some extra help to handle them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want my baby sister getting picked on while we're still in town. We're putting her in here so she'll be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty peeked out from behind a tower of building blocks to the people arguing. Right next to the big kid, holding his hand since her balance was a tad shakey was a tiny black-haired baby. Part of Misty wanted to just forget about this and turn away, but something about the toddler just seemed familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll take special care to make sure she's okay.\" Bending low to address the toddler, the daycare lady cooed to her, \"Besides, you're a big girl, huh? I betcha you'll be okay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a burst of giggles, the baby let out a loud, \"Uh-huh!\" before her brother bent down to hug her. As the big kid left and the baby was left alone to be surrounded by older kids , Misty skipped over to her, mainly out of a sense of curiousity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" The four-year-old cooed out slowly. \"Um.... How are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISTY!\" To the little girl's surprise, the baby let out a loud squeal of joy before leaning forward to hug the child around the waist, snuggling her affectionately.</span></div></div>",

Though, uh. . .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little awkward to ask, especially seeing as how the only reason Jane didn't know was she asked Zan to take her shift at the front desk due to a headache, but the girl asked, \"What is it, though?

Why isn't Kodzo wanting to keep that to himself, anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said there's too much risk, and no real benefits from failure. Plus if news about this spreads too far could be too many people trying to claim it for themselves - so keep it under your hat if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the girls and their boss, though, that checking in with Eighth Sin presently amounted to a blond-haired, twenty-five-year-old male teenage girl listening in via a bug in the office.</span></div></div>",

Finally the lights quietly dimmed and a hush came over the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" noted Alex with a sigh. \"You mind telling me what the big deal is about this guy? Didn't his dad also make good cars without all the media circus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the stage, Leonard Spencer made his entrance, waving lovingly to the cheering crowd, a bright spotlight focused solely on him. As the attending press and car buffs began to clap, the two former boyfriends did the same, albeit out of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shrugged, weakly clapping with the rest of the crowd, \"His dad got a lot of press in Britain, but since junior took over he pushed for more media attention. And I think they went with it because he's prettier and cameras love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really get why people think he's so damn good-looking,\" noted Alex, watching the figure take a microphone on the stage. \"I mean, yeah, he's pretty, but not breathtaking. Certainly not enough to make me go nuts over him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he looks good, but I don't get all the hype,\" remarked John. A reporter nearby shushed him but he ignored it. \"Maybe if he got a porno shoot, that'd be something.\" Turning to the vigilante, he added, \"They say he's a really nice guy in real life so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth figures turned, along with every other member of the crowd to a side door near the stage. Standing there was a figure in looming black body armor and a ski-mask/army-helmet (both black) combo to cover his face. In one hand was a bullhorn, the other an enormous, black assault rifle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody on the ground!\" He demanded through the bullhorn, cementing his point by firing momentarily into the air with his rifle. At once, the expo-goers did so, although with the gun, the demand was quite unnecessary. Throwing the bullhorn to the ground, the figure instead unshouldered a saddlebag and held it out. Speaking in an absurdly thick Southern accent, he demanded, \"Everything valuable on your person, whip it out! Wallets, jewelry, keys, fucking everything! I want it in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! Stop!\" As the strange, intimidating madman made his demans, Spencer stepped forward, clearly afraid. \"Listen... I keep five thousand pounds on me at all times! I'll hand it out if you just promise to leave these people alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is Brit money gonna do for me?!\" Grabbing the tycoon by his tie and pulling him closer, the figure pointed the gun into his cheek, \"I fucking hate foreingers like you! Stay out of our damn country, you ugly fucking Englisher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly, Spencer was trying not to grin. The hitman he'd hired was going overboard on the American accent, but other than that, it was perfect. He assured people he wouldn't need security just so he could make this happen. Granted, there was a worry about half the crowd having firearms, this being America, but he avoided most of the danger when he didn't have it happen in Texas. Thankfully, the gun here was full of blanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinobu should be coming in momentarily, \"I-I'm sorry....\" Not whimpering but frightened, hitting that perfect mixture of heroic bravery and humanizing fear, the billionaire demanded, \"But you can't hurt these people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\" Glaring the mystery man shouted, \"Maybe I'll be happy jus' killin' y-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-clad hitman turned in surprise, seeing Starchild standing just behind him. Before he could move, the vigilante easily twisted his arm so that he dropped his gun, and in a smooth, flowing motion grabbed it as it fell and smashed it against the stranger's jaw. He was knocked backward and fell to the ground unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Removing the ammo cartridge from the weapon and throwing it into the corner, Alex offered the fallen tycoon a hand. \"You alright?\"</span></div></div>",

I recently came into possession of some valuable masks that I have no need for or place to put and I thought that you might like to have them. Thank you for your help, and may you continue doing what you do best.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, but okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemed reasonable enough, Alex got a lot of things of this nature from that incident and his records were easy enough to pull if somebody knew and cared who Starchild was.

Finally, he asked, \"What're you doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am protecting sacred land.\" That was growled out in a way very at odds with the cheerful smile on the boy's face as he asked, before the woman announced proudly, \"I know that you've brought an army. . . But I've brought a tool that can take down ten fleets if it must be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat led to long period of awkward stares from the group of kids in general, which Harena judging by her expression - what little could be seen between her hair, mask, and scarf - mistook for fear. It was finally Lore who spoke up to ask, \"Okay, are you suffering from sun stroke or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish, but those in my line train many years for this life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, crazy woman. . . Look, we're just here because our bus broke down and --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will protect the legends under the sands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that proclaimation, the woman came rushing in with the dagger in hand. The first reaction was for Jenny to come moving for her; that was thwarted when the sand under her feet almost immediately dropped her into a pit. Of course, following that the next line of defense was both the second-fastest and the one who could avoid ground-based traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, though, when Grant flew in close enough he found the dagger plunged into his shoulder. This did not bring as much pain as one would expect, and when the blade was removed little blue blood came with it, but the woman explained, \"Now, I take my leave. This boy's curse will spread to everyone who carries the same line of magic as you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second, a heavy blow of wind and sand swept over Harena; when it passed, she was gone.</span></div></div>",

Stomping toward the figure, Bowen asked, \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shilo got pinched!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShilo Gill. An oddly subdued member of Bowen's gang who wore long hooded coats. At the news he'd been taken off, Kodzo's blood began to boil. Grabbing his henchmen's side and pulling him to sit on a heavy crate, he demanded, \"I put Gill on that job specifically because he can stay quiet! How'd he ever get pinched?! Having a bunch of crates filled with guns isn't illegal in Texas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say the cops in Stonewall are nuts though, boss,\" piped up one of the smaller crew members. \"Maybe they was just shoving they's wait around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh... No cops....\" Panting from having run across town, the escaped member began to remove his green-painted bodyarmor. \"Costumes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH! What're they doing? Follow me?!\" Roaring in anger, Bowen stamped his foot, making an echoing boom. \"Was it that pretty boy Marvelous Man?! Bring him on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't see...\" Shaking his head and sitting up straighter on the crate, the henchman began to explain, \"Shilo.. he-he saw a convinence store. Sent me out to get smokes... When I came back they was gettin' pinched. Heard them take the dog you gave 'em off the chain, then the dog just started yelping. Someone tried to run out to the car but this uh... I dunno, it was like a blur... Smacked him and carried him back. Didn't get a good look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Didn't costumes usually love to show off? \"Well, what did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" To be honest, the henchmen was too afraid to examine the scene, although there was one thing. \"Saw... Saw Shilo. Too dark to make it out, but one guy slipped off his coat and hung him unside-down from it for the cops... Then I looked over... In another room, uh... Didn't see who was inside but they was talking... One kept breaking the guns into pieces an' throwing them to the ground. Saw 'em fly past the door. Said they'd trash the whole shipment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell they will!\" Rising to his full height, and even more imposingly, beginning to throw around his full weight, Bowen demanded to the group, \"Get your guns, boys! I've had enough of these costumes running aorund in their underwear and messing with my business! Time to blow those retards all the way back to Georgia!\" As the gang cheered, adrenaline rushing, he pulled up his gasoline and added, \"And if they won't go, gonna burn their faces off!\"</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, one of the men with a trained ear said he could make out noises of cracks and splinterings inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Feeling nice and tough, Bowen turned on his gang, demanding, \"Gimme the horn! Let's get their attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Boss?\" Looking reluctant, one of the heavily-armored members asked, \"Don'tcha think that'll let the pigs know where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" True, the big thing right now was to take care of those costumes... Stroking his cheek, Bowen reached into the trunk and retreived a shotgun. As the henchman caught it, he demanded, \"Alright! You go in there and order those guys out! Tell them Bowen challenges them to a fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Looking terrified, the henchman replied, \"But boss, what if they've got powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phft.\" Rolling his eyes, the figure replied, \"Please. They're probably just idiots with no fashion sense! Like that shoeless blonde Ivy or the prancing-purple faggot Rayne! Get in there and get them out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork continued slowly on the shipment of guns, with Trace in the corner casually breaking them in half much as one would a bagette. As this continued, the other children conversed idly, mostly inspecting the tied-and-gagged ringleader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the figure so he swung side-to-side from the ceiling, Nimble noted, \"Okay, I know you're not into the street-clothes-are-my-costume thing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Civilian Spandex,\" corrected Songbird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Continuing, he added, \"But I like the coat. It's pretty cool-looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate that too,\" replied Cannon in an annoyed voice. \"Oh, just put on a trench coat and suddenly you look evil! It's not even threatening anymore since everybody does it. Not just comic books, everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... but...\" Rather admiring the garment himself, Putty tugged on it before adding, \"It's got a hood on it. So it kinda hides you face and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Grinning, Nimble poked at his mask, \"Wouldn't it be cool if you just put the hood up and then a big mask that covers you whole face. It'd be more like a costume then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I guess,\" replied Songbird thoughtfully. \"It'd make for easy changes to civilian identity since it'd be easy to take the coat and mask off and just wearing them over your clothes when you go out. Of course, you'd need to bundle it up over your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's barely a step over the hat-and-sunglasses-thing,\" replied Cannon with a roll of her eyes. \"Is it really that hard to try to look interesting? Besides, it would be hard to fight if the coat was bundled up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Quickzip entered in from the next room, idly munching on a bag of potato chips, \"Hey. What're we talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trenchcoats being stupid for fighting,\" answered Cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her younger brother could argue against that point, he pointed to Quickzip's bag and asked, \"Ooo, where'd you get those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found a mini-fridge in the other room. Want s-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE, COSTUMES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five children turned in dull surprise, spotting the green-clad madman aiming a gun feverishly at their direction. After several moments of simple pointing and staring, the minion lowered the barrel of his weapon ever-so-slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Looking over the five kids, he remarked, \"What the... Did you guys take out Shilo? How old are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the stranger could ask his question, the smallest of the children there reached out toward him. So far out that his arm easily crossed the long hallway and wrapped, tentacle-like, around the gun. The next second it turned taunt and bounced back like a rubber band, pulling the shotgun out of his hands. That clear, the largest in the group rose her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe henchmen was barely able to notice the glow before he was struck in the chest and slammed into the drywall behind him.</span></div></div>",

We'll tear those idiots to shreds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack-dogs were taken from the back of the truck, and the henchmen present took turns carefully removing their muzzles. At once, the animals rushed out, ferocious toward the open door, fighting and tugging at the very end of their chains, their barking causing spits of heavy saliva. The chains were undone and they rushed feverishly inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there was one more?\" asked Trace, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" Putty nodded, handing the smaller girl a shotgun. \"He shouted, \"FREEZE COSTUMES\" and then he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard him.\" Trace took a moment to tie a knot into the barrel of the shotgun before rounding on her red-headed teammate, \"Andy, when we got through this, you told me specifically there weren't any others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh... Yeah, I know but...\" Squirming guiltily, Nimble suggested, \"Guess I missed one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we missed one, there could be more,\" replied Trace quietly. Turning to the other two girls present, she informed them, \"Look, just to be safe, I want you two to search the rest of this place. If nothing else we could find moer guns or drugs or....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barking reached them, coming down the hall toward their location. Trace sighed, \"Or dogs. I thought it was a little funny they would only have one. Grant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Jumping to attention, Songbird began to move apart from the group, toward te approaching animals. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the canines burst in, tripping over one another to find their prey, drooling and roaring all the way, Songbird too a deep breath through his nose. As they grew ever closer, he opened his mouth. No sound emanated, but at that exact second, the dogs stopped in their tracks. Stumbling to the ground, they proceeded to writhe and kick on the cold floor, whining and yelping all the while. The smarter ones crouched down and covered their ears, while one turned and bolted the way it came, but half of them simply ran about in torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Averting her eyes, Quickzip noted, \"I hate seeing this. The dogs didn't do anything wrong- They're only doing what their owners are telling them. We shouldn't have to hurt them like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that,\" replied Trace, \"But if we don't stop them they'll just attack us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides...\" Cannon rose her hand, making it glow threateningly, \"Grant doing the dog-whistle trick with his scream is clean. Wouldja rather I just zapped them until they limped off like we do with people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of people...\" Trace began to move closer to Songbird as he subdued the pack, \"These dog's didn't just fall out of the sky. Someone let them loose.\" Narrowing her eyes behind her goggles, she added, \"Whoever's behind them probably just sent reinforcements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh...\" Snickering, Nimble inched over to his best friend, asking snidely, \"Time for a good old-fashioned manhunt, Boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Trace replied, \"Exactly.\"</span></div></div>",

We gotta show these pigs early on we don't play no games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I dunno if it's really a cop,\" replied the minion's partner, looking away. \"Just... Could be on stakeout or something. Sitting in his car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Bowen stood up and began to trod heavily toward the direction his boys pointed out to him. Just around the corner of the building was a car, sitting and turned off. Normally nothing to worry about, but in the drivers seat was a blond-haired man flipped boredly through a newspaper. Obviously waiting for something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Could the costumes have a police escort? Witness? Just enjoying the night air? Growling, Bowen looked to his men, who seemed wary. Taking the charge, he marched toward the car angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Banging on the glass, he demanded, \"BLONDIE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it!\" Annoyed, the man inside rolled the window down, asking, \"What's the problem?

You two work on getting that door open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell you are!\" Franklin's current body was that of a college football player, which coupled with his ability to enhance his hosts' strength to inhuman levels, left him a powerful opponent. But sadly, strength didn't account for skill, and even disregarding that, Lore was still the tougher of the two. When the masked man charged, the little girl anchored herself onto the floor and grabbed his outstretched arms, throwing him so hard that he flew through the window to the side. Looking through the broken portal showed him hurled all the way across the parking lot, his fall broken by the cars of one of Ferguza's members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him a little while to get back,\" remarked Trace, marching towards her friends by the door. \"We should be okay to get rid of Ferguza before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Cannon cracked her knuckles, which began to radiate a low shine as an eager smirk crept onto her face, \"Sick of this magician crap- I'm gonna blow her brains out until she admits this is an act.\" Putting her skeptic nature aside, the tallest member of the team glanced down to nudge her brother with her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving stretched his torso under the door to unlock it, Putty gave a shudder at the poke (which was probably a giggle on the other side) and opened it a moment later for the two girls, shouting eagerly, \"C'mon! She's just in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kept you so lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the twelve-year-old could get to nagging her brother, a loud, happy cry came from behind the three children, who turned around at once. The three other members of their costumed team (and the final, uncostumed \"member\") had just arrived, Jake and Songbird turning to brace the doors they''d just come in through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a better question,\" noted Trace, turning around as the other members came nearer, specifically addressing her best friend, \"What kept you so long?\" Quickzip zoomed past her, immediately hugging both Cannon and Putty at once. \"All you had to do was get through those cultists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eensy bit more complicated than that, boss,\" replied Nimble with a snicker, holding his thumb and forefinger just a half-inch apart. \"We're not the only super-bunch crashing the party. A gang came in with matching shirts and just started going to town on everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to hug Trace as well, Quickzip added, \"Mister Jake saw them coming when he was outside and got in here to warn us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't look like more sheep, didn't look like cops, so just assumed the worst. That's all.\" Still pressed against the door, Jake remarked to the little boy next to him, \"Doesn't seem like they're trying to break in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSongbird moved his ear to the door before pulling his weight off it. \"No, sounds sorta like the cultists and Franklin are fighting them off. I don't know how long they'll last though, they seemed pretty synchronized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" As the two blonds neared the rest of the group, Trace crossed her arms, \"They say what they want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were demanding Ferguza for some reason,\" replied Songbird, floating between the Strine siblings. \"A couple of them had some good powers going, but they really didn't do crap in presentation. They didn't even have real costumes, they just all wore the same shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNimble nodded, \"It was less supervillain-team-out-for-vengeance  and more soccer-team-who-haven't-learned-the-real-meaning-of-sportsmanship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever,\" proclaimed Valerie with a dismissive wave, if they're still here once we're done with Ferguza, we can take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Reaching around Songbird to tug on his sister's burnt sleeve, Putty replied, \"Yeah, about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the youngest member's pointing finger, the group found Ferguza in the next room, surrounded by black-colored candles and chanting whilst holding her war wand. Her head was bowed and she didn't even seem to notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Holding up her hand to stop the rest of the group from advancing, Trace remarked, \"Interesting... She seems totally vulnerable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNudging their leader, Nimble asked, \"How doya know it's  not an act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It explains why everyone was so preoccupied keeping us away from her.\"  Glancing over her shoulder, Trace asked, \"Jake, you're supposed to know about magic-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supposedly magic,\" interrupted Valerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of whether the children believed in that act or not, Jake replied, albeit while rolling his eyes, \"Look, I only know about magic from what I've seen in passing. But since you asked, she's obviously working on something big here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo!\" Nimble had played enough video games to know what that meant, \"And we need to stop her before she finishes and kills us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's frown grew more pronounced, \"That's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Cannon rose one arm and fired her blast, knocking into Ferguza and blowing her off her feet into the nearest wall. \"Like shooting fish in a barrel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!\" Now knocked out of her trance, Ferguza rose her head up dizzily, eyes focusing on the group in the doorway, \"You? Oh, God, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ferguza...\" Marching into the room now, with the entire group behind her (even Jake at a distance), Trace demanded, \"We'll give you a chance to leave our city and take your freak show with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOTS!\" Raising to her feet at once, the witch shrieked, \"Do you have any idea what you just ruined?! I could have finally trapped that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeforethe group could say anything more, the circle they'd stepped into began to glow a dark, ominous purple, seemingly trapping them. The candles all blew out, leaving that the brightest source in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Looking about her so quickly her head was a blur, Quickzip shouted in terror, \"Mister Jake? What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN! Get out of this now! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Putty and Nimble by their necks just due to being the closest, the grown-up was prepared to drag the log of them out of the summoning circle. But as pain rushed over his temple, it was apparently too late.</span></div></div>",

At least the kids here were fairly clean in that respect, unlike the average public restroom that tended to come out looking like a buffet at the Human Centipede's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice filled the otherwise empty room again, louder this time, as he moaned, \"God, my head hurts.

And that led to a sigh as he mumbled, \"I knew it, this job's driving me insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that he put his hands under the water again, this time with the desired feeling and no particular sound to welcome it. But when he looked at the sink once more, he saw it looked to be black - and the otherwise blue-tiled walls appeared to be a bright yellow. <br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Jake's head shot up then, eyes widening a bit - and moreso when he saw that his own reflection appeared to have dark blue skin and hair, with the whites of his eyes a solid black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for a moment, though - when he blinked in confusion, everything went back to the way it was supposed to be.</span></div></div>",

It was obvious even without the location and the smell who it was, but neither did much to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in pink turned her head over and up to see Stickset with her arms crossed, an annoyed frown on her face as she continued, \"For all of the vanishing you pull around here, I still see you entirely too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, going looking for a fight with someone who dared walk past you does a lot to make you look good at your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, not a soul here believes you to be anything but a nuisance. Other than those moronic kids anyway, but what do their opinions count? They're just children anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLore put a hand to her throbbing head, then groaned as she closed her eyes and answered, \"Knock it off, I've got a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I'm going to let you get off just because your head hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be nice if you did. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I'm paying you for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what was that? Eyes opening and head turning to face the woman, Lore instantly realized something else -she was at eye-level with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because that little lab experiment made you able to rip cars in half doesn't mean you're one of them, so stop acting like it.\" Stickset moved one arm from across her chest to her hip, as she then explained, \"You've got a class to teach about now, don't you? So get going, and stop causing problems or I'll see if I can't get you moved to being a much-needed second janitor.\"</span></div></div>",

Fine, whatever...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused but not about to show that to the doctor, Lore turned and made her exit, letting Stickset awkwardly hobble away. As she walked, the girl examined herself; she was wearing a sophistocated business suit in the same colors as her Trace suit. Now more bewildered then ever, she began to make her way toward one of the classrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Okay...\" Breathing slowly to herself, the woman spoke slowly, still feeling her adult body. This was alarming, but no big deal. Just think about how this happened. Last thing she remembered, they were fighting Ferguza. That was right, wasn't it? But what happende after that? How did they beat-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Lore?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, the super-strong woman asked with a simple \"Hm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wanna get taken off diaper duty this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..... What? Trace whipped her head aorund in confusion, only for it to get worse when she saw exactly who she was talkign to. Just beside her was Jake. A shorter, pre-pubescent Jake. There was simply no mistaking that jacket or grumpy expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Jewish woman could recover from this particular twist, the little-boy-who-shouldn't-be-one noted, \"I get that Swanson needs someone to do it for her, but I hoenstly don't think she even likes boys doing it. Wouldn't Jenny be better for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had it all of last week,\" noted Jenny, walking by. To Lore's even further surprise, there were a pair of yellow-furred bunny ears hanging from her scalp in the manner of her hopetails. She didn't seem the least bit bothered by it though, only waving at the girl adult with a cheery, \"Hi, Miss Lore!\"</span></div></div>",

In addition to that man Stun King surrounded a short, average-looking white girl, a black one who was tall and slender like a model, and a lanky redheaded man. And they were all wearing identical black T-shirts with #1 on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. . .\" The vigilante turned to where his foe lay unconscious and began to walk over to him. Something about this was making him feel uneasy, but he tried to ignore that as he said, \"I'd love to stay and chat, but I need to get this guy down to the station and have somebody book him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he reached the crook, though, he was taken offguard when a fifth, black man literally appeared from nowhere in front of him, also in the same shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're truly sorry, mister. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a woman speaking, and a turn of his head showed it was a sixth, blond one who wore a sad smile but had a strange sort of maniacal look to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a lamb to the slaughter. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice didn't seem to come from any of the people surround him, but it was a man. A look to the left showed what looked like the shape of a man in the air before it materialized into a handsome-looking man with middle-length blond hair and a brown goatee<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a lamb must be sacrificed to the new gods of this city.\"</span></div></div>",

Wait, I'm a nobody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the apparent leader, with the foreign accent, who asked, \"And we're about to make you a lot more famous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on a minute! My point is. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man dropped off whenever the group made another step inward, but as he circled slowly trying to keep tabs on them all he picked back up, \"My point is attacking me would do nothing! You want somebody who's a big target - and I know someone good for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" That was the bearded one with camoflauge abilities, who had a surprisingly deep voice himself. \"Explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Okay. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the group of seven were willing to wait and let him speak. Stun King was sure to be quick about it, though, \"A few months ago there was this woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the tiny one, the girl with the sad smile, who asked, \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name was something like Fertula or something - I don't know, but it wouldn't be hard to look up, she showed up on TV and everything. She was a witch or something, made it snow and was out for some kind of random or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds promising. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticeably, the foreign man (who seemed to be the leader) and the slender black woman both stepped away from the group then. The woman pulled something from her pocket that looked like a small camcorder. After that the leader questioned, \"Shade, are we ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rolling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.

In this case it was the two blonds, and Grant was the one who gave the request while Jenny fulfilled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a precaution, this footage may be graphic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture cut away from the anchorman then, to a shaky camera right in the face of a light-skinned black woman.

One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera was pulled back from the woman's face then, as she explained, \"There is no two, there is no ten; there is only One. I am One, and they are One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera was pointed to a group of six, where they seemed to have a seventh person at their mercy in a flurry of offense. \"This is only our warning - that man, Stun King, is our sacrifice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a different person speaking, a man; the camera focused on him with a lot more stability and professionalism suddenly present, as he set to speaking with a fairly thick, \"I am but the mouthpiece of our new order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this had the two blonds on the edge of their seat and their friends had come to watch in the interrim, Andy saw fit to pipe up, \"Funny you can't understand a word the guy talking for them says, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, the leader of one group had given enough of a pause to not say further until the leader of the other had asked for silence, \"Anthony Wykcoff.
