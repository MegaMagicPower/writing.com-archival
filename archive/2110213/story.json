I groan and blink at the sun. \u201dMy first order of business is going to be ordering the servants to put up some curtains\u201d, I think as i crawl out of the bed. I look around the room a bit confused. This was my first night in the royal bedroom and I'm not quiet accustomed to waking up in it. It\u2019s quiet a step up from my old bedroom and the bed is so large that I almost felt lonely sleeping in it by myself. This is my first day as a ruler in the Kingdom of Albion, an island kingdom near the coast of western Middle-earth. My parents had died fifteen years before, leaving me as child of one year of age to rule, and I can't even remember them. Of course, I didn't really rule. My steward, Lord Herbert Turner was my regent and raised me as his own. Now, however, I am sixteen years of age and ready to take the throne. Well, to be exact, I took the throne yesterday, after I pulled Excalibur from the stone and was then crowned. I will have big task and many challenges ahead though. My father was an only child and most of the royal family have dwindled into obscurity. I am the only legitimate member of my dynasty left. Should something terrible befall me, the entire kingdom will surely fall into civil war to fill the power vacuum left in my wake. I don't doubt that there are some who would like that more than my rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that morbid thought, I sigh and wipe my eyes before standing out of bed. I walk over to the wardrobe and open it and eye myself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Will you continue as King Arthur XV Pendragon? Or do you want to make your own dynasty with (male and female) a King, Duke, Count, Baron or maybe even an adventurer?)</span></div></div>",

The words are: \u201dIron from Ice\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following members of House Forrester:<br>\r\n- Duke Gregor Forrester (age 47), also known as \u201dthe Good\u201d, is the son of the late Duke Thorren \u201dthe Bold\u201d Forrester, and the head of House Forrester. He and his wife, Duchess Elissa Branfield, have six children: Rodrik, Asher, Mira, Ethan, Talia and Ryon. As a squire in his youth, Gregor became fast friends with Duncan Tuttle, and named his friend steward upon inheriting Ironrath.<br>\r\n-- Duchess Elissa Forrester (age 42) is a kind and loving woman. She is married to Duke Gregor Forrester, with whom she has six children: Rodrik, Asher, Mira, Ethan, Talia and Ryon.<br>\r\n--- Rodrik (age 22) is the first-born son and heir of Duke Gregor. He has a prominent military background and is betrothed to Elaena of House Glenmore.<br>\r\n--- Asher (age 21) is the second-born son Duke Gregor. A very rebellious youth, Asher committed actions such as drinking and whoring which acquire his father\u2019s disapproval. At the age of 17, he fell in love with Gwyn Whitehill, who ran away from her family (an exiled house from Albion) in Bretonnia, and their love was forbidden. So he and Gwyn went to the city-sates of Tilea, in order to be left alone from the two houses, and became husband and wife. Asher now works as a bodyguard to wealthy merchants along with a former slave fighter named Beskha, whom he and Gwyn befriended. They became partners in the mercenary trade, and have stayed by each other\u2019s sides, getting close enough to one another sister and brother, respectively.<br>\r\n--- Mira Forrester (age 18) is the eldest daughter and third child of Duke Gregor and Duchess Elissa. She is a handmaiden to Margaret Rainheart, daughter of the Royal Chancellor Earl Edwin Rainheart, in Highpoint.<br>\r\n--- Ethan Forrester (age 13) is the third son of Duke Gregor and Duchess Elissa. Ethan is the twin-brother of Talia Forrester.<br>\r\n--- Talia Forrester (age 13) is the second daughter of the house, and the twin-sister Ethan Forrester. Talia, like her brother Ethan, enjoys music and often sings, while her brother plays.<br>\r\n--- Ryon (age 7) is the youngest son of Duke Gregor Forrester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Branfields were originally a house from Eastshire that exiled itself from Albion less than a century ago, and became barons in the Dukedom of Aquitaine.<br>\r\nAquitaine is where feuds between nobles, peasant revolts and small civil wars are being an all too common occurrence. 30 years ago, House Branfield got into conflict with a neighboring noble, and all members of the house, except for Malcolm and his sister Elissa, were killed or exiled from Bretonnia when the rebellion was lost. Malcolm and Elissa now live in Albion at Ironrath, the home of Elissa\u2019s husband, Duke Gregor Forrester. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sir Malcolm Branfield (age 47) is the last male heir of his house. As a youth, he often travelled around Albion as a hedge knight, refusing marriage offers from his father. He and his sister were also kind to the peasants, which is unusual among the nobility in Bretonnia. Malcolm fought together with his brothers who died during that conflict, and he fled with Elissa. Malcolm now lives at Ironrath, the seat of his brother-in-law, Duke Gregor Forrester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHousehold:<br>\r\n- Ortengryn, a monk who originated from a minor house in Eastshire. He went to Ironrath to serve House Forrester, where he became a trusted advisor of Duke Gregor Forrester.<br>\r\n- Sir Royland Degore, the master-at-arms for House Forrester, who was knighted by King Alaric \u201dthe Just\u201d after he played a crucial role against a small army of reavers from Albany. His family was wiped out by the reavers.<br>\r\n- Duncan Tuttle, a steward of the house and a good friend of Duke Gregor Forrester.<br>\r\n-- Gared Tuttle (age 18), squire to Duke Gregor Forrester and nephew to Duncan.<br>\r\n- Norren, a warrior in the service of the house.<br>\r\n-- Bowen, Norren\u2019s squire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVassals in the Duchy of Ironrath (so far):<br>\r\n- Gawen Glenmore, Earl of Rillwater Crossing (on southern bank of River Mere, at the northeastern part of the duchy).

He sees himself and his father as gods and the peasants of Eastshire as their subjects. He is characterized by his brutal repression against anyone who questions his fathers right to rule. Commodus is a trained fighter and a dangerous opponent in battle, but his impulsiveness is his greatest weakness.<br>\r\n-- Zorzal (age 32), second-born son of Duke Roose and the head of his father's secret law enforcement. A warrior with delusions of grandeur, displaying cruel and oppressive tendencies driven by an arrogant, selfish, violent and narcissistic personality. He is incapable of any sense of true honor, but at the same time hypocritically accuses his adversaries of not being honorable in battle. Friendship, love and altruism are concepts alien to him, believing that other people exist only to obey, honor and please him, without the need to give something in return - making him unable to be sympathetic for anyone. Mentally unstable, arrogant and vain, Zorzal is a sadist who enjoys committing rape, murder and genocide, and (according to rumors) owns a number of sex slaves. <br>\r\n-- Silva Blackadder (age 29), Roose\u2019s third son, he serves as a commander in his fathers army. His cruelty in battle is only outweighed by his thirst for torturing captives in the aftermath. While his skill as a tactician is lacking, he never commits to a battle without certainty of victory. He prefers demoralizing and degrading his opponents capabilities trough other means before he strikes. While not a formidable fighter like his father or his older brother Commodus, he certainly can hold his own in battle and only selects the most skilled mercenaries and champions to serve as his bodyguard, who never leave his side.<br>\r\n-- Aria Blackadder (age 26), Duke Roose\u2019s eldest daughter, a spirited woman who rejected the social norm of women to act as political bargaining chips in marriage and became a warrior. Over time she gained notoriety serving alongside her brothers, though she found it difficult to understand Silva's sanguine nature. She now serves as the commander of Duke Roose\u2019s guard and his advisor.<br>\r\n-- Cersei Blackadder (age 25), second-eldest daughter of Roose Blackadder, twin sister of Aerion, widow of the Earl of Flayed Rock (rumors claims she poisoned him) and mother of Countess Viola. She\u00b4s a strikingly beautiful woman who is willful, ambitious and has a certain low cunning. She is hungry and greedy for power.<br>\r\n-- Sir Aerion Blackadder (age 25), fourth-born son of Duke Roose. Aerion is one of the most outstanding examples of madness that can hit members of the family. Cruel and arrogant, he thought he was a serpent in human form. Reportedly, he was a dabbler in the black arts. Rumors says he has a an incestious affair with his twin sister.<br>\r\n-- Rhonda Haytham (age 39), third wife of the Duke of Eastshire and mother of his younger daughters. A kind woman who is naive and completely unaware of the nature of her husband, his sons and his older daughters. She once had a dream that showed her daughters being beautiful.<br>\r\n--- Victoria Blackadder (age 18), daughter of Rhonda (her eldest) and Duke Roose, older sister of Rose. A beautiful young woman who has a secret infatuation for Sir Malcolm Branfield (Duke Gregor Forresters brother-in-law), even though he\u2019s nearly 30 years older than she is!<br>\r\n--- Roselyn Blackadder (age 16), nicknamed Rose, youngest daughter of Rhonda and Duke Roose, and younger sister of Victoria. She has a crush for young King Arthur, though she has only seen paintings of him. They even have the same birthday.<br>\r\nShe is very beautiful like her sister, Victoria, and her body is very endowed with large breasts and wide hips, even for a girl in her age. Still, she's shy and naive. Loves to listens to songs about gallant and noble knights with her sister, Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHousehold:<br>\r\n- The Duke's bodyguards:<br>\r\n-- Rahua, a captive from Norsca. She, along with Heqet were in a pirate-ship raided by Duke Roose Blackadder. They both were taken in by the duke. She was trained as a female gladiator, to fight and die in a arena. Since her rescue she has dedicated her life, body and soul to Duke Roose, with who she is madly in love. Since then she has served as Duke Roose\u2019s bedwarmer and bodyguard. She often accompanies him in battle against raiders, seen holding his standard on occasion. She is a tall, muscular woman and her pale body is covered in tattoos and piercings. She favors a two-handed sword which she cuts down men with ease.<br>\r\n-- Heqet, a captive from the far south. She, along with Rahua were in a pirate-ship that raided by Duke Roose. They both were taken in by the duke. She was trained as a guard for a sultan\u2019s wife so she never knew freedom. The only life she knows is that of a slave serving her master. After her rescue, she easily acknowledged Duke Roose as her master and since then, she served him both in bed and as an bodyguard. She is a short, slender, and tan skinned woman. She can usually be seen carrying an exotic looking pair of axes.<br>\r\n-- Sir Gregor and sir Andar, Duke Roose's brutal and terrifying enforcers. Brothers and half-giants.<br>\r\n- Zorzal's entourage:<br>\r\n-- Viscount Herm de Maio, Marquis Calasta and Sir Mudra, Bretonnian knights loyal to their friend, Zorzal.<br>\r\n-- Ramsay, a sadistic psychopath who is fiercely loyal to Zorzal and founder of the \u201dFlayed Men\u201d (named after his birth-home, Flayed Rock), a veteran unit of brutal and sadistic men-at-arms fanatically loyal to Zorzal, with Ramsay as their leader. They all wear the same battle-outfit as he does; dark armour with a red helm and a pale pink cloak. Each helm and gorget resemble the face and shoulders of a skinless and bloody man whose mouth is open in a silent scream.<br>\r\n-- Black serpents, Durnovaria's secret law enforcement commanded by Zorzal, also known as \"cleaners\". They wear distinctive snake-like helmets which obscure their faces, as well as dark purple cloaks held on by wolf's head shaped pin. Their attire also includes brown tunic and black pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVassals in the Duchy of Eastshire (so far):<br>\r\n- Viola Arkham, the 7 year old Countess of Flayed Rock, daughter of Cersei Blackadder (who rules in her daughters name) and granddaughter of Duke Roose of Eastshire.<br>\r\n- Hector Brightflame, Baron of Brightflame Castle and Duke Blackadder's vassal. A renowned warrior who\u2019s seeking glory in tourneys and battlefields.<br>\r\n- Arwood Harlton, Earl of Castlewood (located on the shores of River Saffron next to Sherweald Forest). Sigil: silver tree on green. (Based on the RPG-video game \"Game of Thrones\")<br>\r\n- William Tavington, the ruthless Earl of Tavington Hall.<br>\r\n- Hervis Daubeny, Earl of Borderwatch (protects the northern border of the duchy).<br>\r\n- Quenn Roxton, Earl of the Keep of Chains.<br>\r\n- Hugh Ashdown, Earl of Ironside Castle</span></div></div>",

I have the short black hair I inherited from my mother and the ocean blue eyes from my father.<br>\r\nLord Herbert had me studying history, literature, diplomacy and politics, and Sir Robert trained me to be a good fighter and taught me everything about the art of war, so that I would be having my own command if that day comes. I also hope to be in a jousting tournament soon.<br>\r\nI then pick out a suitable outfit for a King. I must make a good impression at my first day in court. After taking a second glance at myself and striking a kingly pose for a moment, then walked to the table to take look at the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.outfit4events.com/runtime/cache/images/redesignProductFull/501562-2.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.outfit4events.com/runtime/ca...</a>), the Sword in the Stone. The Sword of Power. The Sword of King Arthur, my forefather and namesake. When I pulled it from the stone at the center of the castle, I couldn't believe how light it felt, yet it\u2019s still harder and sharper than any sword in existents. <br>\r\nI then looked at the bed and realized that Geecku was no longer there. She probably went back to the gardens where she lived. I still remember last night\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static1.e621.net/data/36/0a/360a0a53fcfc56ebcf90c62c3991181c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static1.e621.net/data/36/0a/360a...</a>) and Geecku (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static1.e621.net/data/a0/89/a0892d214b464892a8a0adbd4df9138a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static1.e621.net/data/a0/89/a089...</a>) came from south of Narnia, the home of the Furries. No one knows of their origin or parentage but despite their different appearances they see each other as sisters and they grew up together in the jungles. And they also have some magical powers. Thanks to the magic in their blood, they can live on for centuries and remain young and beautiful and both have had over a thousand partners in their lifetimes, and never got pregnant (don't know why). Their bodies seems to swell with the very essence of life, making them immune to all disease and poisonous material that would mortally endanger normal people. <br>\r\nThey both fell for Edward \u201dthe Seafarer\u201d, my father, while he explored the continent and became his permanent lovers as they followed him to Albion. These two females once said that I look like my father when he was young.<br>\r\nThey took residence in Camelot, Zandria in a normal bedchamber and Geecku in the Camelot gardens, and they kept on mating with the king, although many didn't approve. It was surprisingly accepted by the queen however, and nobody understood why. Not even my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria is (a bit) the mature one of the sisters, while having an appetite for sex, she is calm, calculating and serves as Spy Mistress in the Council and wear a specially made dress (she was used to be naked, but got comfortable with dresses). <br>\r\nHer sister, however, is another case: she retains the gleeful sense of adventure of a child and only shows her mature age through a wanton desire for sex. Geecku\u2019s sexual appetite is voracious and insurmountable. Also she\u2019s always naked. When my father died, she started working part-time in a brothel here in the capital and have been mating many men since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria and Geecku were like my second mothers, as Lord Herbert was a second father, and they cared for me. Geecku worked as a wet-nurse when I was a baby and fed me with her breastmilk (yes, magical milk).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was a young boy, I used to have fun playing tag and hide-and-seek with Geecku sometimes. As I became an adolescent, I began to have fantasies of her and Zandria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the night of my coronation, I found Geecku sitting on the edge of the royal bed, in a sexy pose, with a hungry look and naked as usual. I immediately took my clothes off and when I stood naked in front of her, she grabbed my shaft and start licking it with her incredibly long tongue and then sucking it. I had never felt anything like that in my life! When I reached down and touched her huge, soft breast she gets an idea and wrapped her breasts around the 8-inch shaft and moved up and down along with her tongue licking the tip. I tried my best to hold on but she told me to let it out, which I did, all over her face and on top of her breasts. She licked it all off and crawled to the center of the bed and laid on her back, beckoning with her tail towards her. I got the idea and crawled to her and I was now on top her with my shaft right above her lower lips. Then she wrapped legs around my hips and my shaft was suddenly inside her, and I started to move. We kissed each other and her long tongue played with mine in my mouth. And it didn't take long for me to finally release inside her, at the same time she came. But then she rolled me over and she was then on top of me, saying we were not done playing yet, and moved her hips with an incredible speed! How was my father able keep up with this goddess!<br>\r\nAnd we went on for hours in different positions and I did one final release inside her. She laid beside me and brought one of her big nipples to my mouth and I felt a sweet taste from her milk, and she hummed a song and then I was surrounded by darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, so far, the best night in my life. A great birthday present. And I bet it was not a onetime thing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it\u2019s the time to go to court, I open the door and step out. As i walked into the hall, I almost walk right into a serving girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly steps back before the collision, \u201dO-oh, Your Majesty, I'm sorry. My Lord Herbert asked me to check to make sure you\u2019re for court this morning\". she squirms and looks down at the floor politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look her over and recognize her. Sarah, the servant who, along with Dioda, tends and cleans my room. She\u2019s not much older than me with shoulder length blonde hair and pretty blue eyes. Her simple dress covers a modest frame and her pale skin. \u201dI guess even kings run on a schedule. Right?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fidgets under my gaze, \u201dY-yes, Your Majesty\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dRelax Sarah, we\u2019ve know each other since we were young, and i imagine we\u2019re going to be seeing each other a lot if Lord Herbert asked you and Dioda to tend to my needs. If you would like, we could drop the formalities when we\u2019re alone and you may call Arthur\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYes, Your Majesty\u201d she stiffens and a little blush comes to her face at her error, \u201dI mean, Arthur\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle a little at her shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIf you have a moment, would you and Dioda please put some curtains over my window? The light shines in on me and is quiet bright\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at me for a moment, \u201dY-yes, of course Arthur. Is that everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat will be all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah curtsies and walks down the hall. I watch her go for a moment and then I see Dioda approaching me. Dioda is a dark skinned woman of 23 from the Southlands in the far south who is a bit taller than me. She\u2019s wearing an armless dress that shows off her legs and a lot of her cleavage from her large breasts. I had some fantasies of her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI was told that you needed the bedsheets cleaned, my King\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s a good friend of Geecku, so it\u2019s obvious that Geecku told her about last night. \u201dYes, but please be discreet about it\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOf course my King\u201d, and she winks at me before heading into my royal bedroom. And I start walking down the corridor to the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I step into the Throne Room, I am surprised at the number of people are there. Courtiers, Vassals and Advisers. I think that more people attended the coronation, but clearly many of them have stuck around to see how my first day of court goes. One by one they all notice me and soon a flood of faces turn in my direction. I walk up the stairs of the podium where my new throne awaits and take the jeweled crown of Albion (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/61/cf/e4/61cfe4e750fa657b8d24e546c24a794c--male-crown-pageant-crowns.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/61/cf/e4/61cfe...</a>) and set it on my head. It\u2019s lighter than I remembered it being yesterday. Perhaps every day it\u2019ll be a little bit lighter, until I hardly notice it at all. Then I take my place upon the throne. Above the throne hang the banner of my dynasty: a red dragon on black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Herbert, my former regent and current steward steps up. Although, in his old age it looked to be more hobble. \u201dYour Majesty, I\u2019ve seen you turn into a fine young man over the last few years. If only your parents were here to see this day. However, I am here, along with your other advisers. Earl Edwin, your Royal Chancellor, Lady Selena, your Court Mage, Lady Violet, your Royal Priestess, and Sir Robert Wolfsbane, your Marshal. I once again, along with the rest of the court, pledge our support of you and your claim to Albion\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his statement finished, the rest of the court applaud and cheer their support. Although whether those symbols of support are sincere or not has yet to be seen. It pretty much equated to treason, if they didn't at least appear to support me now. The Connor-brothers, however, are my truest friends and they support me without question. The youngest of them, Bryan, is even my first squire since I was knighted before I pulled Excalibur from the stone. And the elder brothers now serves as my bodyguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also sensed that Zandria is watching over me from the shadows (with a smile, i hope).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay straight and stern as i respond, \u201dThank you Lord Herbert. I appreciate your years of service to the crown. Now we have a country to run. Laws to make. Grievances to settle and I hope that your tutelage will assist me in the coming days until I can accrue my own wisdom\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Herbert bows happily before returning to his seat with the rest of the advisers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourt was the place where issues within the kingdom would be brought up to the highest authority, me. Sometimes these issues are just squabbling between two nobles, but other times more important issues might come up. Issue that may threaten the realm.</span></div></div>",

However, my eyes migrate to a small group of people that have nervously shuffled through the door. Their clothes mark them as members of the lower class, peasants. However, they too, if their need great enough may petition the king, therefore what they have to say must be fairly important. <br>\r\nI sat up, \u201dThe people who just came in. Step forward\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a bit of surprise anxiety as they get called out. However they shuffle forward and kneel before their king. The man in front, a burly man with a balding head speaks up for the group, \u201dYour Majesty! Please, you have to help us\u201d. <br>\r\nI lean back a little, \u201dSpeak what\u2019s on your mind\u201d.<br>\r\nHe looks forward at me, a pleading look in his eyes, \u201dWe come from Diocletia, Your Majesty. The Countess\u2026She-she\u2019s gone mad\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognize the name. The County of Diocletia lies within the Crownlands, west from the capital. The county is ruled by one of my vassals, Countess Maria Lennon. She\u2019s five years older than me and was married to a promising noble from a minor family and together they have a little son. The House of Lennon has been around for a long time and while not a particularly powerful family, they\u2019ve always been respected among the circle of nobility. Now that i think of it, It was considered odd that she wasn't at my coronation considering how close she lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man continues, \u201dI have the greatest respect for my liege-lady, but over the last month or so she\u2019s started to act strangely. She\u2019s raised the taxes and have been bleeding the farmers dry of their food. Her men raid her own villages for food and gold, because most of us have stashes hidden in our houses for troubled times. Please, Your Majesty! She\u2019s taking everything from us!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl Edwin, my chancellor steps forward, \u201dYour Majesty, if i may?\u201d. I nod my head to give consent to speak, \u201dWe cannot interfere with how one of our subjects manages her estates. It breaches the feudal contract. However, we may draft a letter expressing disapproval and condemnation for her actions and warn her that the crown may not support her in such matters. But if she\u2019s truly gone mad, then nothing we say will be able to dissuade her. Letters are free though and that is my recommended course of action\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think for a moment. \u201dI could pay her a visit. It\u2019s possible that seeing her king and hearing from him personally may dissuade her from erratic actions\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat may be Your Majesty, but if she truly has gone mad, she may not listen to you, or worse she may try to harm you. I can't suggest putting yourself at risk like that\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHmm\u2026\u201d I ponder what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After court, i manage to flag down Sir Robert before he manage to leave, \u201dSir Robert, may we talk for a moment?\u201d, Sir Robert nods, \u201dOf course Your Majesty. What is it you need?\u201d. I think for a moment, \u201dperhaps we should organize a few extra guards, along with Sir John and Sir Adrian, to defend the Royal Entourage when we travel to Diocletia. As Earl Edwin said, we don't know what we\u2019re getting into\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell, we can certainly do that. All i need to know is when you wish to leave, so that i can make the proper preparations\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019ll be leaving in two days. Will that be enough time?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Robert nods, \u201dThat\u2019s plenty of time. Is there anything else?\u201d. I shrug, \u201dNo, i believe that will be everything\u201d. Sir Robert bows and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore i leave the Court Room, my eyes spot a trio of ladies talking by the door. They\u2019re chatting and giggling among themselves and occasionally one of them takes a quick peek at me. I don't recognize two of them, but the third one is without a doubt Zandria, Spy Mistress of the Council. I note she\u2019s wearing a rather low-cut dress that shows off her large breasts. The other two ladies are likely daughters of unlanded nobles who holds little influence. One redhead and a blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured i could strike up a conversation with her, at least and walk up to her. She dismissed the other two and bowed before me. \u201dGood afternoon Zandria. Did you enjoy court today?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dTo be honest, i find no enjoyment in court\u201d she jokingly responds.<br>\r\n\u201dCould i speak to you? In private?\u201d i asks.<br>\r\n\u201dOf course Arthur\u201d, she still sees me as the young boy who daydreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe started talking about Diocletia while walking. Apparently no word from her spies there for over a month, which is weird. And she even sent another spy a week ago to investigate, no word either. Very strange, because her spies are the best in her employ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked my room and head in. I barely close the door, before Zandria steps in front of me and kisses me (she must have found out about me and Geecku!). Her hands wrapping around my waist. I wrap my arms around her shoulders and pull her against me as i kiss her back. Her large, soft breasts pressing into my chest. I press her towards my bed and when i arrive, she breaks the kiss and sits down. She grins up at me and unties the straps holding her dress up and slowly slides it down her body, wriggling out of it until it falls to the floor.<br>\r\n\u201dLike what you see, Arthur?\u201d She grins seductively at me.<br>\r\n\u201dUh huh\u201d I nod, cock hardening in my trousers. Pressing her back against the bed, i move over on top of her and keep kissing her, sliding my hands across her breasts. While groping her glorious assets (same with Geecku) i started kissing from her mouth, down from her neck to her breasts and lick on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles, \u201dYour Majesty. I have more than just breasts you know?\u201d. I move my hands down and pulls her panties down, revealing the folds of her sex to me, with no pubic hair what so ever (reptile furries only have hair on their heads). I slide a hand down between her legs and find that she\u2019s already moist for me as she pulls my shirt off. After that, it doesn't take long before i remove my trousers and boxers and reveal my royal cock to her. She grins and spreads her legs for me and i press my cock into her vagina.<br>\r\nShe moans and squeezes my cock tightly with her vaginal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tease her nipples with my fingers and feel them stiffen from your stimulation as i thrust harder into her. My cock sliding deep into her wet channel. She moans louder and squirms on my bed as her legs wrap around me and pull me deeper into her. I gradually pick up the pace until the slapping of flesh on flesh and her loud moans fill the room.<br>\r\nShe keeps moaning loudly as you feel her body stiffen, \u201dArthur\u2026I\u2019m gonna\u2026gonna!\u201d. I too feel a build up in my loins as my teeter on the edge of ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria moans loudly and writhes on the bed, squeezing my cock tightly and her legs pulling me deeper into her. I thrust a few more times into her quivering sex before i too get sent over the edge. I grab her wide hips and thrust hard into her as i came hard, my cock throbbing inside her as i pour my warm essence into her. She gives a long moan as i fill her and i thrust hard into her a few more times, each thrust inciting a new spurt of seed against her cervix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both collapse on the bed, panting hard at the incredible pleasure the two of us felt. She kisses me gently as my cock twitches inside her, \u201dThat was wonderful, Arthur\u201d.<br>\r\nI enjoy the feeling of my cock pulsing inside her pussy knowing she won\u2019t be pregnant from this, \u201dYou were quite enjoyable yourself\u201d. I slide off of her, pulling my cock out of her as i catch my breath.<br>\r\nShe wraps her arms around me and presses her breasts against my back, \u201dIt was just as enjoyable as when me and Geecku experience it with your father. Maybe we can keep this game going in the coming days\u201d.<br>\r\nI think about entering a longer relationship with both of them, but stick to a safe answer, \u201dWe\u2019ll see what happens in the coming days\u201d. I then drift to sleep with her wrapped around my torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning i wake up in the same position. Zandria sleeping soundly behind me with her breasts pressed up against me. My cock gets a bit excited and i consider the prospect of having a little bit of morning sex with Zandria before i get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a gentle motion, i turn around in the bed to face, then lay her on the bed, Zandria stirs a bit as she feels my body weight against her, but she has yet to awaken. My hands start to feel every part of her naked body, feeling her assets. As i do that, i lean forward, taking one of her nipples between my lips and suckle it gently. Zandria moans quietly as i use my tongue and lips to play with them, while i slide a hand between her legs, and press it against her folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria begins to stir some more, as i start to rub her folds, and find that sweet nub of hers that is her clit. Her folds come alive in my hand, as it starts to heat up and become moist. My lips lips give her nipples equal treatment, adding kisses to the rest of her chest, as well as her tummy. That is when i decide to see how she likes having her folds licked. So i part her wide open, and start to lick her folds. It wakes Zandria up as she squirms underneath me, as she looks down, \u201dMmmmmm, your majesty\u201d says Zandria giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not long before i plunge my hard cock inside of her, although Zandria is riding me this time. Sometimes she rolls her hips against my lap. Other times, she bounces up and down the length of my cock, letting me watch her breasts bounce freely. Every now and then, i grab her breasts or nipples, or rub her clit as she continues to bounce and ride on my young, hard dick.<br>\r\n\u201dAahh! Aaaaahhhh!\u201d Zandria moans loudly, as both of us come closer to that orgasmic state, \u201dPlease, Your Majesty! Please!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a deep groan, as i push hard against her hips, driving my meaty rod deep inside of her. It pulsates inside of her, making her let go of it. She takes some deep, rapid breaths, as she presses herself against me, as her folds begin to milk me. I start to feel spurts come, as it collects deep inside of Zandria, already adding to the pool of seeds i deposited the previous night. Zandria opens her eyes, gazing into mine, and then presses herself against me, pressing her lips against mine in a hard, deep kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dArthur\u2026.Your Majesty?\u201d Zandria asks me, \u201dYes, Zandria?\u201d i ask her. \u201dI know you are just barely of age\u201d, she tells me, \u201dand that you have only held the throne for so short of time. But you\u2019re already a good strong lover, with room for improvement, as you gain more experience\u201d. I plant a deep kiss on her lips in response. \u201dMmmmmmmm\u201d she moans softly and returns my kiss, before she gently breaks it. \u201dBut alas, your duties call, as do mine. Shall we find one another later, after our respective obligations at hand are fulfilled?\u201d. \u201dyes\u201d, i tell her, \u201das soon as we find enough free time for one another\u201d. I give her one last kiss, and she slowly slides off. I watch her reach down between her legs, taking some of my spilt seed in her fingers, and licks it slowly. She laughs Merrily, Turning to retrieve her undergarments, as well as her dress. As i prepare for a trip to the bath, i watch her dress up, then bow to me, before she leaves my bedchamber.</span></div></div>",

The foundations of the castle was magically fortified by Merlin. I walk in to find the cavernous room empty and strip off my clothes and slip in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wince a little as my skin touches the nearly hot water, but after a moment the warmth of the water began to overtake me. I lay there and wash off, wondering what i should do about Countess Maria. It\u2019s clear that her erratic behavior isn't normal. I consider the possibilities, but most of the ideas that i have are fantastical. Either she\u2019s not really the Countess Maria Lennon, or she\u2019s being controlled by someone else by magic. Both ideas are silly, creatures with the ability to change form are few and far between. Demons won't likely care about a lowly countess. However, being controlled by magic is just as silly. Since the discovery of magic, courts of powerful or influential people have always been warded against such magics. If one was cast on Countess Maria, she would be rendered incapable. A gibbering idiot who wouldn't be able to give orders until the spell wore off, or was broken. People would recognize that she was under the influence of a spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI head off into the rest of the castle. I decided to spend the day helping Sir Robert prepare for going to Diocletia and between organizing supplies and troops, my day is pretty much spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when i return to my royal chamber that night, i saw Geecku making out with Dioda on my bed. Naturally i decided to join in.<br>\r\nThey did a lot of things to me, like; licking and sucking on my shaft together, Dioda riding me (she\u2019s really tight!) while Geecku has her pussy over my mouth, Geecku riding me (very wild!) while Dioda presses her breasts onto my face, pressing their breasts around my shaft, and so on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd through all that, i thought of one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow is the day to go meet with Countess Maria.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After traveling from the capital yesterday I have arrived at Castle Diocletia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't much for carriages (i believe it\u2019s for spoiled nobles) and prefer horses. And after riding by the north bank of the River Mere westward since before dawn, we now look at our destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not an impressive castle and it only has simple fortifications, but it is only the holding of a countess. You can tell the castle had been expanded out over the generations, but overall it doesn't appear to impose on the landscape as many of the more important castles do. The first thing i notice is that there\u2019s not enough people. I step forward and the guards allow me entrance and show the proper respects, but the inner wards were deficit of activity from any servant. I step into the castle, followed by the Connor-brothers and the rest of my guards, and walk in to the meeting hall and is surprised to see a rather odd sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting hall is small compared to my throne room, but it\u2019s completely empty. In the middle of the room a jester is dancing and jiggling his bells in an attempt to entertain. The countess herself, a beautiful woman with flowing black hair was sitting on her throne in a unseemly manner. Her legs were hooked over her arm rest and her back leaned the other arm rest as she lays sprawled on her throne. Upon my entrance with my guards she sits up quickly, an excited look showing on her face, \u201dOh! Your Majesty. I wasn't expecting you so soon\u2026or bring so many men\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo it would seem\u201d, i step forward confidently \u201dCountess Maria. We\u2019ve heard some troubling news that you\u2019re greatly troubling your own people\u201d. She shrugs as she straightens her dress, \u201dOf course i am. They\u2019re holding out on me. Always stuffing things away so that i can\u2019t tax it. Honestly i think they should be taught a lesson. So a lesson is what i taught them. I suppose i shouldn't have let those few escape me few days ago. Apparently they decided to tell on me\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI can't tell you how you treat your own people, but the crown\u2026\u201d Suddenly i notice something off. The jester is still dancing around oblivious to the world, a dull look on his face. Even worse, now that I\u2019ve gotten a good look at his face; i recognize him, i gasp, \u201dCountess Maria. What has happened to your husband!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe countess looked mildly annoyed, as if she was i didn't notice \u201dMy husband bored me. So i made sure that he would never bore me again\u201d, she sits up, a hungry look in her eyes, \u201dYour Majesty, perhaps we can talk more in private. I don't mind your bodyguards normally, but there are some things\u2026states secrets..that shouldn't be privy to anyone\u2019s ears but yours\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe state of her husband and the hungry look in her eyes disturbs me. And i came to think of the missing spies and the theories i had in the baths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>She is not who she says she is</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy expression darkens and i step back a little in case she does something dangerous, \u201dSo, do you want to drop this charade? It\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re not really Maria Lennon\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression turns into an irate sneer, \u201dSo, you\u2019ve figured it out after just a few minutes? A pity\u201d. Suddenly a bright flash envelopes the countess. I shield my eyes and when it clears i see the most terrifying and beautiful sight i\u2019ve lain eyes on in my short life. <br>\r\nThe countess\u2019s body has collapsed onto the throne and where she once stood was a beautiful woman. She had dark purple skin and large horns protruding from her forehead. Her hair was fiery red and flowed across her chest and back. On her back, large bat-like wings protruded from between her shoulder blades along with a pointed tail from just below her butt. I feel my manhood stir in my trousers as I inspect the rest of her body. Her body was completely naked and large breasts were hidden only by her hair. They jiggled at the slightest move. The soft folds of her sex was exposed and she completely lacked any kind of pubic hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing my excitement, the succubus grins a little and pulls her hair behind her back, giving me a clear view of her body. \u201dYour majesty. You don't have to slay me. I can show you pleasure that your mortal girls could only imagine\u201d, she slides her hands across her breasts and moves them down between her legs, \u201dThink about it. You could do anything you wished with my body and i would enjoy it\u201d.</span></div></div>",

You may touch\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited by the prospect, i slide my hands across her breasts, paying special attention to her stiff nipples with a moan of approval from horny demon. Then her expression changes, \u201dUnfortunately, you have brought too many witnesses for us to be more intimate. Consider you touching me a gift to a dead king\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only have a moment to process what she just said before i feel a sharp pain in my chest.

They quickly slay the beast, but the damage was already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Arthur failed to produce any heirs and the Kingdom of Albion fell into dismay. Thus ending the reign of his family and leaving a power vacuum in Albion. The king\u2019s guards returned home and brought the terrible news of their liege\u2019s death with them. The vassals and lord of the realm quickly turned against each other. Duke Blackadder saw his chance to gain power over the realm, but he was not alone however. Every person with an army attempted claim the empty throne and Albion fell into civil war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecades pass before the conflict finally ended. For the first time in over a thousand years, Albion was once again split between half a dozen petty kings, all who claimed to be descendants from Arthur\u2019s family. Until the minor lords and petty kings were slowly absorbed, one-by-one by the their more powerful neighbors and Albion was lost to history.</i></span></div></div>",

It\u2019s also very unlikely that she could take on so many people. As powerful and dangerous as succubi are, they're far from the most dangerous demon in the abyss. I steel myself as i say \u201dMen. Slay this abomination!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growls as an expression of pure rage encompasses her face, \u201dYou\u2019ll pay for refusing me, Mortal!\u201d. She charges me with inhuman speed, her feet barely touching the ground before she takes the next step. The Connor-brothers step forward and draw their swords and block her path, but she lifts her hand and ripple of magic sends them flying, and get knocked unconscious. A third man, a big burly knight that Sir Robert picked himself, charges forward with his great sword drawn. Her hand curls for a moment and i see a purple-hilted dagger manifest in her hand. She quickly dodges the knight\u2019s swing before stabbing the blade into his side. I watch as the knife pierces through his armour as if it wasn't there and the man collapses to the ground. She\u2019s nearly upon me when three more of my men charge upon her. A swirl of fire appears in her hand that bursts out and engulfs them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled Excalibur from the hilt as i lose sight of her for a moment and look to the sides, expecting her to run around the fire. Suddenly she burst through the flames straight ahead of me, unhindered. She raises the blade in her hand and pounces at me. I stumble back and just by luck, she impaled herself on my magical sword mere feet away from me. She writhes in pain as i pulled Excalibur out of her. Black ichor spills onto the floor from her wounds as she collapses to the ground. She growls at me with a raspy voice, \u201dCurse you, King Arthur\u2026Curse you\u2026\u201d, then i watch in surprise as her body melts into a puddle of bubbling goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front of the room, i see the countess' husband collapse from his dancing before looking around in confusion on the ground. Countess Maria also appears to have started to recover as i rush forward to help them.

For that, I and the whole Lennon family will remember your dedication to keeping us safe. Please consider resting up and spending the night here. I know that our most fancy bedrooms probably don't compare to yours, but it would be the least we could do for you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seem as if i have resolved the first crisis affecting my kingdom.

This will be good enough for me\u201d.<br>\r\nShe perks up a little, \u201dThen, sweet dreams my king\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step into the bedroom and close the door before stripping off to my underwear and collapsing onto the bed. The tension of the day may have been short-lived, but it took a lot out of me. It isn't long before I fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s very late when i suddenly get woken up. I'm not sure what woke me, but i lay in bed with my eyes closed. Light footsteps patter on the floor, but i figure they're outside until i feel my bed jiggle from somebody climbing onto it. I tense up my body, preparing to roll if I hear a sudden intake in breath or a knife sliding out of its sheath. Anything that would preclude an attack. Instead all I feel is a weight pressing down on my lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and is quite surprised at what i see. The moonlight shine through my window and shows Countess Maria astride me, wearing nothing but her silken nightie. I can faintly see her naked body under it as the moon\u2019s rays shine through the thin fabric. My cock hardens in my underwear at the erotic sight as she grins down at me, \u201dHello, my king\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit up quickly \u201dCountess Maria!\u201d. She gently presses me back onto the bed, \u201dRelax\u201d, i relax back into the bed, \u201dAnd we\u2019re in privacy. You can call me Maria\u201d.<br>\r\nI look up at her face, resisting the urge to stare at her naked form through her nightie, I whisper \u201dMaria. What are you doing?\u201d. Maria smiles down at me and adjusts herself on my groin where my cock is quickly growing rigid, \u201dI'm simply repaying you for what you did today. I figured this would be an appropriate start\u201d, \u201dYou\u2019re married\u2026what if your husband finds out?\u201d. She shrugs, \u201dEven if he does, I think in this case it is permissible. You did save our whole family from devastation\u201d, she leans in close and kisses me on the lips, \u201dAlso, I took some special herbs in my tea earlier. So just relax and accept your reward\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she wont get pregnant tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will I do?</span></div></div>",

Clearly she just wants to show her appreciation and considering how excited i am about the whole situation, I don't think it\u2019s a bad thing. Maria pulls my bedsheets down until they're below my hips and rubs gently through my underwear, \u201dMy, aren't we well endowed\u201d she slides my underwear down and strokes my cock with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay relaxed and let her take control. The scandalous feeling of being so intimate with a married woman and a pretty at that sends chills down my spine. She smiles at me and pulls her nightie off. Her already attractive body is augmented in the pale blue moonlight. Her large, round breast and stiff nipples all the way to the shadow between her legs. She moves overtop of my rigid rod and i feel her entrance against the head of my cock. It isn\u2019t long before she slides my manhood into her. My whole body tingles at the feeling of being inside her vagina and she moans gently and keeps pushing me deeper into her until she returns to being rested on my lap. My cock fully hilted inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel her vaginal muscles squeeze the length of my cock as she starts gyrating her hips. She rides me slowly, her breasts jiggling a little. She pushes her hands against my chest and leans against me for support. I reach up and cup her breasts. They're a nice handful and i pinch her nipples that have been stiffened by the cool evening air. She moans a little more from me stimulating her nipples and she keeps looking down at me, a pleasured look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sex is mostly quiet, but the cool moonlight stimulating my eyes, the way Maria is looking down at me, and the feeling of her womanhood around my cock makes my whole body feel charged. She moves her hips more quickly, her body burning with her own desire as she closes her eyes and concentrates on the pleasure. I feel her body stiffen in my hands and around my cock as she has a gentle orgasm. Her vaginal wall massaging my cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy own climax builds as her vagina spasms around my cock and i stiffen my body in preparation, \u201dMaria\u2026I'm gonna\u2026\u201d, \u201dSsh\u2026\u201d she responds, \u201dLet it all out\u201d. There\u2019s little i can do as she squeezes me tightly to send me over the edge. It feels like explosions of pleasure are going off in my head as my orgasm washes over me. I thrust my cock up as it starts to twitch and throb inside the countess and i feel my seed flooding into her. She tilts her head up and opens her mouth a little as she pushes down against my thrust and she feel my warmth filling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both relax with her laying against me. My cock continuing to twitch weakly inside of her. She looks up at me and kisses me on the lips, her hand sliding against the stubble on my face. Then just as she entered, she slides off my cock and pulls nightie on and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow fortunate that she took some herbs, otherwise it would have caused trouble!</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was, as she said, a reward for my troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy entourage is ready to leave and the Countess and her husband come out to bid me farewell. The count bows gracefully, but Countess Maria walks up to me and presses her hands to my chest and kisses my cheek, \u201dThank you, for everything Your Majesty\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth me and her husband look surprised by the kiss, but he doesn't seem jealous.

She nods, \u201dI do\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I leave my adventures at Diocletia Castle. It was certainly exciting, but I'm pleased with the outcome. Now begins the day long journey back home. The trip goes as uneventfully as the trip west and I don't make it back to Camelot until nighttime. Whether from the trip, or from everything that\u2019s happened.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My first day of ruling Albion appears to be going quite well for a young ruler. At first, many different kinds of people address their various issues to me, and I do my best to answer them, with help of my advisors. On occasion, an aging nobleman or prestigious tradesman would come with their daughters in tow, offering their hands to me in an act of betrothal, in exchange for favors. Strangely enough, I tell each of them that I would consider their respective offers. Although I am the only descendant of my long-dead parents, and that getting my family started immediately started is one of my top priorities, I also know that choosing the wrong bride could spell disaster for Albion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by the end of the court, a knight steps forward and bents the knee near the steps to the throne, \u201dYour Majesty. I'm Sir Jared of the West and i serve your grandfather, who asked me to send you a request\u201d, he stands up again and brings up a sealed parchment in his hand. I raised from the throne and went down and when the knight gave me the parchment I broke the seal and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt seems that my dear grandfather, Duke George Haytham of the Duchy of Westryk, is asking me and the council to assemble a tourney in my honor\u201d, all the courtiers murmur before I continue, \u201dHe also wishes, as the second richest duke in Albion, to pay for the winnings of jousting, melee and archery\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dHow much does he want to pay?\u201d asked Lord Herbert, and i respond \u201d40,000 to the winner in jousting, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winner in melee and 10,000 in archery. All in Gold Crowns\u201d, I hear gasps and more murmurs from everybody in the Throne Room. 90,000 Gold Crowns in total. Now that\u2019s something.<br>\r\nSir Robert stands up, \u201dWell of course we should have a tourney in the king\u2019s honor! The last time we had that kind of event was over fifty years ago!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dBut I think it would be unfair for Duke George to pay for it all\u201d, said Lord Herbert, \u201dAgreed, we should at least pay half of it\u201d said Earl Edwin, \u201dDo we have enough?\u201d he asked Lord Herbert.<br>\r\n\u201dWell certainly. And we will still have plenty!\u201d. I wasn't aware how well it was in the treasury. But it would very wise to do so. And I think I should add a few things.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd pay half we shall. And it won\u2019t be just for knights or for Albion only. Every warrior, fighter and skilled archer from here and our neighboring lands shall be allowed to enter the tourney too!\u201d, and the crowd sheers. And the Council and I agreed the tourney will begin two months from now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the court ended I went to the library to read about the formats and rules in a tourney (as I always do!):<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/4/44/Mark_Evans_tourney.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/4/44/M...</a>)<br>\r\nFor the knights, the tourney outcomes are an important part of their personal history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTourneys in Albion, the Empire of Sigmar, Bretonnia, Estalia, Tilea and other feudal realms in Middle-earth vary according to the region in which the tourney is held, the desires of the hosting noble, and the rules devised by the nobleman\u2019s master of the games. Many forms of competition are known, including jousting (also called the lists), mock battles between teams of knights, archery competitions, or melee, in which many warriors fight individually in one large battle. Tourneys can be small events focusing on one competition held on a single day, or they can be large events that take several days and may include several different competitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe central event of many tourneys is jousting, in which two armored knights aim to knock each other off their mounts with a jousting lance, continuing on foot with a variety of blunted weapons. The loser of a joust must often forfeit his horse and armour to the winner, thus jeopardizing a considerable part of his possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany tourneys pit pairs of warriors in rounds, where the loser is eliminated and the winner proceeds to the next round. The winner of the last round is declared champion. (This is similar to how many tournaments in real life were performed, with exception of the best-of-three rule). Some ladies allow contestants to wear their favors during a tourney. The queen of love and beauty can be chosen from the ladies by the competition\u2019s victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother format was used at Castle Diocletia fifty years ago. This type of tourney starts with five champions who defend the honor of a woman, often a daughter of the noble who arranges the tournament. Other participants can challenge one of the champions to a joust, and if successful take his place. At the end of the tourney, the five remaining champions either confirm the original queen of love and beauty, or chose a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome tourneys are open only to anointed knights, whose privileges are jealously guarded. Indeed, tourney culture is closely connected to chivalric tradition and its spiritual basis, the Faith. These traditions dominate the feudal realms of Middle-earth, especially in Bretonnia, but they are uncommon in the northern and southwestern Albion, where many follow the old gods. However, the rules for entering tourneys vary with time and place, and there have been many events where adventurers, squires or even followers of the old gods have entered the lists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it\u2019s time to prepare. But for tonight I will enjoy the company of Geecku, and surprisingly, when I got back to my chambers, I find her with Zandria on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay back while Zandria rides on my shaft, and Geecku kisses me...</span></div></div>",

Despite that, i receive word that knights, warriors, archers and fighters from all corners of the realm decides to enter the tourney. Not only that, word of my tourney has spread beyond the realm: knights from Bretonnia, the Empire of Sigmar and Estalia wants to enter as well! I\u2019ve never thought that i would bring in so much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut i have no time thinking about it today though. Raynald Sarwyck, Earl of Riverspring, had recently passed away, at the age of 62. He was a close friend of Lord Herbert, my father and mother, so i felt obligated to attend his burial, as do Lord Herbert. When I arrived on horse the day before the burial, however, I saw something I didn't expect.<br>\r\nAll the times I heard and read about Riverspring, it was one of the regions most flourishing towns. But now I see that much has changed in 15 years. It is now a devastated land and is currently plagued with troubles. Peasants and commoners are going hungry and the poor die of either sickness or famine. The deep misery into which the peasants have sunk and the progressive exodus of merchants and the middle-classes has led the estate to being placed in a somewhat fragile economic and political state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI approached the castle gates accompanied by most of the council (Earl Edwin and Lady Violet stayed behind to run the kingdom in my absent, with Zandria working with her spies) and the Connor-brothers with my bodyguards. The guards at the gates, led by an officer named Greydon, opened for us and let us through. Once within the walls we were greeted by Lady Elyana Sarwyck, daughter of the late Earl Sarwyck, and by her side was her young brother, Gawen Sarwyck, their cousin Sir Ryman, captain of the guard, and Brother Harwyn, the aged counselor, healer and tutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYour Majesty\u201d, said Elyana, \u201dI welcome you to Riverspring. We\u2019re honored by your visit and thankful for your condolences and the Council's\u201d, she and the others bowed their heads and I nodded in respond. I later demanded an explanation for what I saw outside and Brother Harwyn told me in private: Sir Alester Sarwyck, heir to Riverspring and renowned war-hero, served as a bodyguard for my father, King Edward VII Pendragon. 15 years ago, Marienburg (a merchant city-state and one of the largest trading hubs in Middle-earth) wanted to renegotiate the trade between their two nations. Father was accompanied by mother and Sir Alester.<br>\r\nBut when their ship got closer to the harbour, a violent storm appeared. Only Alester survived, and immediately got struck with guilt and refused to return home, no word of him since then.<br>\r\nWhen Earl Raynald received news the deaths of the king and queen and the disappearance of his eldest son, and favored heir, he changed. He began to live more and more in the past and stopped taking care of his duties. He even went so far that he blamed my grandfather, his liege, for the disappearance of Alester. Elyana quickly found herself managing more than she should have. When I asked if Elyana helped her father govern, Harwyn answered that in these last few months, she practically run the House herself. But, in spite of her efforts, she was unable to slow the inevitable ruin of the lands of Riverspring, without a lord. And as for Gawen, he was being belittled endlessly by their father, who didn't want him as an heir. So far that he repeatedly prevented Gawen receiving the rank of knight and one time nearly disinherited him, for no reason. And that was the night Earl Raynald Sarwyck died, and since then, Elyana has tried to manage the lands of House Sarwyck. <br>\r\nBut all is not so dark. Despite rumors, Gawen is known not to be capable of murdering his own father, Duke George Haytham is of forgiving nature and Raynald\u2019s vassals remained faithful to their oath. They all will come to the burial in order to honor his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon I saw Sir Ryman watch over the training of his men. I asked to participate and was allowed to. Gawen volunteered to face me and I couldn't deny that of course (and I wanted to see if he\u2019s good with a sword). We each took a practice-sword and stood ready at the center of the courtyard. When I see his guard being low, I decided to give him a few lessons I got a few years ago.<br>\r\nMe; \u201ddon't use a low guard\u201d, Gawen gave me a confused look and Ryman and the others got curious, \u201dLet me show something i learned from Godfrey of Ibelin. Take a high guard, like this\u201d, I raised my sword above me, \u201dThe Tileans call it <i>la posta del falcone</i> - the guard of the hawk. You strike from high\u201d, I swinged from right, \u201dlike this\u201d, then left and then from above, \u201dDo it\u201d, Gawen raised his sword, \u201dSword straighter\u201d I told him, \u201dCome on. Leg back. Bend your knees. Sword straighter\u201d, and so we began our practice while everyone around us looked on with disbelief. Me, a young boy, training a man older than me?<br>\r\nMe; \u201dDefend yourself\u201d, he blocks a few of my strikes, but when he forces the blade downwards, I shifted the hilt to his surprised face, \u201dThe blade isn't the only part of the sword\u201d.<br>\r\nAnd we went on like this, and then he got the hang of it. And he\u2019s certainly good with a sword, good enough for a warrior. When we were done, i suddenly heard someone say \u201dYou two are good enough. But not against orcs or giants\u201d.<br>\r\nI turned and saw none other than the legendary Sir Mors Westford, also known as \u201dthe Butcher\u201d (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/f/fd/Game_of_thrones-02.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131231034103&amp;path-prefix=de\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/game...</a>). He earned that name 10 years ago, when he and few other knights followed a group of bandits to Albany, the safe haven of pirates and plunderers. There they were forced to fight a whole clan, and Sir Mors fought and killed a majority of them. He\u2019s older now with grey hair and stubb, but I can see his facial scars from years of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Ryman Walk straight towards him and shakes his hand with big smile, \u201dMors! One of two heroes of Stag\u2019s Mount! Good to see you again!\u201d, \u201dAnd to you Sir Ryman\u201d, Sir Mors was also blamed by Earl Raynald and he and his family was forbidden to ever travel to Riverspring. But that ended when the earl died and the whole Westford-family is on a visit and plans to attend the burial (Mors held no grudge against Earl Raynald, or his family), \u201dAnd to everyone here as well\u201d, he then looks at me, \u201dYou, however, still have a lot to learn\u201d.<br>\r\nSir Robert came to my defense, \u201dHe has trained every day and by many knights, including my friend Godfrey of Ibelin, since he was a little boy and he's currently the best fighter in the royal training courtyard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSir Mors Westford; \u201dBut he has not seen war, or has the taste of battle\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThat day may come or not. But i have heard plenty of stories about you\u201d<br>\r\nMors; \u201dLike what?\u201d, he\u2019s getting curious.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dLike the legendary battles you and Sir Alester Sarwyck fought, just before my father King Edward returned from Narnia, and that you and Alester were known as \u201dthe Double-edged Sword\u201d, unpredictable yet deadly\u201d, he looks a bit impressed, \u201dAnd also how you earned the name \u201dthe Butcher\u201d, facing the savage Dragon-kin of Aeryn\u201d<br>\r\nMors; \u201dThe Dragon-kin, huh? Just what do you think you know about them?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dFrom what i have read from books in the royal library, is that they are ferocious warriors and plunderers who are not to be underestimated. And they come to our shores steal food, gold and occasionally women, like the Vikings\u201d<br>\r\nMors; \u201dAnd you're correct. They are descendants of the ancient Dragon Emperors that ruled the islands thousands of years ago. They usually fight amongst themselves, but when they are too hungry or when their balls are too full, you can only imagined what they'll do\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dScum doing everything to survive. If only we could invade that cursed place and put an end to all that\u201d<br>\r\nMors; \u201dBut they are just like normal men, which is why they are such a threat\u201d, he steps forward until he\u2019s right in front of me, \u201dAnd I very much doubt you would survive a moment of battle\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy don't we find out?\u201d, he raised an eyebrow and I said \u201dJust you and me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a whole hour we swinged our practice-swords at each other, with Sir Mors trying to attack me with all the strength he got. We both ended up tired making it a tie, and he cracked a smile and laughed, to the surprise of our crowd of guards, \u201dYou might survive a battle long\u201d he said and in response, i joined in the laughter. After laughing for a while, i noticed a young woman talking with Sir Ryman. Sir Mors noticed too and said \u201dThat\u2019s my daughter, Tya. And here comes Cerenna, my wife\u201d, and he went to her, a redhead women of mid-age. After introducing myself to them both and having a little talk (with Tya giving a special look on Sir Ryman.

Since I'm tired of all the sword practice, I decided to let her do want she want with me. Which she didn't mind.<br>\r\nI took my clothes off, laid back on the bed and she went on top of me and my shaft went swiftly inside her. Her hips went up and down repeatedly and leaned forward to let me suck on her large, delicious breasts. Her deliciously magical milk.<br>\r\nWe both came together a few times before we were finished.

She shrugged and guessed that I'm just having a dream of sorts... Then I suddenly rosed up awake and screamed. John and Adrian, who were both guarding the door, hurried inside and fight the intruder attacking me. But I\u2019m unharmed, to their relief, and I noticed Geecku laying on the floor beside the bed with her legs up, and a surprised look on her face. I also noticed that i was sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn and Lady Selena took me to Harwyn\u2019s workroom. I was wrapped up in a blanket, Lady Selena rubs my back trying to comfort me and Master Harwyn gives me a cup of tea (imported from Cathay). All the while i was still shivering a little.<br>\r\nHarwyn; \u201dWas it a nightmare? It\u2019s not a rare thing and everyone has it. Nobles and commoners alike\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI don\u2019t know what it was\u2026but it felt so real like I was awake and it really happened\u201d<br>\r\nSelena; \u201dWhat do mean?\u201d<br>\r\nHarwyn; \u201dMaybe you feel better telling us about it?\u201d, I might as well do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this is what i told them, and all i can remember:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in the middle of a battlefield. Men killing other men. Soldier against soldier, knight against a knight, and a lord against another. Everywhere was covered in snow, and it was also snowing. I even felt cold. Then suddenly, I saw myself, in a full suit of black armour, riding on a big and powerful Bretonnian Warhorse! But i also saw others\u2026<br>\r\nAn armored warrior with the head of a black dog.<br>\r\nA tall knight wields a greatsword (two-handed sword, longer than longsword and bastard sword) with only one hand, like it was just a butter knife, and cuts his opponents in half.<br>\r\nA knight in shape of a woman.<br>\r\nA man with the head of a red viper wielding a spear.<br>\r\nA knight dressed in red and white, wielding a familiar sword.<br>\r\nA warrior with the sigil of House Sarwyck on his chest, wielding a sword made of fire.<br>\r\nAn archer who shoots an arrow on every enemy he can.<br>\r\nA warrior riding on a griffon.<br>\r\nAnd strangely four warriors who are not from Albion: a viking, a samurai (from Nippon), and an Elf and a Dwarf fighting side-by-side.<br>\r\nAnd finally, there was a templar knight, wielding a greatsword.<br>\r\nAll of them were fighting enemies who all had heads of snakes. Black and white. I then saw a large shadow towering over me. I turned, and look up to see a massive black snake. It attacked me and the next thing I knew, I woke up screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Harwyn and Selena looked at me curiously and wide-eyed. I hardly believe it myself. \u201dWhat do you two make this?\u201d, I asked, \u201dWell\u2026this is unusual\u201d, said Harwyn, \u201dI read about this in the archive of mysteries and magic\u201d, said Selena. Me and Harwyn looked at her with raised eyebrows before she continues, \u201dThere were members of House Pendragon who had prophetical dreams, called <i>dragon\u2019s dream</i>. Some showed a prosperous future, but some showed terrible wars to come\u201d, I stared at her with both amazement and fear. Will there be a bloody civil war in the future?!<br>\r\nSelena; \u201dBut of course, the last time happened centuries ago, so I wouldn't know for sure\u201d, I sighed a bit of relief.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThen lets hope it was just a nightmare\u201d<br>\r\nHarwyn; \u201dI also very much doubt that a viking, a samurai, an Elf and a Dwarf would ever be on the same place. Much less fight together\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn offered me some medicinal herbs that would help me sleep, but I turned it down politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I went back to bed, having a dreamless sleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In almost every castle, including Camelot, there\u2019s a godswood. A godswood is usually a small wooded area within the walls of castles throughout the realm. It is primarily used as a place of worship by those who carry on the traditions of, and pray to, the old gods. To followers of the Faith, they are treated as gardens and as a private wooded area of solitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony would normally have been in Riverspring\u2019s chapel, if it were not in ruins (Riverspring has definitely been suffered on many fronts). So the burial is in the godswood instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is about to begin soon. Every attendant were having a conversation, including me with my grandfather, Duke George Haytham of the Duchy of Westryk. Grandfather is an old but kind man who loves his family above one all else. But i fear it may prove to be a weakness. I just hope it won\u2019t happen. I keep insist grandfather that i would contribute half of the 90,000 Gold Crowns in the tourney. He gives me a kind smile in response, \u201dYour mother and father would have been so proud of you\u201d, he said. And then he looks at something. When I turned to that direction, it was more like someone. I saw Brother Harwyn enter the Riverspring godswood with a hooded, bearded man dressed in red robes and with a sword on his belt (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/a/a0/Alester_Sarwyck.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120608083115&amp;path-prefix=de\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/game...</a>). Must be someone from the cult of Lightbringer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightbringer was the sword of the mythical \u201dFirst Hero\u201d, an all powerful warrior who was thought to be a demigod, an offspring of a god. Lightbringer is thought to be made of living fire. It is also known as the Red Sword of Heroes. The legends of the First Hero and his Lightbringer eventually formed its own cult, which is accepted by the High Priests of the Faith and is quite popular in the Empire, Estalia and Telia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI excused my grandfather and went to speak with the man with Brother Harwyn. It\u2019s not everyday that I get to meet someone from that cult after all.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dGreetings. I am\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThe man in red; \u201dArthur of House Pendragon, the fifteenth of his name, King of Albion\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI guess Master Harwyn here already told you\u201d, I chuckled.<br>\r\nThe man in red; \u201dNo need. You look just like your father when he was at your age\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou knew my father?\u201d, I asked as I raised an eyebrow and looked at Harwyn.<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dAnd he knows you too\u201d, and he smiled. I looked back at the man.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\nThe man in red; \u201dThe last time we met, was when I followed your father and mother to Marienburg\u201d, My eyes slowly grew big when I started to realize what that meant\u2026<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Elyana turned up, \u201dHello member of Lightbringer. I am Lady Elyana Sarwyck, daughter of the late Earl Sarwyck. You are just in time for the ceremony. Were you close to my father?\u201d, and his reply was \u201dYou have changed much in fifteen years, little sister\u2026\u201d, she gasped, \u201dAlester?! You have really returned?\u201d, \u201dHarwyn told me of father dying. It was my duty to come. If only I returned home sooner\u201d, she gives her brother a tight hug, happy that Sir Alester have returned home. Gawen is happy to see him too and hug him also. And then Sir Mors showed up, and Alester said \u201dYou are uglier than I remember. You must have really upset someone!\u201d, to which Mors responded \u201dWell you know me. Always good at making friends\u201d, and they both chuckled and they clasped their forearms.<br>\r\nAlester also met Mors\u2019s family, Lord Herbert, Sir Robert and grandfather, just before the ceremony began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ravella, priestess of Riverspring, prayed for Earl Sarwyck's soul, I pondered. In the dream I had last night, one warrior had a dog\u2019s head, i now that come to think of it; the dog was black, just like the sigil of House Westford! And another warrior in the dream had a flaming sword and the sigil of House Sarwyck, could that be Alester?! This is just getting strange\u2026<br>\r\nWhen Ravella finished her prayer, Alester was asked by Elyana to go first. He is, after all, the heir to Riverspring. As Sir Alester stepped towards his father laying on an altar, I hear one of the barons whisper to another, \u201dWho is that man?\u201d, the other baron said \u201dI believe that is the elder Sarwyck, the one who disappeared. He has certainly changed, but I recognize him\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\nWhen Sir Alester stood by his father, he seems to make a silent prayer\u2026and as he raises his hands, and they suddenly starts to flame! However, he doesn't seem to be affected by that. He puts his right hand on his fathers hands and his left on the head, with the hands still flaming, but it appears to do no harm on the body. This must be some custom of the cult. I heard rumors of members having magical powers. Magic flames. Could they be true?</span></div></div>",

Some of the nobles left to go to their homes, Elyana and Gawen was talking with Sir Robert and other nobles, Sir Mors with his family and then I found Sir Alester with Lord Herbert, grandfather and Harwyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Herbert; \u201dAh, Arthur, there you are. We were talking about the sparring between you and Gawen\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI just simply showed a few moves Godfrey taught me\u201d I chuckled<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dHe truly master la posta del falcone. I heard from a fellow member of Lightbringer that he traveled through Marienburg with a group of followers a few months ago\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dTo where? And why?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dBretonnia. But I do not know why\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnyway, when the whole Sarwyck-family comes to Camelot in time for the tourney, I will personally have Gawen knighted\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWe\u2019re honored, Your Majesty\u201d he bowed<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIt is I who is honored, Earl Alester. I know it\u2019s early for you to use the title but, this county needs you, and your family\u201d<br>\r\nDuke George Haytham; \u201dElyana and Gawen agrees on that\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhat I saw of the town upon my arrival was enough\u2026 It is a disaster. The people cannot go on like this. I heard tell that neighboring earls have taken our people\u2019s lands?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nLord Herbert; \u201dHouse Hamilton had tried\"<br>\r\nDuke George Haytham; \u201dBut my son and grandsons prevented that\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dIndeed\u201d, he said with a sad voice, \u201dThe poverty has worsened over the years. When House Hamilton became aware of your father\u2019s situation, they tried to take advantage of the opportunity\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dBut they have no right to do so. But I thought Father did not want anything to do with House Haytham?\u201d<br>\r\nDuke George Haytham; \u201dBut I still have my duty as Duke of Westryk, and you can thank my son and grandsons\u201d<br>\r\nLord Herbert; \u201dBut did they spread the foul rumors about Gawen poisoning Earl Raynald?\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dNo. But I can think of one possible culprit\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWho is it?\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dValarr. Your father\u2019s bastard son\u2026 your half-brother\u201d, as soon as he said that, I could see anger in Alester\u2019s eyes<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dValarr?! I left Albion hoping never to hear that name again\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI have never heard that name before. And I did not know Earl Raynald had a bastard?\u201d<br>\r\nLord Herbert; \u201dHe got drunk one night and slept with a barmaid, by accident. His wife forgave him afterwards. Anyway, Valarr is a bastard with a bad reputation\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhat has changed? He was but a simple squire when father banished him from Riverspring\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBanished?\u201d<br>\r\nDuke George Haytham; \u201dValarr raped a daughter of a baron loyal to House Breaker more than 15 years ago. That young girl was barely 13 and is currently living in a nunnery and she's been silent for years. Alester was so disgusted and angry that he gave Valarr a scar across his face, as a reminder and a warning to never return to Riverspring\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dNo matter how much Valarr claimed to work for the prosperity of House Sarwyck, Earl Raynald wouldn't hear any of it. He cursed him and he and Duke Haytham here chased him away from Riverspring for good\u201d, he turns to Alester, \u201dYour half-brother was mad with rage, and left, seeking vengeance. And from what I've heard, he\u2019s been a mercenary in Telia ever since. His reputation spread quickly and the heads of the city-states hear of him. In just a few years, he went from a simple soldier to a captain of his own mercenary-company. He moves in the shadows. Merchants and nobles fear him\u201d<br>\r\nI was amazed, shocked, disturbed and disgusted of hearing about this Valarr, \u201dBut where did he learn of leadership? As Earl Alester said, he was but a squire when banished?\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dYes. But when Valarr was merely a young man, he met a retired mercenary-captain who taught him the art of war\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dHe will never set a foot in Riverspring as long as I live\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNor in my court\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Greydon, the officer I met yesterday came running towards us, \u201dBrother Harwyn, my lieges, Your Majesty!

He saw how a guard die, but he said he wasn\u2019t there<br>\r\n- A young man called Small Leo was innocent. The knife he had in his bag is a tool, not a weapon (he\u2019s an apprentice for a butcher in the market square)<br>\r\n- A man named Brusco, a local criminal was, theoretically, innocent. But he deserved punishment anyway for his previous crimes (he was then sent to the dungeons along with Alyn)<br>\r\n- A peasant woman named Mellara was innocent.

Or I\u2019ll break your legs\u201d, Ryman and I couldn't tell if he was joking or not.<br>\r\nElyana Sarwyck; \u201dI very much doubt that it would happen. But anyway Ryman, you have my blessing\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dAnd mine\u201d<br>\r\nWe all turned towards the source, and see that Earl Alester Sarwyck have made a change in appearance!<br>\r\nHe\u2019s wearing a suit of chainmail with leather boots and vambraces, and steel plate on his upper legs and knee. Also a red shirt and a red cloak with the family emblem on them. And he\u2019s got a haircut. His hair is shorter and his long beard shorter also (a van dyke).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after Captain Ryman proposed to Tya Westford that evening, it is decided that the wedding will begin next year.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>THE NEXT DAY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the departure of my entourage, I needed to talk Master Harwyn about a few things: my dream being one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlike the night before Raynald\u2019s funeral, I\u2019ve had the same dream again. The battle in the snow, and warriors in it. I just have to talk to someone about it.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019m certain that the dream involves Earl Alester and Sir Mors. The warrior with the sigil of House Sarwyck and the knight with a dog\u2019s head. House Westford have a black dog on the emblem\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Harwyn; \u201dIt\u2019s probably a Coincident. And like I said, I doubt that a viking, a samurai, an elf and a dwarf would ever be on the same place. And I also doubt about the part with the Bretonnian Warhorse. I mean the Bretonnians never let their type of horse be breed out of their land\u201d<br>\r\nMaybe he\u2019s right\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way home will be different than the trip to Riverspring. The royal carriage arrived in the early evening yesterday and after hearing news my grandfather had received it gave an idea, even though the others were not fond of it.<br>\r\nI\u2019ll take a route along the southern border of the great Sherweald Forest with Alester (he wants to see the state of the manse in the capital and help with the tourney), Mors and the Connor-brothers (my squire, Bryan, and my two bodyguards, John and Adrian), while the others will take the main road with the royal carriage as a decoy, for you never know what happens. I will be dressed as a soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have nothing against a carriage, but I see it as a birdcage. When I ride, I feel free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we all arrived at the main road, we split (my grandfather went west to his seat in Wickford. And Geecku was a bit reluctant to leave me). Alester had no need for guards, while Mors have a small group of soldiers (two veterans and four recruits) under his command: Gorold, a former mercenary and Mors\u2019s lieutenant; Patrek, a warrior wielding a two-handed war hammer; Walder, an old soldier who served under sir Mors for 20 years; sir Terrence, a young knight with a talent for fighting with sword and shield; Ronnet Hill, a former criminal from Morien with an axe in each hand; and finally Poddy, a peasant skilled with a longbow. Mors told me that Poddy was a thief in the slums of Wickford until he was caught and is now forced to serve Sir Mors for ten years.<br>\r\nWhen we started our journey from Riverspring, I found out that Mors have a big and faithful dog that looks very ferocious (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://elder-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/got_dog.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://elder-geek.com/wp-content/uploads...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before we left Riverspring, grandfather had received word from the city watch in Wickford: Sir Cregan, one of Duke George\u2019s best knights, had rape a young boy and left him to die (the young lad lived long enough to identify his tormentor). And of course, me and Alester wanted to help Mors tracking him.<br>\r\nCregan was last said to be heading to Wood\u2019s Mark, an old castle that has been abandoned for centuries. Hence the reason for the different route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun started to set when we reached the edge of the woods and we decided to camp for the night. While the dinner was being prepared, I noticed that the dog is missing.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhere\u2019s your dog sir Mors?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dHe\u2019s scouting the area. We\u2019ve always known how to train them well in the Westford family. And he\u2019s a clever dog\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dYou better believe it\u201d, he joined in our conversation.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHave you been together long?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dYes, he\u2019s an old mutt\u2026a bit like me. I found him in Albany almost ten years ago\u201d<br>\r\nMe; You\u2019ve not told me his name\u2026 Whats\u2019s he called?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThe Hound\u201d, Gorold chuckled.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dOh, I see\u2026he looks a bit ferocious if you ask me\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dHe gets that a lot!\u201d, and he laughs.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow long have you two known each other?\u201d, I was a bit curious.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dSince the battle of Stag\u2019s Mount. A host of two thousand vikings had landed in the north and took a woman of House Brightstone hostage, demanding all the gold of the royal treasury\u201d<br>\r\nAlester then joined in; \u201dMe and Mors joined the host that was lead by Duke Blackadder, who was still the royal Marshal at the time\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThe two of us successfully rescued Lady Brightstone the night before the battle\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dAnd what a battle it was! And even today people say that on the battle Mors and Alester are worth ten men, each\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dTime often twists the truth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dIt is true, from what I saw on that day\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dEither way, we fought together on a few occasions, and I decided to have him in my household levy. And he has proven leadership, isn't that right\u2026chief?\u201d, and Gorold chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we started our dinner, I came to think of a song that me and the Connor-brothers once heard in the capital. It\u2019s a century old song about a king\u2019s steward who secretly visited his mistress in a manse in the city. And I decided to have everyone enjoy the dinner by singing it. I haven't sung in public before, so I hope I'm good enough:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dHe rode through the streets of the city<br>\r\nDown from his hill on high<br>\r\nOver the winds and the steps and the cobbles<br>\r\nHe rode to a woman\u2019s sigh\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seem to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dFor she was his secret treasure<br>\r\nShe was his shame and his bliss<br>\r\nAnd a chain and a keep are nothing<br>\r\nCompared to a woman\u2019s kiss\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Connor-brothers, Ronnet and Poddy joined in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dFor hands of gold are always cold<br>\r\nBut a woman\u2019s hands are warm<br>\r\nFor hands of gold are always cold<br>\r\nBut a woman\u2019s hands are..\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we then were interrupted by the sound of a twig being broken. We all turned to the woods to see two young people in hunting gear. A man and a woman.<br>\r\nThe woman; \u201dThat\u2019s a pretty song. Never heard that before\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIt\u2019s an old city-song\u201d, hunting is allowed for everyone in Albion, while it\u2019s restricted to nobles in Bretonnia.<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dYou hungry? We got some rabbit\u201d<br>\r\nThe man; \u201dwe don't want to steal your food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dIt\u2019s not stealing if we\u2019re offering. Come on\u201d<br>\r\nAnd now we have two more people by the campfire. The man is Garrett and the woman is Misty. They're both from Rottingham. They both soon realized that they spoke to the famed \u201ddouble-edged sword\u201d (but not realizing that I'm the king).<br>\r\nWe all have a pleasant conversation. One time Mors had get sir Terrance\u2019s head from the clouds, as the young knights head is filled with fairy tails, myths and legends.<br>\r\nAnd then Poddy asked if Garrett and Misty knew any songs, and she began to sing one:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nThey strung up a man<br>\r\nThey say who murdered three<br>\r\nStrange things did happen here<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nWhere dead man called out<br>\r\nFor his love to flee<br>\r\nStrange things did happen<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nWhere I told you to run<br>\r\nSo we\u2019d both be free<br>\r\nStrange things did happen here<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nWear a necklace of hope<br>\r\nSide by side with me<br>\r\nStrange things did happen here<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nWhere I told you to run<br>\r\nSo we\u2019d both be free<br>\r\nStrange things did happen here<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nThey strung up a man<br>\r\nThey say who murdered three<br>\r\nStrange things did happen here<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you, are you<br>\r\nComing to the tree<br>\r\nWhere a dead man called out<br>\r\nFor his love flee<br>\r\nStrange things did happen here<br>\r\nNo stranger would it be<br>\r\nIf we met at midnight<br>\r\nIn the hanging tree\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of us were silent. For we knew that song well enough. During the reign of Alaric \u201dthe Mad\u201d, it was a song of rebellion, the people\u2019s weapon against oppression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalder and Mors decided to try lighten up the mood by talking to Patrek.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dI don't know much about you, Patrek\u2026 I hear you used to be into smuggling?\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dI don\u2019t really want to talk about that, sir Mors\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dDon\u2019t be shy, you're amongst brothers here. You've probably seen plenty of interesting thing in your life. Tell us!\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dFirst of all, I was not a smuggler\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThen why the rumors?\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dVery well\u2026 If you really want to know\u2026\u201d, Me and everyone else are getting intrigued, \u201dI was once a farmer, with fertile lands and a family. Just like any other peasant in the Duchy of Ironrath. Then one winter day I lost everything. I was out hunting for stag\u2026 and when I returned home\u2026 there nothing but smoldering ruins left. A small group of seven dragon kin were quietly raiding along the coast of the peninsula, and it led them right to my home. My wife\u2026 She wasn't the type to let herself be pushed around by anyone. If you saw what they did to her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dBloody Hell! Every last one of those dragon bastards deserves to die!\u201d</span></div></div>",

All I could do was take my boat and follow the scum to the pointy end of the peninsula. It was easier than I\u2019d expected. They probably thought they were out of harm\u2019s way, and they were careless. They didn't even try to cover their tracks. When I finally caught up with them, it was dark out. The swine were getting drunk on what they'd stolen from me. So I waited for my moment. After a while, most of them could no longer stand. And that\u2019s when I went for them. First I killed the three watchmen. But one of the rest saw me and cried out. It became a bloodbath. The drink made them slow and awkward and they couldn't even breath fire\u2026 It made it easy for me. I don't know long the killing lasted. When it was over, I was covered in blood, wounds, my clothes slashed to shreds\u2026 I said to myself, \u201dPat, you're a dead man. Might as well let the cold take you\u2026\u201d I let myself drift off\u2026 When I opened my eyes, I was in the Ironrath castle. I had been picked up by rangers who were hunting the dragon kin and then discovered the camp. It took me a month to heal. In the first days, I was accused of everything by the people of Ironrath, smuggling, being a dragon lover\u2026 And I just couldn't convince otherwise. At least not until the duke and his family came back from a trip. He knew my father and he recognize me immediately. Once I healed up, I left Ironrath, and a month ago I became a man-at-arms for House Westford\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou've nearly suffered an injustice, but you were right to serve sir Mors\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dIncredible! I didn't know a killer like you was one of our recruits!\u201d, Gorold and Ronnet was also impressed.<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dWhat about you, Walder, how did you end up serving sir Mors?\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dHm\u2026 Let me think about it for a minute. Where to begin\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dI think I know what you want to talk about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dSay nothing, Mors, you'll spoil the surprise. You see my necklace Patrek?\u201d, the necklace was a religious symbol, \u201dthe High Priest gave it to me personally\u201d, it surprises everyone but Mors (I guess he already knew).<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dThe High Priest? The head of the Faith? You must be joking!\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dI swear it\u2019s true!\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dHe\u2019s right, but I'm not sure you all really want to hear the story\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dOn the contrary. I would like to hear it\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dMe too\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dVery well\u201d, everyone, including me, Garrett and Misty, are very intrigued to hear, \u201dI had a simple and poor life\u2026 like you, Patrek. Much like any other peasant in the Empire of Sigmar, you might say\u201d, the fact that he\u2019s from the empire surprises us a bit.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou're from the mightiest nation of Middle Earth? But what about your accent? I mean you speak like you were born here!\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dI easily adapt. And I also lived just a few days from Altdorf, so I occasionally trade with a few merchants and a few eagerly taught me their tongue. Now please let me go on\u201d, we kept silent, \u201dI had a wife, Shorei. She was delicate and buxom, even by empire standards, always smiling, a good woman\u2026 never complained without good reason. She was devoted to the Faith and always ready to aid her neighbor\u2026 The best day in my life was the day she agreed to marry! But all good things come to an end\u2026 She fell ill while with child. I sold everything to pay for her treatment\u2026 my livestock, my fields and even my home. All that only to be sold false remedies by swindlers preying on my love! When I finally figured out what they were doing, I pounced on two of the filthy whoresons and gave them what they deserved. I beat them bloody, and took my time over it too\u201d, I was honestly shocked by hearing this.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dYou chose your destiny, as we did ours\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dI wasn't expecting that from you Walder\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dI had mistaken you for skilled thief\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dIt would have been better if I was. I probably wouldn't be here now\u2026 I spent twenty years of my life serving sir Mors and unlike you, if I had to do it all again, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMisty; \u201dSo that\u2019s when they caught you?\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dNo, no. Let me finish\u2026 Shorei held out until the end of her pregnancy, so that the child could survive\u2026 She suffered more than I imagined possible. The day she went into labor, I was alone with her. Giving birth to our daughter was to much strain. It killed her. I buried her that same evening\u201d, just like my grandmother when gave birth to father, \u201dI wanted a better life for my little girl, a different life\u2026 I swore by the gods that she wouldn't end up like her mother, that she would only have the best\u2026 the following day, I left home carrying what was left of my possessions on my back, to baptize my little girl into the Faith. I walked for more than three days, feeding my little girl as I could, and praying each day that she would survive\u2026 I eventually reached the city, I knelt before the wondrous gold and crystal dome of the Great Temple\u2026 Once inside, an old priest welcomed me. I told my story\u2026 I confessed everything. He listened attentively. I cried on his shoulder, and he comforted me with soothing words. Afterwards he took my daughter in for observation\u2026 He asked a servant to bring him some goat\u2019s milk, and that\u2019s when I understood\u2026 That old man wasn't just a priest, he was the high priest himself\u201d<br>\r\nMisty; \u201dReally?\u201d, she really has a hard time to believe it.<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dYes\u2026 He said if I served a lord in one of the neighboring realms, they would find a good family who would take care my daughter. He would personally ensure that she\u2019d have a good life\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dAnd you left the Empire, just like that?\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dThat\u2019s right\u2026 I gave them my little girl and left for Albion, as Bretonnia was out of the question. Before I left, the High Priest personally gave me this necklace. For me, it represents my absolution\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dQuiet a story!\u201d, it has indeed touched many of us. I even saw Ronnet shed a tear.<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dYeah\u2026 I suppose so. But yours wasn't too bad, either\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dEach and every man has his tale to tell, and none of them are enviable\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dWhat about you, Mors? What\u2019s you story?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dMaybe another time, Patrek. Now I'm curious about our two guests here\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dMe too. Why are you two so far from Rottingham?\u201d<br>\r\nGarrett; \u201dTo get away from the sheriff. He\u2019s a greedy arse\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\nMisty; \u201dThere\u2019s much you don't know\u201d, She and Gale stands up, \u201dnow if you excuse us, we\u2019d like to be on our way\u201d<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dWait. Aren't there monsters in the woods?\u201d<br>\r\nGarrett; \u201dDon\u2019t believe anything you hear. And We met some pixies looking for a potential mate\u201d, and they walked away, and Ronnet then took a straight walk to the woods. Maybe there really are Faeries in Sherweald Forest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnet came back later in the evening, walking like he\u2019s got kicked on the balls. When anyone tries to ask, he just mutters and goes inside his tent. Later after that, I was sitting by the fire with Earl Alester and Gorold, who both have the first watch tonight.<br>\r\nI cursed myself, but I had to ask.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dGorold\u2026 What really happened in Albany?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dI tried to ask Mors, but he wouldn't talk\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAll everyone knows is that he fought a small army singlehanded\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dNot far from it\u201d, he seemed reluctant, \u201dyou're my king and you are an old friend of Mors, so neither of you will tell this to no-one. Understand? Swear to it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter me and Alester had sworn, he began to tell the tale of \u201dthe Butcher\u201d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 years ago, in the winter, Mors and Gorold were sent to the northern coast of Morien, accompanied by a builder named Maekar, an immigrant from the Empire of Sigmar, and a mercenary called Weasel. Maekar was to help with a construction of a palisade in a village\u2026 then the Dragon-kin came and abducted many people, including Maekar.<br>\r\nDespite objections from their lieges, Mors, Gorold and Weasel took a boat and traveled to Aeryn, where the reavers came\u2026<br>\r\nWhen they arrived they camped for the night next to the beach\u2026 but in the morning, Mors and Gorold were captured by the same clutch that took Maekar, led by a wild chieftain named Bael. Weasel had met Bael in the past, and Weasel had promised to bring him good fighters.<br>\r\nBael forces Mors and Gorold to take part in his pit fights. Mors meets his dog there, who is also forced to fight.<br>\r\nThey were there for days.<br>\r\nAfter Mors and Gorold make an unpopular decision in the pits, a small Dragon-kin, presumably angry at losing his wager, breaks into Mors\u2019 cage to kill him, but Mors\u2019 dog kills him. This enables Mors to find Gorold and escape the camp. However, Mors insisted that they find Maekar first. Maekar is found to have his arms and legs removed, and reveals that he and other captives were taken to provide meat to feed the pit fighters. He asked Mors to kill him out of mercy.<br>\r\nThey both heard a horn in the distant, meaning that a rescue party had landed to search for them. Mors ordered Gorold to bring reinforcements, while he fights the whole clutch.<br>\r\nGorold came back with the party, only to find Bael, Weasel and all the warriors in the entire encampment massacred. One soldier commented that it is \u201dlike a slaughterhouse\u201d, and Gorold, finding Mors sitting next to a pile of bodies, replied \u201dAye\u2026 And there\u2019s the butcher\u201d, giving Mors his nickname.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hard to imagine anyone going through what Mors and Gorold did. Can\u2019t even imagine myself in the same situation. Would I ever be able to handle a fight in the field?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway I got out of my tent, passing sir Terrance and Poddy (who both have the current watch), and into the woods to pee behind the trees. When I was done, however, I heard someone giggle. I have my sword with me so I decided to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking a bit deeper in the forest, I saw her. A tree nymph! She is a tall slender young woman with long flowing hair, olive skin and one of the most spectacular pair of bosoms I\u2019ve ever seen (including Geecku\u2019s and Zandria\u2019s)! Dressed in a figure hugging summer dress, made of forest green leafs, that sets of her slender frame, her glorious breasts threatens slip free from the flimsy dress all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approaches me while moving her hips sideways. And before I knew it, she leaps out, wrap her arms around my neck and forces a kiss on my lips. I knew what she wanted from me, what all Fae-females wants from human men: babies. Not enough male Faeries are born so the females hunt male humans so they could hopefully have male babies. And who am I to deny her that? Besides, her smell and the huge breasts that presses against my chest are making me crazy with lust!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrap my own arms around her waist and pulling her closer while sneaking a tongue into her mouth, and she moans in delight. We keep on kissing each other while I use one hand to squeeze her lovely ass and she is wrapping her long bare leg behind me, pulling me tight against her soft eager body. And she could my manhood getting really hard, or as some human jokers called \u201dgetting wood\u201d, and I bet she likes that term a lot. Then she couldn't take it anymore as she lets her dress fall down to the ground and I decided to take off my own clothes, and she eagerly helps out. As we both are now naked, I can\u2019t take my eyes off her two inhumanly perfect orbs of softly tanned olive flesh, as big as Estalian cantaloupe melons (they're huge!) and as pliant as pillows. They sat full and high on her chest with no hint of sagging or age, bouncing gently with each quickening breath she took. I couldn't tear my eyes from them\u2026<br>\r\nAnd it\u2019s no secret that the Fae girls, like the Furry girls, take pride on their breasts, as they attract men easily. And this nymph is certainly enjoying the attention her breasts are getting from me starring at them.<br>\r\nAs for the rest of her body: her long dark hair flowing with streaks amber, gold and all of autumn\u2019s colors across her shoulders and breasts like cascading water. Her skin was flawless and gently sun-kissed, her body all slender lines and deliciously inviting curves. My eyes move down, past her extraordinary cleavage, across her smooth belly and tiny hourglass waist, over her round jutting hips to where her long impossibly smooth long legs joined at her womanhood. A small patch of amber hair there, shaped like a rose leaf, seems to point down at the soft pink lips of her pussy like an arrow, as if directing my steely prick to where it belonged.<br>\r\nShe grab my head with both hands and gently pulled it into her deep cleavage. She then began to stroke my throbbing cock with one hand while rubbing my head with the other, as I enjoy having my head between her breasts and gropes her ass greedily with both hands. And they are amazing too! Toned, round and deliciously full in my hungry grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to make the next move and lifted her up and let her wrap both her legs around my waist. She as light as a child in my arms and I keep kneading and groping her amazing ass feverishly as she grasps my shoulders and arches her back in pleasure of my touch.<br>\r\nHer bulging milkers wobble and bounce before my eyes as she thrusts up and once again bury my face between their immense softness before finding a hard pink nipple to latch onto. Suckling like a newborn baby, I make her gasp sharply (very sensitive I'm guessing).<br>\r\nShe quivers in delight as I run my tongue over her nipple and suck it back between my lips again, distending her huge soft tit as I pull at it with my mouth. Her hips begin to shift and move with her need for my cock and I pause in my suckling just long enough to position my aching boner at the entrance to her pussy. She doesn't even wait for me to push up into her: with blissful sigh she lowers herself smoothly down the length of my meaty lance taking me fully into her tight fleshy folds.<br>\r\nAgain she\u2019s wrapping her arms around my neck and burying my face even deeper into her spectacular cleavage while she moans with pleasure.<br>\r\nI just grunt as I thrust myself up into her astonishingly tight love-box. Shit, but I never thought it would feel like this! Her cunt is slick with her juices and it seems to suck at my throbbing tool as if trying to draw it deeper towards her waiting womb. So warm and so damn tight\u2026 I grab the magnificent nymph\u2019s slender thighs and begin lifting her delightfully light naked form up and down, bouncing her wildly on my ragingly hard cock. Gravity does much for me, her own light weight is enough to impale her completely on my pulsing tool each time I drop her back onto it. She begins to grind her slick cunt up against my pelvis each time she takes in my full length and the ferocity of both of our movements echoes through the woods with a wet slapping noise of flesh meeting flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymph\u2019s breath is coming in sharp gasps when her whole body starts to quiver in my grasp.<br>\r\nThe busty Fae squealed throwing her head back in the throes of a mind splitting orgasm. Her mouth moves wordlessly, her emerald eyes roll and her enormous knockers careen wildly on her chest as I continue to jack-hammer her up and down on my unyielding manhood, reveling in the feel of her magical pussy stretched taut around around my turgid thrusting man-meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGods, it\u2019s good to be the king! I snare one of the bouncing knockers with my mouth again, pressing my face into the miraculously soft yielding flesh of the tit and roll my tongue around the hard peak of her long nipple making her gasp desperately for breath.<br>\r\nOne final thought flitters across my mind as I feel my balls heave and my cock explode deep into her waiting womb\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026It IS good to be the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final incoherent shriek of pleasure, her body stiffens against mine in one final monumental climax as I spurt load after heavy load of seed deep into her throbbing womb. I remember releasing this much in Geecku and Zandria, and this sensation of it nearly makes my knees wobble. Her pussy seems to ripple around my erupting shaft, as though milking it for every last drop inside of me and her long legs locked around my waist don't ease their grip on my pelvis for an instant as she quivers through the last throws of her orgasmic climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself panting a little as she finally begins to relax her clinging grip on me, so I let my knees move down until they reach the soft grass-covered ground with her in my lap, my cock softening inside her. Flicking a silken strand of hair aside she looks at me, her large green eyes glancing coyly through those long sensual lashes, and she smiles with genuine affection before kissing me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we hear someone giggle. A tiny sparkling showed up, only to materialize in a burst of faerie dust into a full sized Fae girl: slender and beautiful with long multicolored hair, pointed ears and dragonfly-like wings. A pixie. And she\u2019s completely naked! Long delicate limbs, trim waist, tight rounded ass and flat belly, but her breasts\u2026 Two flawless soft globes, bigger than the nymph\u2019s, that sat high and proudly on her chest.<br>\r\nPixies are not only known to be prone to their mischievous and impulsive behavior, but they are also especially sensitive to human lusts and desires. Most of her kind who make their way to human settlements near forests had found satisfying careers as whores in the Empire, reveling joyfully in abundance of lust, sex and human men to fill their bellies with the half-Fae children they so madly craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nymph feels my wood getting hard again, she smiles at her pixie friend before shifting her spectacularly round hips to let my cock free of her soft silky folds. The pixie steps toward me and then pushes me to the ground, and the nymph moves down and gave me a long lingering kiss, her tongue darting sweetly into my mouth, before she sits up and watch as her friend is stroking my shaft.<br>\r\nThe pixie then move to straddle on my lap. I let out a small moan of anticipation as her wet pussy lips teasingly licked the tip of my cock head.<br>\r\nGrinning at my approval, the pixie eased down on my cock, her pussy slowly engulfing my shaft whole. She rested her hands on my chest for support - her arms squeezing her huge breasts together as a result - as she began rocking back and forth.<br>\r\nNow I let out a loud moan and put both my hands on her hips. I can't get my eyes of the pixie\u2019s bouncing, jiggling and wobbling tits as she moves her hip with an increasing speed. The nymph was sitting close by and has one on breast and another touching her pussy.<br>\r\nThe pixie then leans down and presses her lips on mine, forcing her tongue in. I kissed her back with an equal passion, before kissing her down from her neck, to her massive cleavage, while she\u2019s entwining her nimble fingers together behind my neck, and drew my head deeper in, muffling my hungry moans in her bountiful bouncers. I started licking the inside of the cleavage, on her tits, until I found a hard nipple and took it into my mouth, with the pixie pulling me onto her tit encouraging me to suck on it, which I gladly did.<br>\r\nMy cock squirmed within her and I thrusts my hips upward burying my cock deeper into her hot tight box, while she keeps having an orgasm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, as she\u2019s getting close to her third orgasm, I was getting close too. The pixie knew this and she leaned up again to have her hand on my chest again and rock her hips faster. I then noticed the nymph laying down next to me, with her tits close to my face and I took a nipple to suck and she moans approvingly.<br>\r\nAnd when the pixie made her third, I exploded deep into her womb. I just keep spurting much seed in her, until I finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymph took out my cock and licked and sucked of our combined juices while the pixie laid beside me and kissing me madly. The nymph moved back up on my side and grab my head to kiss me too, leading to a playful kissing contest between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I heard a rough \u201dAhem!\u201d. I sat up, only to see sir Mors Westford standing behind me with his dog by his side.<br>\r\nOne look from him was enough for the two Fae girls to give me one last kiss before the nymph slipped back into her green leaf dress. I watch with astonishment as, with a few simple adjustments to her hair and dress, she looks as unruffled and beautiful as when I first met her. She certainly didn't look like someone who had just screwed the brains out of a young king dressed as a soldier! The pixie took her hand and they both blew me a goodbye kiss before they turn into tiny sparkles and disappear into the night.<br>\r\nI look back at Mors who is waiting for me to dress up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done dressing up and strapping Excalibur back on the hip, we started to walk back to the camp.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow did you find me?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dMy dog here woke me up and when I found your tent empty and the hound pointed his nose at the woods, I figured that some Fae girls are having their way with you\u201d, I blush heavily hearing that.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSir Mors\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dRelax, Your Majesty. The Fae are desperate for babies and those two were lucky to find a king. They could smell it on you. And you're not the first of the Pendragons to fuck a Fae. Your ancestor, Alaric \u201dthe Mad\u201d, took a pixie for a queen and her sisters for concubines. \u201dThe pixie queen\u201d was the only one to give a boy, which would explain a Pendragon's endurance and recovery in bed. A bit of Fae magic is in your blood\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI have a feeling that a \u201dbut\u201d is coming up\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThe children with Faeries will have no interest or claim the throne and will be accepted in Fae society, and fucking with the lizard girls will guarantee no bastards. But\u2026 you've got to be careful with your interest in women and keep you urges in check. And as a king you have responsibilities. You have to marry. You understand why?\u201d, he looks at me sternly.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI do. A king needs a queen, and to further the family-line. But if I choose the wrong bride, the realm might suffer for it\u201d<br>\r\nSir Mors nodded in agreement as we entered the camp. Ronnet and Patrek had the watch. And Ronnet immediately knew what I\u2019ve doing in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur company continued on after breakfast, we\u2019ll be reaching Wood\u2019s Mark by nightfall.<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dHow is it that the Fae girls fuck you and not me?!\u201d, many people like to think that the Fae mate with EVERYONE.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThat probably figured out, by your scent, that you like to fuck a bit too rough\u201d, sir Terrance, Poddy, Walder, Patrek and the Connor-brothers laughed while Ronnet decided not to argue with the king.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIf you don't mind me asking Your Majesty\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYes, Alester?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhat kind of king do you hope to be?\u201d, everyone looked at him skeptically, like \u2019what do you mean by that?\u2019. But I knew what he\u2019s talking about.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou're referring to the riots, are you? About me wanting to help you\u2026 and the Fae girls I was with last night?\u201d, he nodded. I sighed before answering, \u201da good king. A better king than the tyrants who brought shame to the name Pendragon\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dMm, I think so as well\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dBut what makes a good king?\u201d, he turned to the rest, \u201dHmm? What is a good king\u2019s single most important quality?\u201d<br>\r\nAll began to think, until Walder guessed \u201dholiness?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHmm. Allan \u201dthe Blessed\u201d was holy. And pious. He built a cathedral in each of the cities of Camelot, Durnovaria and Wickford\u2026 He also named a six-year-old boy a Royal priest because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this was sinful\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dJustice\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was Just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike\u2026 But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year, by his own brother. Alaric \u201dthe Mad\u201d. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201d\u2026No\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNo\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dWhat about Strength?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYes. Strength. King Robert \u201dthe Boar\u201d was strong. He won a civil war against his cousin and crushed every rebellion against him. And he attended three Council meetings in his 17-year-reign. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?\u201d Mors\u2019 men tried to think of an answer, when my squire, Bryan Connor, said \u201dwisdom\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYes!\u201d<br>\r\nBryan Connor; \u201dWisdom is what makes a good king\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dYes. But what is wisdom? Hmm?\u201d, he decided to try this: \u201dA house with fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn\u2019t? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNo. Of course not\u201d I said with a smile, \u201dBut I'm trying to learn more of it though. And a wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn\u2019t. I'm young, I know that. But, a wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards, until the day he dies\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody agreed that I was wise saying that\u2026</span></div></div>",

Earl Alester, when will you decide to marry?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dBrother Harwyn is probably trying to find a suitable wife for me\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI have nothing against Gawen, but you need to have an heir, like I do\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIf I may add, Your Majesty, who do you have in mind\u201d, that question really made me think hard about it.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe Duke of Eastshire hasn't been seen outside the region for fifteen years, still holding grudge against the Council I guess. So I thought that in order to make good terms with his house, I marry one of his youngest daughters, who are also my cousins, and granddaughters of my grandfather, Duke George Haytham\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dI\u2019d advise you not to trust that man, for he has no honor\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI honestly don't know much about him. You knew him?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dHe is so merciless that a song were made for his cruelty\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThe Rains of Castamere\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI thought there were lions in it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThat\u2019s what they what everyone to think, but Roose is more snake than lion\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dHis house had good times and bad like the rest in the realm\u2026 but the worst time was during the reign of his father, Tytos Blackadder\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dAn amiable and jovial gentleman in his youth, he was called \u201dthe Laughing Adder\u201d prior to the death of his beloved wife, Roose\u2019s mother. However, he was also weak willed, eager to please, slow to anger, quick to forgive, and too trusting by half. He saw the good in everyone, great and small, but this trust blinded him to threats to House Blackadder\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dTytos was the third-born son of the Duke of Eastshire. His elder brothers died fighting against vikings who raided a village by the coast. Tytos became Duke after the death of his father\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dVassals and merchants took advantage of the weak-willed Tytos, who was eager to please. He loaned money to nobles who never bothered to repay him, and his vassals openly ignored his orders. Guests at his court were allowed to mock him to his face, called \"twisting the snake's tail\". The power of House Blackadder waned and many other neighboring Houses grew in strength. Many said that \u201dthe Black Adder\u201d was no longer a beast to fear and japed about toothless snakes\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dHouse Redlion of Castamere were an ancient and noble house from the time of King Arthur and his knights. Their castle was built atop a goldmine. Its power and wealth grew under Tytos's poor leadership. Normally jovial, Tytos became sorrowful after his wife died within a moon of giving birth to their son, Roose. Much later, Tytos had begun taking a mistress every few years\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dRoose was forced to watch his mighty house nearly brought to ruin through his father\u2019s actions. He grew to be a terrifying fighter by the age of sixteen and by then was one of four thousand men from Eastshire took part of the Bretonnian crusade against the orcs who came down from the Grey Mountains, the mountain range that separates Bretonnia and the Empire. He was knighted by a Bretonnian knight\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dBattle hardened from the crusade, Roose was determined to restore the power of House Blackadder. Duke Tytos protested feebly before returning to the comfort and embrace of his mistress. Roose began by demanding the repayment of the gold his father lent out; those who could not repay immediately had to send a hostage to Durnovaria until their debt was settled. He charged one of his closest friend with command of five hundred veteran knights from the crusade to rid Eastshire of robber knights and bandit outlaws\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dSome hastened to obey, and a landed knight is said to have stated, \"The Blackadder has awoken\u201d. Unable to pay his loan at the time, the knight agreed to surrender his daughter into Roose's custody, and elsewhere collectors were met with sullen resistance and open defiance. Earl Redlion reportedly laughed when he read Roose's edicts and counseled his friends and vassals to do nothing\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dThe daughter would later become Roose\u2019s first wife. When Roose rode with his armed escort and arrived at Castamere, he warned \u201dthe Red Lion of Castamere\u201d that if he doesn't pay back what he owned, House Blackadder will bring \u201dFire and Steel\u201d upon him. The earl thought it was just a empty warning from a \u201dfoolish boy\u201d, and laughed\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dBut that was his mistake. A month later, the earl got up early one morning and decided to walk on his walls\u2026 Only to see a whole army of six thousand beneath the walls. By the end of the day, the castle was aflame, and the earl and his entire family was put to the sword. The castle is now a ruin and the mine beneath it is now at the hands of the Blackadders\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dThe shattered castle is a mute testimony to the fate that awaits those who scorn the power of Durnovaria. Such was the brutality of Duke Roose's destruction of House Redlion that a song called \"The Rains of Castamere\" was written as a tribute to the event. Indeed when Earl Daubeny of Border\u2019s Watch later grew truculent the duke sent a messenger with a lute instead of a letter and once \"The Rains of Castamere\" was played the count caused no further trouble\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dHe began training the best soldiers in the realm and by the time he turned 18, he commanded both respect and fear. And then he was chosen as Marshal\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dHis father, Tytos, had been fat for many years, and finally keeled over a burst heart while climbing a flight of steps to visit his new mistress, and Roose of House Blackadder became the new Duke of Eastshire. He banished that woman from the duchy after that\u201d<br>\r\nI felt a chill in me while hearing all this, before I asked \u201dand Stag\u2019s Mount?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWhen the fighting was done, the enemy camp was sacked. We heard that the chieftain had a wife and children in his tent, and we thought that we would make it to the tent and bring them to Camelot, so the king would send them away back to Norsca. But Gregor and Andar made was there first\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dGregor and Andar?\u201d\u2028<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dTwo brothers whose mother was raped by a giant in the Empire and were born here in Albion. A knight in the service of House Blackadder adopted them and trained them in brutal combat, and inspired them to use their half-giant strength to their advantage. Duke Roose had them taken to their service and knighted them before marching north\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThey murdered the chieftain\u2019s family, and while Alester and I called murder, Roose called it war\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhen we said that it was only children, he pointed out that \u201dthey were spawns of a savage\u201d.

It was ripped to shreds. \u201dmountain lion?\u201d wondered Poddy, and sir Terrance pointed out the obvious \u201dthere are no mountain lions in Albion, Poddy\u201d \u201dYeah, everyone knows that!\u201d said Ronnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith weapons out, we followed the hound who\u2019s following a scent into the woods. We didn't get far when we found the thing that killed the stag. Or what\u2019s left of it. It looks like a corpse of a wolf\u2026 but what amaze me is the size of it! It\u2019s as large as a pony! And there are pups whimpering around it (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/1/11/Direwolf_pups.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/1/11/D...</a>). Sir Mors kneels beside it to inspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dIt\u2019s a freak\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIt\u2019s a direwolf, Ronnet. I remember seeing a sketch of it in a book once a few years ago\u201d.<br>\r\nMors and Alester glance at each other. \u201dTough old beast\u201d said Mors before he pulls something of it, \u201da crossbow bolt\u201d.<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dThere are no direwolfs outside the mountains\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dNow there are six\u201d, seeing the pups around the mother. \u201dSeven\u201d I corrected, as I pick up from the bushes another pup, an albino with red eyes. I find it curious that it is the only pup that has opened its eyes. \u201dMust have crawled away from its mother\u201d I said, while Alester replied \u201dor been driven away\u201d. And then I see one of the pups have also opened its eyes. And amazingly, those eyes are blue. I had Bryan to hold the white pup while I picked up the blue-eyed one. John picked one with fascination. I decided to check the genders of the pups. There are five male (including the white) and two female.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dThe crossbow bolt killed it?\u201d, he asked sir Mors.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dOne of Cregan\u2019s men uses a crossbow\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dI\u2019m surprised she lived long enough to whelp\u201d<br>\r\nBryan Connor; \u201dWhere will they go? Their mother\u2019s dead\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dThey don't belong down here. Better a quick death. They won\u2019t last without their mother\u201d<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dRight. And the white one will die even faster. Sir John, give it here\u201d, he draw a dagger from his belt, but as he was about to grab the pup John was holding, John suddenly drew his own dagger and held it close to Ronnet\u2019s throat.<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dPut away your blade\u201d, he said it with disgust.<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dTerrance\u2019s right, they won't last. And I have a bad feeling about this\u201d<br>\r\nWalder \u201dI agree. Pups born of a dead mother, that\u2019s a bad omen\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs seven a bad omen?\u201d, everyone looks at me, \u201dthe number seven is holy in the Faith\u201d, I then point at the pups, \u201dThere are seven pups. They're without a mother. And I'm going to take care of them, as John will take care of the one he\u2019s holding, right John?\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dYour Majesty, think about i-\u2026 sir Mors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood by a pile of leafs next to a tree. He took one to inspect, and I notice it\u2019s glittering. Alester joined him and moves the leafs, to find seven small, glittering bottles. That\u2019s when I understood.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe Fae\u2026 they must have found the mother dying and helped her giving birth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201d\u2026before she died. And they left us these. These are all filled with never ending magi-milk. To feed the pups\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dThe Fae knew we would find them. But let me warn you, Your Majesty: no royal, lord, knight or peasant in history have raised, or tamed, a direwolf\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThen me and John will the first ones. And maybe for each pup, except mine and John\u2019s, I find someone to care for them\u201d, I then announce to everyone \u201dwe will train them ourselves. We will feed them ourselves. And if they die, we will bury them ourselves. And if you're all wondering: this one is mine\u201d, I held it up for all to see.<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dAnd this one\u2019s mine\u201d, holding up his own pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalder quickly prepared a basket for the seven pups, and we continued on hunting sir Cregan and his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI named my pup Balto\u2026</span></div></div>",

The castle name was meant to mean \u201da new mark on history of the family\u201d.<br>\r\nFor four and a half centuries the family had held the keep as earls and served the crown loyally, until the reign of Alaric I Pendragon, also known as \u201dthe Mad\u201d.<br>\r\nEven as a child he had a taste for cruelty. But his madness and paranoia started when he was abducted by outlaws, was being beaten and tormented before he was rescued. He was extremely jealous of his brother, Orys. After Orys I had reigned for a short time, Alaric murdered him in his sleep (although it wasn't revealed until years later). He saw enemies everywhere, saw unexplained event or act of defiance as evidence of fearful conspiracies against him, and devised sadistic punishments for those he imagined to be his enemies. Alaric didn't trust the daughters of his vassals, so when he encountered a group of pixie sisters, who smuggled themselves into his realm, he lusted for them and married the eldest of the pixies and took the rest as bedwarmers for the rest of his life.<br>\r\nWhen the mad king raped his young daughter, Earl Leon Wood of Wood\u2019s Mark rise up in rebellion against him. But he was alone and when the king attacked the castle, he slaughtered the earl and his whole family and burned down the castle (similar to what Duke Blackadder did to Castamere centuries later).<br>\r\nThe castle has been empty ever since as no one wants it, since many noblemen believe it to be cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hound came back to us before we got too close, so we sat off our horses and have Walder, Patrek and my squire to guard the horses and watch over the pups while the rest of us head for Wood\u2019s Mark.<br>\r\nWe hid behind trees not far from the abandoned keep. It looks a bit whole but would still need repairs.<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dRuins. But still a good hiding place\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dAre we gonna be forced to fight Cregan\u2019s men\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dCregan is well respected by his men, and they wouldn't like him being accused for rape. But there're only four following him, so we outnumber them\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIf he hears what he\u2019s accused for, he\u2019ll be desperate and try to fight his way out\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dCregan is easily worth ten of you, sir Terrance\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dWe still need to come up with a plan\u201d, his brother Adrian agree.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSomething doesn't feel right\u201d, everyone looks at me, \u201dthere are lights in there\u201d, and that\u2019s when they finally notice. Cregan\u2019s group is small and shouldn't have lights everywhere. I gave an order to Gorold and Ronnet, \u201dscout the woods near the keep, and quietly\u201d, they nodded and went off. Mors told his hound to accompany them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes by, and they haven't come back yet. Suddenly we hear a grown man sing from a distant. We readied our weapons for whatever is heading towards us\u2026 and to our surprise it\u2019s Patrek, accompanied by an elf and a dwarf!<br>\r\nThe silver-blonde elf appears to be a wood elf (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/68cf/th/pre/i/2014/067/b/a/legolas_by_jow3ew0l-d73nm4e.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://pre00.deviantart.net/68cf/th/pre...</a>) with green clothes and leather armour. He is armed with a longbow and arrows and what appears to be two long white knifes.<br>\r\nThe dwarf (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Dwarf_by_BrokenMachine86.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a>) is 4 feet tall and wear a chainmail, iron helm and leather boots, and he has a big brown beard. His weapons are a two handed axe and a small axe on the hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're both from my dreams!<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat the hell is this?\u201d, I'm a bit shocked at the moment.<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dThese two came across our camp\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dNever heard of an wood elf and a dwarf walking together\u201d. Alester on the other hand walked up to them and shake their hands.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dPleasant seeing you two again\u201d<br>\r\nWood elf; \u201dPleasant seeing you as well, sir Alester\u201d<br>\r\nDwarf; \u201dI thought you were still in Marienburg and devoted to that ridiculous cult of yours\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dI am still devoted to it. But my father has passed and now I am Earl of Riverspring\u201d<br>\r\nWood elf; \u201d(You have my condolences)\u201d, he spoke in elvish.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dExcuse me!\u201d, the three looks at my direction, \u201dcare to explain, Earl Alester?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dMy apologies Your Majesty. I was in a adventure with these two a few years back. An adventure that made us friends\u201d<br>\r\nWood elf; \u201dI am Legolas, son of Lord Thranduil of Mirkwood. My name means Greenleaf\u201d<br>\r\nDwarf; \u201dAnd I'm Gimli, son of Gl\u00f3in. And I don't like to be called short\u201d, he chuckled.<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dI met your grandfather many years ago. He was a great man\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI have never heard of a friendship between an wood elf and a dwarf\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWe have no time for chattering! Cregan and his will know we\u2019re here thanks to these two\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas then turned his head to the deep part of the woods, \u201dI hear two men and a hound coming this way. I heard sounds of a fight on the way here\u201d. We readied ourselves again\u2026 And it\u2019s Ronnet with Gorold having his left arm over Ronnet\u2019s shoulders, limbing and his right arm over his belly.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWhat the hell happened?!\u201d<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dThis happened\u201d, he took something that hanged from his belt and threw it to the ground. It\u2019s a small head of a humanoid dragon with horns and scales. A Dragon-kin!<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dDon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s what I think it is\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dI\u2019m afraid it is brother\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMors and Alester sat Gorold down next to a tree, and he\u2019s bleeding heavily\u2026<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dThat thing caught us off guard. Seems like dogs can't smell a Dragon or a kin. It breath a little fire, knocked away Ronnet and gave me plenty of cuts, but the dog bit its leg, distracting and I chopped off its head from the body\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dYou have lost too much blood, and we\u2019re far from help with the wounds. They are too deep. I'm sorry\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dDon\u2019t be. I always wanted to die fighting a Dragon-kin\u201d, his breathing was getting fewer and his voice getting low, \u201dwe had\u2026 some fun\u2026 right, Mors?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dGoodbye, old brother\u201d<br>\r\nGorold; \u201dGoodbye\u2026 old friend\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 see you\u2026 on the other\u2026 side\u2026\u201d, and the breathing stopped.<br>\r\nMors moved his hand over Gorold\u2019s face to close his eyes. \u201dMay you find peace in the afterlife\u201d I prayed. Mors then looked at the head of the Dragon-kin, \u201da Dragon-kin, this is not a good sign\u2026 They never move alone\u2026\u201d, we all knew what that means, \u201dWe've never seen these beasts so close inland, close to Camelot. And Cregan\u2019s group should be here already\u2026 We need to find out more!\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dBut there are only nine of us, could there be more of them?\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dNine brave warriors of Albion\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dAnd we are eleven\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dYou're not taking all the fun (chuckle)\u201d<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dYou wanted action, right?! Well, this is it, so stop whining\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dIt\u2019s madness, Sir Mors. We don't know how many there are!\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWell, now there\u2019s one less. And we are\u2026\u201d \u201deleven\u201d, I interrupted, \u201dI will NOT tolerate any plunderers in my kingdom. So me and my bodyguards, John and Adrian, are going too, whether any of you like it or not\u201d</span></div></div>",

We all check equipment and weapons first of all:<br>\r\nI have my Excalibur and a wooden shield. My outfit is a suit of chainmail and an open face barbute helmet.<br>\r\nSir John Connor and Sir Terrance have their longswords and shields. John wears chainmail while Terrance wears a breastplate over his own chainmail.<br>\r\nSir Mors Westford have not only longsword and shield, but also a greatsword (just in case). His outfit is of chainmail with the tabard of House Westford.<br>\r\nEarl Alester Sarwyck uses a longsword made of High-Elven steel (Alester said it was a gift and it\u2019s named Telp\u00ebn\u00e1r - \u201dthe Silver Fire\u201d). Could the dream refer to that (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/14614243851_76d6071fa9_c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/1461...</a>)? He has the tabard of House Sarwyck over his suit of chainmail.<br>\r\nSir Adrian Connor had his sword on his left hip and his shield on his back. Then he took Gorold\u2019s sword and attached it on his right hip. When I asked why, he said \u201dtwo swords are better than one\u201d, I raised an eyebrow and he just shrugged and said \u201dyou'll see\u201d. Wears chainmail.<br>\r\nPatrek have his war-hammer and Poddy have his longbow. Patrek wears chainmail while Poddy has leather.<br>\r\nLegolas, the elf, have his own longbow along with the two knifes and Gimli, the dwarf, have his axes. I overheard them talking about their usual \u201dlittle contest\u201d, about which one could kill the most. I later asked Legolas about his hearing, and he replied that he can see and hear at great distances. Useful to our advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sneaked quietly around the castle and found the hole beneath a tower, only to find the door that would lead us out of the tower is blocked by rocks. So we had to walk the stairs up so we can go along the wall to the next tower\u2026 and when we got on top the stairs we came across two Dragon-kin, who Legolas quickly dispatched with his arrows.<br>\r\nWe got inside the next tower where we would then walk down the stairs into the burned Godswood\u2026 but we quickly find a man with a lot of bodies of Dragon-kin around him, including one pierced with what I presume is his sword. He looks heavily wounded and is groaning.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dCregan! What happened here?\u201d<br>\r\nCregan; \u201dThe Butcher\u2019s here? You\u2019re too late\u2026 There are Dragon-kin everywhere. I killed a few, but there were too many. Two of them\u2026 Mors\u2026 they're beasts, I tell you\u2026 I did what I could do to save my lads by luring some of the bastards to me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWhere did your men go?\u201d<br>\r\nCregan; \u201dI sent them to try their luck getting on the walkway and scale down the wall. Get out of here if you want to live\u2026 Mors, go\u2026\u201d, and he died.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dYou piece of trash! A raper like you doesn't deserve to die this well!\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dThe scavengers will take care of him!\u201d<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dAnd those of all the Dragon-kin he killed\u2026 not bad at all\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWhen your time comes, do as he did and take as many with you as you can\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dWe\u2019ll try to remember that, sir\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dWe must leave, Sir Mors, we don't have a chance\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dRemember what happened to Gorold, Poddy!\u201d<br>\r\nRonnet; \u201dIf I must die, at least I\u2019ll plant my dagger in my killer\u2019s eye!\u201d, Gimli agreed to that.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dI hope that it will be so, Ronnet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe moved down the stairs as quietly as we could. And we entered the Godswood. No trees, no grass, no bushes\u2026 but several Dragon-kin watching three men burned to stake. Cregan\u2019s men! We attacked, and while the others have their own fights, I stood face-to-face with a skinny Dragon-kin armed with axe and shield. I used my shield to block his attacks while I gave him cuts on arm, leg and wing, until I saw my chance and pierced the sword through his chest and out of his back. My first kill. If only Sir Robert and Godfrey of Ibelin could see me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got them all we noticed a pile of rags close by. I removed them\u2026 to see a naked, female Dragon-kin. This one is fully covered in purple scales, except her face, chest, belly and crotch where the scales are pink and she has dark blue eyes. Her breasts are very large and her nipples are purple also. Her hips are wide and her waist is thin. What\u2019s really interesting is that she has no horns, no pointed spines on her spine, and surprisingly no wings!<br>\r\nShe also have a shackle with a loose chain on her ankle, indicating she's a prisoner.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWho are you?\u201d, I knelt down, lend her a hand and help her up.<br>\r\nDragoness; \u201dI am Akita. The daughter of chief Ferron of the tribe of the Moon Light, killed along with mother, brothers and sisters\u201d<br>\r\nJust as I was about to ask who killed them, Legolas heard something. Two men, one sounding like an old man, approaching.<br>\r\nAnd to our surprise we see a warrior enter the Godswood\u2026 A Templar Knight of the Faith! They are believed to be among the best knights in Middle Earth after the Grail Knights of Bretonnia. He is accompanied by an old monk. This templar is wearing chainmail with the tabard of the red cross (the symbol of his order) (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/99/f4/09/99f409bdf6962c800a2306b7272c2959--actor-james-james-darcy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/99/f4/09/99f40...</a>). He carries one longsword on his hip and a greatsword (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fableblades.com/Photos/LiveTrue/VivereVerus14.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fableblades.com/Photos/LiveTr...</a>) on his back (could he be the templar from my dreams?).<br>\r\nHe and the monk approached us, while the templar readied his longsword in case more Dragon-kin appears.<br>\r\nThe monk; \u201dGreetings dear sirs, I'm Abbot Marcus and this is Sir Thomas Marshall. Please forgive him, he took a vow of silence when he joined the order 30 years ago\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019m King Arthur\u2026\u201d and I introduced the rest of us.<br>\r\nAbbot Marcus; \u201dWhat happened here?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWe were hunting down Cregan, who raped and beaten a poor boy, and his men\u2026 they're all dead now, killed by the Dragon-kin\u2026 One of them had killed one of us earlier\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBut what are you doing here, if I may ask?\u201d<br>\r\nAbbot Marcus; \u201dWe were heading for Camelot, and I was interested if this place is really cursed. Who is she?\u201d, indicating the dragoness.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dI\u2019m Akita and I'm a prisoner here. And there\u2019s 300 more of these bastards\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201d300?!\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dLed by the one who slaughtered my clan. Gorn\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dGorn?!\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dDragon-kin approaching\u201d, his eyes on the door at the end of the yard.<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dAh! More fun for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe readied our weapons and formed a line, with Akita and the abbot behind us safely. The door bursts open and six Dragon-kin poured out. Two of them were the \u201dbeasts\u201d Cregan was talking about: nearly eight feet tall and bulging with muscles. One with grey scales held a big two-handed axe and the one with brown scales have several one-handed axes on his belt, and hands. The brown one suddenly threw an axe and it hit right on Ronnet\u2019s face, killing him.<br>\r\nThe four smaller ones were started to move towards us\u2026 but when they were halfway, I see Adrian drop his shield and draw Gorold\u2019s sword with the shield hand, and approach them. The Dragon-kin just laugh, probably think he's an idiot (I don't doubt Mors think the same). To be honest I fear for my friend, since he's never seen practice with one sword on each hand. They attack him, but he surprisingly blocks every attack, even two or three at the same time! As he backed to the wall he then charged forward, killing one by slicing the Dragon-kin\u2019s front with both sword. Then he sliced second one\u2019s throat and when he blocks the third one\u2019s attack above with left sword (Gorold\u2019s), he pierced the right sword in the heart, leaving number 4 alone. How does he do that?!<br>\r\nJust like us (except Legolas), the beasts were shocked seeing a human knight dual wielding like it was a dance. It IS unusual to see a knight wielding two sword. The 4th Dragon-kin decided to dual wield as well and took another sword from one of the dead ones. And he then fights Adrian.<br>\r\nThe beasts started to recover as Sir Thomas approached the grey with his greatsword and Sir Mors approach the brown with shield and longsword.<br>\r\nThree different fights that didn't last very long. The templar pierced his greatsword through the grey\u2019s head. Mors knocked out the brown with his shield. Lastly, Adrian cut one hand at the time, and when that Dragon-kin was in a state of shock, Adrian pierced both swords through him. And it was done.<br>\r\nJohn and I walked to his brother.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhere did you learn to fight like that?!\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dYeah! Never seen you use swords on both hands before!\u201d, he seems proud of his younger brother.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dRemember that Tilean swordsman that lived in the capital for a time? He saw that I was comfortable with a sword in both hands and he taught me to use two. I practiced privately and waited for a chance for dual wielding, and it happened today. I got lucky enough to survive without a scratch!\u201d, he chuckled.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell, I'm glad to have you as a bodyguard!\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dAnd I'm proud of being your brother!\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dBut it\u2019s not over yet I'm afraid\u201d, I jolted of her sudden appearance. I nearly forgot.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhere\u2019s the rest?\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dSearching for food and Fae girls in the woods. But they\u2019ll be back as soon as the hunting horn sounds\u201d, Mors and Alester heard it. We suddenly heard Poddy scream.</span></div></div>",

That one\u2019s still moving!\u201d, everyone surrounds the brown Dragon-kin who\u2019s still lays on the ground, groaning and without weapons (Sir Terrance and Poddy had removed them), \u201dThat bastard got Ronnet. I\u2019ll finish him off!\u201d, Fortunately Mors intervened.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dDon\u2019t touch him, Poddy! He\u2019s not going to die right away. I\u2019ve got questions for him\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dThat one is called Gendel. One of Gorn\u2019s headmen\u201d, Gendel recovered mostly after she said it. He has cuts all over the body, so he won\u2019t be any trouble.<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dYou're as dangerous as ever, \u201dButcher\u201d. At least I buried one of your boys\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBoy? He was a man grown. Me and my two friends here are the only boys here, and we killed those bigger than us!\u201d, John and Adrian laughed along with me while Gendel just muttered.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dBeasts like you always travel in packs. Your leader must be nearby. Where is he?! Where is Gorn?!\u201d<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dShit on you, human!\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dYou have a choice, either spit it out and I finish you off cleanly or else I\u2019ll take my time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dGo bugger yourself, old man!\u201d, Mors then draws a knife from his belt and plunged it into Gendel\u2019s knee, \u201dArgh! Son of a whore! Argh! Enough! I\u2019ll tell you what you want to know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dFine\u2026 What are doing so deep inland and so close to Camelot?\u201d<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dThere were only the two of us and our warriors. We just sneaked into the woods\u2026\u201d, he then saw Akita and shut up.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dYou lie! You never could have entered the kingdom unnoticed!\u201d<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dGorn left a long time ago! I swear to it!\u201d, Mors then twisted the knife an inch, \u201dBastard humans! You're all out of your heads!\u201d, I don't know if I should approve this torture. Akita then spoke up; \u201dall I know is that they're looking for something here\u201d, Mors nodded in agreement.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dSpeak and I will put an end to your suffering. You'll give in either way\u2026 Everyone talks eventually\u201d<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dIt\u2019s true. Gorn planned it all. We came from the sea in the west\u2026 We attacked a few villages, until our scout saw the demons of the Wolf Warriors heading our way! But instead of going back the way we came, Gorn made us travel east to the forrest\u2026 We covered our tracks and then we moved south. Gorn led us here because he believes that something is hidden here, beneath the courtyard\u2026 Weapons powerful enough to carve through armies\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dYou're still lying!\u201d, he pulls the dagger out and puts back in his belt, before he draws his longsword ready to kill. And for a terrifying beast, the brown Dragon-kin looks scared as hell.<br>\r\nGendel; \u201dI beg you\u2026 stop\u2026 Please, no!\u201d, and Mors pierced the head through the eye. Killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dMay the Goddess of Mercy take you into her arms\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dOur gods are not his\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dMay the demons of Hell give him what he deserves!\u201d, Mors gave him a stern look.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThat pillager could easily have killed you and there are more of them in the ruins. Spare your curses and stay focused on staying alive, lad!\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dI understand\u2026 Those beasts are truly ferocious\u201d<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dWhat now, Mors?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThere\u2019s a whole clan of Dragon-kin not far from here\u2026 and they'll know we've spotted them. He mentioned the Wolf Warriors\u2026 They are relentless, and not easy to lose. If they're close by and tracking these Dragon-kin, they'll get them. If what we heard about Gorn is true, he's surveying the area and preparing an ambush to slow down the Wolf Warriors of the North. We\u2019ll go to the courtyard and find out what they're doing. And if they alarm Gorn, he\u2019ll take every fighter he has and attack us in strength. They'll be stuck be here and hopefully the Wolfs can just finish them off\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dPerfect! the dogs will be trapped\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dAnd us with them\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dYeah!\u201d, he\u2019s scared of the idea.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIt\u2019s a risk we have to take\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe\u2019s right. We can\u2019t let this opportunity go. Gorn is one of the most dangerous dragon-kin chieftains from Aeryn\u2026 We\u2019ve got to give it a try\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dAnd there are many to avenge\u201d<br>\r\nI turned to the abbot, \u201dI advise that you and Akita get out of here through the opened wall and to our camp in the west, for safety\u201d<br>\r\nAbbot Marcus; \u201dIf Your Majesty wish\u201d, he bowed and left.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dI believe I can handle myself, but thank you for your kindness\u201d, she kissed me on the cheek and followed Abbot Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of us went through the door were the two beasts came from. As we were heading for the courtyard, we stopped on our tracks to hear a loud horn.<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dHoly hell! What was that noise?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dA Dragon-kin hunting horn. They're retreating to the courtyard and alarming Gorn now that they know we\u2019re close\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dProbably because of all the noise we made\u201d, not meant to be a joke.<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dBy the gods\u2026 we\u2019re all going to die right here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dWhat do you mean <b>we</b>?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dShut up Poddy. We\u2019ll be doing the attacking\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dBut we have no hope, sir\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dDon\u2019t worry, Poddy, I saw worse in the battle of Stag\u2019s Mount\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dConcentrate on the present, Poddy. From what I heard from Sir Mors here, you're not bad with a bow. Cover us from the balcony with Legolas. Follow me\u201d, I have seen the architectural sketches of the castle so I know a bit of where we\u2019re going.<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dAt your command!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went to the chamber were the balcony looking over the courtyard was. Three Dragon-kin was already there, and they were surprised by Mors\u2019 hound biting the leader\u2019s leg, distracting them while Legolas killed each of them with a arrow.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dPoddy, you and Legolas stand here\u201d, indicating the balcony.<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dAs you wish, Your Majesty\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dYou can count on me, Your Majesty!\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dCover us as long as you can, understood?\u201d<br>\r\nPoddy; \u201dI\u2019ll do my best!\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dYou'd best do better than that, boy. It\u2019s our arses you and Legolas are covering!\u201d, he chuckled.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dWe\u2019ll go down and fight them in the courtyard, so don't fall asleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going down all the steps and through passages, we got to the courtyard. We see at least two dozen Dragon-kin here. But that didn't stop us from fighting.<br>\r\nAs we fought them off one-by-one, a few were killed by the arrows by Legolas and Poddy. When the fight is over, Mors looked at the dead ones with Poddy\u2019s arrows, \u201dPoddy is a craven wretch, but at least he can aim!\u201d.<br>\r\nWe all looked at the center of the courtyard, and see a pit being dug in the ground. And in the bottom of the pit we see something that looks like a massive, thick trapdoor made of stone, with elvish words written on it. Non of us certainly didn't expect that.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dBlack blood! There <i>is</i> something hidden here, and those pillagers have dug faster than I realized\u2026 Almost like they're going to open it\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019ve read something about this in the library. We need Legolas to translate this\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dAye! He\u2019s the only one of us who can speak it\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhat about Gorn?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dHe\u2019s right. We still haven't seen him or his mongrels\u2026 Be on your guard, everyone\u201d<br>\r\nSir Terrance; \u201dSir Mors! Legolas is trying to tell us something!\u201d, we looked up at the balcony and see Legolas point in the direction to the forest.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dThey're coming. Get in defensive formation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later we hear something above us\u2026 and see a black Dragon-kin flying above us (Dragon-kin have wings, remember?), and then suddenly lands in front of us. Most of the Dragon-kin pour out of the broken main gate, while many archers climbed over the battlements and aimed their bows at us.<br>\r\nThe black Dragon-kin then stood up and we could his whole appearance: he\u2019s over eight feet tall with more muscles than Gendel and the other beast, his eyes have the color of golden moonlight, wings large and wide and he has scales black as the darkest night and painted on with white markings including a white hand across the face. He has no armour at all, but he carries a massive two-handed battle-axe in his hands.<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a few of his mongrels are dragging two people and stops behind their leader\u2026 Akita and Abbot Marcus!<br>\r\nGorn; \u201dMors! The gods have given me a feast of crows today!\u201d, his voice was dark and loud.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dGorn! You finally show your face!\u201d<br>\r\nGorn; \u201dAnd it\u2019s between you and me! Kill the boy!\u201d, Who the hell did he mean?! But it didn't seem to matter for two of the archers on the battlements, as they fired on Terrance. Poddy yelled \u201dSir Terrance!\u201d, and he too was killed by an arrow through his throat! When the abbot tries to plead, the Dragon-kin holding him took his tongue and cut it off!<br>\r\nMe; \u201dDamn you all!\u201d, they pushed Akita towards us and she stood among us. All of us are angry, Sir Thomas most of us as he sees Abbot Marcus, laying on the ground shaking with his mouth bleeding.<br>\r\nGorn; \u201dThe Butcher is mine! Don't interfere! After you die, I\u2019ll be a legend! Females will fight for my seed\u2026 I'm going to bleed you, old man!\u201d, he points the axe towards Mors, who just chuckles.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dIf you knew how many times I've heard that\u2026 You're already dead to me, Gorn\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fight between Mors and Gorn lasted for nearly an hour. During that time, Sir Thomas Marshall picked up Abbot Marcus and when they got back to the group, he held on to the Abbot who died soon after. The templar then laid him down and readied his sword with us in the formation. Legolas remained on the balcony, ready with both his arrows and Poddy\u2019s.<br>\r\nAnd the fight ended with Mors slicing up Gorn\u2019s belly, forcing the Dragon-kin to hold it, fall to his knees and bend forward a bit. Then Mors chop off Gorn\u2019s head clean off.<br>\r\nNow we are all forced to fight (I give Akita a dagger in case she has too). They came at us a few at the time. When Legolas ran out of arrows after firing at both warriors and archers, he's forced to fight alongside us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are too many of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know if we fought for minutes or hours. All I know is that all of us (except Legolas and Gimli) have wounds from either or both cuts and arrows. <br>\r\nI fought like I never had before. With Excalibur in hand, I easily slice a Dragon-kin in half and cut a weapon in pieces. Even though I had some cuts on my left arm (forcing me to drop my shield) and right leg and even got slashed by two of a Dragon-kin\u2019s claws over my left side of the face (after I lost my helmet to another one of those bastards) forcing me to have the eye closed, I still fought with fury\u2026 but then I started to get hit by one arrow at a time: one at my left shoulder, one at my right knee, one at my hip and finally one at my right chest. Most of the others also get an arrow or two, but they keep on fighting.<br>\r\nThen the Dragon-kin stopped and backed away, the ones on the battlements stopped firing their arrows. They're getting ready to finish us off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly fell down from exhaustion but both Sir Adrian and Sir Thomas held on to me. And as everyone else start to surround me, I realize they rather die than letting them take me. The Dragon-kin starts to move closer and closer, I then decided to die, not as a king, but as a warrior. \u201dUnited\u2026 We\u2026 Stand\u201d, everyone listens as I speak the words, \u201dUnited we stand. United we stand. UNITED. WE. STAND!\u201d, the others join in the battle cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stand together. Or die trying\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the Dragon-kin starts marching faster towards us, we readied ourselves and roared as he charge at us with his battle-axe\u2026 Only to fall and land in front of us. With three arrows on his back.<br>\r\nI hear one of the bastards starting to say \u201dWhat the fuck are y-\u201d only to stop when he looks at the battlements. The other Dragon-kin looks that way too, and so did we\u2026 And what a surprise we got! Instead of Dragon-kin archers, we see human archers, with red-brown leather armour and helms and strong-looking longbows. They all have their arrows ready to fire.<br>\r\nAs I smiled despite my injuries, I heard one of the dragon-kin say \u201dOh. Fuck\u201d. And that\u2019s when I heard \u201dFIRE!\u201d, and arrows came down raining on the Dragon-kin killing many of them. And suddenly we all hear the sound of horses from the other side. And from the gate came mounted men armed to the teeth, shouting \u201dFOR THE NORTH!\u201d and \u201dIRON FROM ICE!\u201d, and they started to ride down every bastard they could find in the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I started to feel dizzy. And everything turned black\u2026</span></div></div>",

Although it\u2019s a bit different this time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snowy battlefield, me in armour and on Bretonnian Warhorse, against the black and white snakes with the warriors. Couldn\u2019t see the faces of the tall knight, the woman knight, the viper with the spear, the red and white knight, the archer, the griffon warrior, the viking and the samurai. But I do see the faces of the others\u2026 Sir Mors Westford (the black dog), Earl Alester Sarwyck (the sword of fire), Legolas (the Elf), Gimli (the dwarf) and Sir Thomas Marshall (the templar). And I also see several direwolfs attacking the snakes\u2026 one has black and white fur, and blue eyes. Marshall was fighting close to me, along with six other knights. All in white armour, even Marshall though he has the red cross on the chest. The woman knight was one of the six.<br>\r\nSeven warriors all fighting to defend me. I now find myself in armour and with weapon and shield, with the massive black snake behind me. I turned. Go in defensive formation. And it attacks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And my right eye opened suddenly, and see Akita riding slowly on my shaft. I normally don\u2019t allow anyone to do that while I\u2019m still sleeping. But she seems to be glowing with a violet aura surrounding her whole body.<br>\r\nFor some reason I feel fine beside that my body feels tired and presumably wearing bandage over my left eye. I seem to be laying on a pile of furs on a single bed in a lightly lit room.<br>\r\nAnd then my shaft released into her womb, and I feel even more relaxed. I hear giggles from a corner of the room. I move my head and I see two forms of females there. I then look back at Akita.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dMay I ask what you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dI\u2019m not raping you if that\u2019s what you think. Some of us Dragon-kin are born with magical powers. One of mine is healing through mating\u201d, she gets off me, sliding my shaft out of her folds and puts it back in my trousers and draws a cover over my body, as if not wanting me to freeze and I\u2019m too weak to move.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dReally? And what day is it?\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dStill the early morning after the battle with Gorn\u2019s tribe. Never thought they be defeated\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIndeed, but at what price? Most of Sir Mors\u2019 men are dead, as well as those of Cregan\u2019s group. But, in spite of our loses, it is a good day for Albion. Gorn and his curs would have slaughtered too many of the people if not for the Wolf Warriors. I believe that we owe our lives to them\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dAnd the Forresters\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI thought I heard \u201dIron form Ice\u201d before I blacked out!\u201d, I heard giggle again and decided to know, \u201dand who are they?\u201d indicating my head to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkita beckoned her clawed finger and they moved to the bed. They turn out to be very voluptuous vixens. One red and one white. The red vixen have a long and flowing auburn hair and the white vixen have a short and pitch black hair. Both are naked like Akita.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dThe red is named Sheila and the white is her sister Artica, named after her mother\u2019s home in the cold north of Narnia. Both have different mothers but same father\u201d<br>\r\nSheila; \u201dWe CAN speak his tongue you know\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dI know, just like to embarrass you two\u201d, all three laugh. It\u2019s like sweet melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vixens then told their tale: their mothers are childhood friends and priestesses who often shared the same males in Narnia. One being their mutual father, a human adventurer from Morien. The sisters were born at the same day in a eastern coast city were their mothers lived in.<br>\r\nThe Vixens developed their own magical powers; Sheila have the power to enhance pleasure during mating, while Artica have the power of ice manifestation and manipulation.<br>\r\nWhen the Vixens turned nineteen earlier this year, they decided to explore the world beyond the the Great Ocean. The mothers gave them their blessings and wished them good fortune before their daughters went aboard the ship that sails to the seas.<br>\r\nTheir fortune didn\u2019t last long however. A storm forced their ship\u2019s course too close to Aeryn, where it\u2019s boarded by warriors from Gorn\u2019s tribe. The Vixens were the only survivors (Artica\u2019s powers wasn\u2019t much against dragon-fire).<br>\r\nThey were given to Gorn, but he was busy planing the raid on Wood\u2019s Mark for unknown reasons. But nobody dared to touch Gorn\u2019s \u201dproperty\u201d.<br>\r\nIn the months that followed the sisters befriended Akita, who too was a prisoner. While Gorn did the raid, the Vixens were locked up in cell below the castle\u2026 until they were freed by Akita and my knights (Mors and Alester).<br>\r\nAkita convinced everyone in my group to free her of the shackle on her ankle and let her heal me through the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here we all are.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI thank you, Akita. You saved me from near death\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dIt is we who should thank you. If you and your men had not come, we would suffer Gorn\u2019s overbearing lust\u201d, the Vixens nodded in agreement eagerly.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNow there\u2019s the question of what I will do with you three. Akita, your tribe\u2019s gone so it will be hard to find you a new home. And if you sisters wish it, I would give you a ship so you would go home to Narnia\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dActually, Your Majesty, I wish to be your personal healer\u201d<br>\r\nArtica; \u201dAnd we wish to be your servants in your home\u201d<br>\r\nSheila; \u201dAnd in bed\u201d, she gave me a lustful gaze\u2026 but before I could think or say anything there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n\u201dCome in\u201d I said, nearly forgetting about the three beauties around the bed. The door opens to show Bryan, my faithful squire, entering. And as soon as he notices the females being naked, his face turned red and he looked down on the floor.<br>\r\nArtica; \u201dAww, don\u2019t be shy!\u201d<br>\r\nSheila; \u201dYeah! Nothing wrong with looking at furry women with these!\u201d, she lifted both her breasts.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHey! Leave him alone!\u201d, and they both went quiet and looked down, \u201dhe\u2019s only 14, and he has not yet been with a woman\u201d, I looked at Bryan, \u201dwhat was it you want?\u201d<br>\r\nBryan; \u201dEarl Sarwyck and Sir Westford are waiting just outside with Cato Frost, leader of the Wolf Warriors, and Duke Gregor Forrester of Ironrath and Gregor\u2019s heir, Rodrik Forrester\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWait just a minute, Bryan\u201d, I turned to Akita and the Vixens, \u201dif you three don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to talk to them privately\u201d, Sheila and Artica bowed and moved past Bryan (but not before both gives him a peck on his cheeks!), Akita, however, wanted to take off the bandage first. Once she\u2019s done, she gives me a mirror so I could see the scars on the left side of the face: from the two claws of the Dragon-kin I got one that goes from the forehead and down to beneath the left eye, and the other one was as bit on the right and is of the same length as the first (use your imagination). Then she left to join the other two. \u201dBryan, please remind me to dress them\u201d, he simply nodded in response, \u201dnow, let them in please\u201d.</span></div></div>",

He has taken no wife or fathered any children, because he\u2019s dedicating his life to defend the North from all enemies. His shoulder length hair and thick beard are a bit more gray than brown and he\u2019s wearing a leather shirt over chainmail.<br>\r\nGregor Forrester is the Duke of Ironrath and the most loyal of my vassals (last time I saw him was at the coronation day). Called \u201dthe Good\u201d, he\u2019s an honorable man and a talented warrior who is known to be a loving father (although one of his sons went to exile). His hair and beard are grayish brown and is also wearing chainmail and leather.<br>\r\nHis son Rodrik Forrester, the heir to Ironrath, has been trained from birth to bear the burden of leadership and responsibility of his house. He\u2019s known to have an iron will and it is said that he\u2019s a man built for the position and is a formidable warrior. Rodrik is currently betrothed with Elaena of House Glenmore.<br>\r\nBehind the Forresters I see a young man with a leather west. He has brown hair and appears to be nearly twenty. Must be a squire of the Forresters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe; \u201dFrost, Forrester. Me and my comrades owe our lives to you and your men\u201d<br>\r\nCato Frost; \u201dOur honor for the realm, our lives for the king\u201d, he spoke with accent used by the people of the North and the Duchy of Ironrath.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSir Mors anticipated that the Wolf Warriors would come, but we didn\u2019t expect the men of Ironrath would show up!\u201d, I laughed and they joined.<br>\r\nGregor Forrester; \u201dMy family and House Glenmore were heading to Camelot. Rodrik here wanted to see if this ruin is really cursed\u201d<br>\r\nRodrik Forrester; \u201dI\u2019m not the superstitious type, and father here refused let me ride alone so he came along with fifty from our household guard\u201d<br>\r\nGregor Forrester; \u201dBut as we got close we encountered a Wolf Warrior scout who warned us about the Dragon-kin that prowled around Wood\u2019s Mark\u201d<br>\r\nCato Frost; \u201dOf course we didn\u2019t know that Gorn was leading them. Another of our scouts sneaked around the ruins and saw Mors killing him and the fighting broke out. And according to him, you and your companions slice through the Dragon-kin like wheat in a field!\u201d<br>\r\nGregor Forrester; \u201dBut we couldn\u2019t just stand by and let them slaughter you all, so our two groups joined forces\u201d<br>\r\nRodrik Forrester; \u201dThe archers of Rillwater Crossing are the best in Saxony Peninsula. They discreetly killed off the dragon bowman that remained\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThey certainly surprised both them and us! And the arrows just rained down like a rain of death, just before all of you rode them down!\u201d, everyone in the room laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the laughing stopped, the men of House Forrester introduced Gared Tuttle, Duke Gregor\u2019s squire and nephew of the Castellan of Ironrath, Duncan Tuttle. When I asked about what their opinions of my facial scars, Rodrik said that I \u201dlook like hell\u201d, and another laugh came along. And then we started talking about the direwolf pups. Cato said that the white wolf is the sigil of House Frost, so he would like to give the albino pup to his nephew, Duke Endrew. Rodrik wanted one for himself and Gregor wanted one for his youngest children. And I gladly accepted that, but not before telling about the responsibility of the pups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater we went to the courtyard. Akita really did wonderful magic on my body, I only feel a bit tired! The rest of my group (plus Walder) were much tougher than I thought, based on the injuries (like Mors and Alester). We all gathered around the pit were I see the stone trapdoor open, with what looks like stone-steps. Turns out that as soon Legolas finished reading it, it open by itself.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat do all of you think is down there?\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dDo not know. No elf has ever heard of this, High or Wood\u201d<br>\r\nWalder; \u201dFrom the look of it, it seems that the High Elves who lived here had this trapdoor buried deep, left it in a hurry and forgotten about it\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dAnd Gorn had this among his belongings\u201d, he held up a glowing stone, \u201dthis one once belonged to the High Elves and is well known by us dwarfs. Only glows when it gets closer to another stone like this, and if you hover it over a map it will glow stronger until the location is found\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd Gorn probably thought the elves left behind a powerful weapon, one he could use to rule all over Aeryn\u201d, wild guess I know.<br>\r\nPatrek; \u201dDragon-kin like Gorn aren\u2019t known to be smart\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dBut we need to find out what\u2019s down there\u201d, we all agreed on that, even Frost and the Forresters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved down the steps with my squire Bryan Connor, Westford, Sarwyck, Legolas, Gimli, Sir Thomas Marshall, my bodyguards Sir John and Sir Adrian Connor, Cato Frost and some of his Wolf Warriors, Duke Gregor Forrester and his son Rodrik, along with some of their men and the squire, Gared Tuttle. The others, Patrek and Walder, stayed behind.<br>\r\nAs we descend with torches in hands, I decided inquire, \u201dDuke Forrester?\u201d.<br>\r\nGregor Forrester; \u201dYes, Your Majesty?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe tourney isn\u2019t until several weeks from now\u201d<br>\r\nGregor Forrester; \u201dWell, my children were a bit impatient to see the capital for the first time, so I thought why not?\u201d, I chuckled to that, \u201dby the way\u2026 Have you named your pup yet?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy yes. His name is Balto. And he\u2019s the one with his blue eyes opened\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dMine is named Summer\u201d<br>\r\nRodrik Forrester; \u201dIsn't it a bit strange? Never heard of a blue-eyed direwolf\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou\u2019re right. Who knows what color he would have on his fur\u201d, I paused, \u201dhow deep is this anyway?\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dAye! Never thought High Elves would dig this deep?\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dFeels deeper than Wood\u2019s Mark\u2019s dungeons. What is that they were trying to hide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, I reached the last steps by a doorless opening. As we all passed through it, we\u2019re inside some kind of a massive, dark cave. The light from our torches didn\u2019t reach enough.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWow\u201d, it suddenly echoed. I thought it was fun, \u201dWow!\u201d, and Bryan joined in.<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dThat proves it. It\u2019s a giant cave\u201d, he laughed a bit.<br>\r\nI looked around a bit, and saw next to the opening another glowing stone stuck into the wall. I asked Gimli for the stone he had in his pocket.<br>\r\nAs I got closer, the stones glow brighter. And when the stone touched, there\u2019s suddenly another stone glowing on the other wall beside the opening. And more and more and more stones glow, filling the big cave with light. \u201dWell that\u2019s new\u201d I said before we all at what the cave really was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive treasure chamber!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the cave stretches there\u2019s plates, boxes and chests with all kinds of jewelry, diamonds, sapphires, statuettes, cups, pearls and coins made of silver and gold.<br>\r\nGregor Forrester; \u201dWhat the bloody hell is this?\u201d, he said it as walk through the treasures.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dThe High Elves left all this behind?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dAll this, beneath Wood\u2019s Mark the whole time?\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dArthur\u201d, I looked at him and was about to remind about the present company (he and his brothers usually only calls me by my first name in private) before he keeps talking, \u201dWood\u2019s Mark is currently in possession of the crown, since the days of Alaric \u201dthe Mad\u201d, right?\u201d, I nodded, \u201dThen that means\u2026 That you\u2019re the richest king in all of Middle Earth!!!\u201d, it echoed across the whole cave...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I just kept on walking pass the piles of treasures in the cave. I simply just couldn\u2019t believe it. Generations of Earls lived above it and for five centuries the crown held the land in possession, and yet no one had ever thought of what was beneath the ruins of the High Elven colony. And now I\u2019m richer than the Blackadders\u2026 Hell, even richer than not only the King of Bretonnia and the Emperor of Sigmar, but also richer than all the merchant cities of Tilea combined (maybe I exaggerate a bit)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, I was nearing the edge of the cave and saw another surprise\u2026 weapons, hundreds of them!<br>\r\nSwords (long, short and great), knifes, daggers, spears, bows and arrows. Whole rows of them, covered in dust and cobwebs.<br>\r\nThe others were not far behind and eventually joined me looking at the weapons in awe.<br>\r\nGared Tuttle; \u201dWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nCato Frost; \u201dAye\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI started inspecting some of the swords, along with Gimli and Legolas.<br>\r\n\u201dThese swords are certainly not made by any dwarf\u201d, Gimli said looking at a shortsword. \u201dNor where they by any smith among men\u201d, I replied as I look at the longsword I\u2019m holding. I pulled the weapon from its sheath. The metal shined as if it were freshly forged. Legolas too pulled a shortsword from its sheath and looked closer at the blade, \u201d(Made by my kin)\u201d, he said in elvish.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dLegolas?\u201d<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dAll these weapons are Elven forged. By the High Elves of Ulthuan\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dMaybe during the age of colonization!\u201d, I said in low voice. The others checks the rest of weapons. Each one are awed by the weapons they\u2019re inspecting. I watch Gared see a longsword, takes it, and pulls it fully from the sheath and inspects the blade in his hand. He then seems to be in deep thoughts, so I approached to his side.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs it to your liking?\u201d, he turns to me wide-eyed, surprised of me appearing.<br>\r\nGared; \u201dUh\u2026 Y-yes, Your Majesty. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted a sword like this. But I don\u2019t know if I deserve to wield this\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dA warrior with honour and a good heart always deserves a blade like this\u201d<br>\r\nRodrik Forrester; \u201dAnd you could not wish for a better blade!\u201d, he call out. Gared smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walk past the elven weapons, most of the others took a few souvenirs of their own:<br>\r\nWhile Gimli was content with his axes, Legolas took a curved shortsword and as many arrows he could carry.<br>\r\nCato and his warriors are also content with their weapons.<br>\r\nDuke Gregor and his son Rodrik each took a long knife. The duke took a longsword for his brother-in-law, Sir Malcolm Branfield.<br>\r\nSir Mors Westford inspected a longsword and a greatsword, and decided to take them both.<br>\r\nSir John Connor, my friend and trusted bodyguard, took a longsword and a few daggers.<br>\r\nBryan Connor, my squire and John\u2019s youngest brother, carefully inspected a shortsword. I told him he could keep it, and added that it will glow if orcs or goblins would happen to get close by.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck just looks on as he already owns an elven blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found Sir Thomas Marshall and John\u2019s and Bryan\u2019s brother Adrian further in. That they\u2019re among swords doesn\u2019t surprise me. What surprise me is that the swords they\u2019re checking out, swords of different sizes, are white. At least a few dozen white swords.<br>\r\n<i>White</i>, I thought, <i>seven warriors in white protecting me</i>. Marshall and the Woman Knight were among them. Seven who would dedicate their lives to protect and die for their king.<br>\r\n<i>Kingsguard</i>. I smile at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the thought ended, I notice Sir Thomas inspect both a longsword and a greatsword while Adrian were holding one unsheathed sword on each hand, testing how they feel.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnything for the two of you to keep?\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dI\u2019ll keep these two\u201d, motioning to the different-sized swords.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dWhile these longswords aren\u2019t nearly light as a feather, they\u2019re light enough for me. I\u2019m still amazed that even after centuries and millennia down here, they still look new!\u201d, I agreed on that.<br>\r\nAnd I now have plans for all these white swords\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to me. Did Sir Thomas speak?<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI thought you had a vow of-\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dSilence\u2026 I broke it when I prayed for Abbot Marcus\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhere you close?\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dNot really\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nI decided to inquire about one thing, \u201dWhy were you two heading to Camelot?\u201d<br>\r\nHe was silent for a minute, before he spoke again, \u201dMy father was a household knight and served a baron who was a vassal of House Redlion. Father was among those who were killed by Roose Blackadder. I was only ten years old that time and mother had died of fever the year before, so I decided to train to be warrior. I squired for the baron\u2019s son and was trained by the castle\u2019s master-at-arms for six years, until the son knighted me, and then I left Albion and traveled the roads as a hedge knight for nearly a year. I searched for a purpose in my life, and I arrived at the city of Altdorf. I went inside the Great Temple to make a silent prayer, and that\u2019s when a templar joined me in the prayer. And that\u2019s when I decided to join the Templar Knights of the Faith at the age of seventeen, the youngest templar in history, and not long afterwards I was sent to the holy city of Tur\u00edn in southern Bretonnia, to protect the pilgrims traveling on the roads and fight orcs and goblins raiding the lands from the mountains. For many years I fought battle after battle defending the Faith, while forced to see the hypocrisy and greed of the priests and the nobles. I started to wonder what I was really fighting for and began to question my faith\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dLady Violet, my Royal priestess, said to me once that some men have returned from defending our faith only to find themselves questioning it\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dTrue enough. Ten years ago, I took the vow of silence in front of Abbot Marcus, and got sent to guard a temple in the Dukedom of Aquitaine in the western Bretonnia. Marcus came along. A month ago, he told me that my time with the templars was done, and that if we go to the cathedral in Camelot, the capital of my homeland, the bishop there would release me from my \u201dburden\u201d. He was a good man and I couldn\u2019t argue with him. But he was right, my time as a templar was done. We took a ship from a port to Albion. The ship's last stop was at Mercia however, so we rode and the rest you know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like after hearing Gorold\u2019s story about Sir Mors, I couldn\u2019t imagine myself in such situations.<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dNow let me ask you something. Is killing a noble thing?\u201d<br>\r\nThat made me think. And then, \u201dNo. It is not. Sir Robert, the marshal, told me that only the weak believe that what they do in battle is who they are as men. But I believe this: a life fought for others is a life worth living. That is a noble thing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just look at me for a minute, and says, \u201dand that is why I wish to serve you. You have courage and you have a good heart. And you have what it takes to be a great king. When I\u2019m no longer a templar, I wish to be your household knight, if you have me\u201d. I looked at him for a moment before replying, \u201dJohn and Adrian would be honored to have an experienced warrior like you in their ranks\u201d, I turned to look at Adrian, and he just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\nSir Thomas then kneels down and says, \u201dthen I am yours, Your Majesty. I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life to yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the old gods and the new\u201d.<br>\r\nI put my right hand on his shoulder, \u201dAnd I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise\u201d.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not everyday that a templar would pledge his services to someone before his templar-vows have ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we all walk back up the stairs, we discussed about how get the treasures and the weapons out. I said that the weapons will go to the royal armory, and a few chests will go to the treasury in the castle. The cave is from now a second royal treasury. The castle itself will be torn down and I shall build a lightly fortified summer castle and royal residence for House Pendragon. It will be called Dragonhall. And Legolas and Gimli assured everyone that the trapdoor made of stone is magically protected and can only be opened by words spoken from an elf, not a human. I then asks them both if they wish to stay in my service (I do need an elf to open the door after all!), and they accepted.<br>\r\nI still need carts to transport the bounty. I better send a pigeon to the capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we came back to the surface, we got ourselves a big surprise\u2026 A young man in armor riding on a griffon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cato Frost and his men doesn\u2019t seemed shocked like the rest of us though. He simply walked up to the man who dismounts the griffon which just lays down on the courtyard grounds. He then bends on one knee before the man picks him up and they hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I realized that it\u2019s Endrew Frost, the Duke of the North\u2026</span></div></div>",

Their claws, which are reminiscent of a hawk\u2019s talons, are kept sharp by regular scoring against stone.<br>\r\nThey are voracious predators, flying out for miles to hunt from their mountain lairs. Griffons then swoop down on their prey, screaming war cries as they come. The cry of a Griffon is often enough to send enemies running. For the Griffon, This is an ideal situation as it prefers its meals on the run, and alive. They then continue to attack until no opponent is left moving. Survivors of the Griffon attacks often have dreams of being hunted down and rent limb from limb for years afterward. Despite being large and monstrous creatures, Griffons have reputations of as noble beasts. This is in part due to their proud and regal bearing - Griffons are not ravenous and frenetic like Manticores (creatures in the underworld). Instead A Griffon strikes with swift and precise grace, its motion poised and controlled. Yet this elegance in no way undermines its deadliness, for a Griffon is more than capable of using its talons and razor beak to rip a foe apart. Skilled and efficient fighters, Griffons do not kill indiscriminately, although they show no reluctance when hunting or protecting their territory. They are fierce and merciless, but never cruel.<br>\r\nGriffons prefer their meat raw and screaming, though they\u2019ll scavenge if no prey presents itself This is fairly rare though, as their hunting grounds tend to range for miles around their chosen mountain aerie. Their eyesight is sharp and they can see motion from miles away.<br>\r\nAs a result of a Griffon\u2019s possession of a noble temperament and an impressive intelligence, they can be trained as loyal and deadly mounts. For anyone to have the slightest hope of mastering a Griffon, the beast must be captured and trained while young, forging a bond that only death can shatter. Griffons are prized for their sharp claws and powerful beaks which rivals Greatswords (elite units of the Empire) in their deadliness.<br>\r\nThe Griffon is a sacred symbol in the Empire of Sigmar which appears frequently adorning temples, chapels and churches dedicated to the Faith. It is no coincidence that the Order of the Griffon was so named. Emperor Karl Franz himself enters battle on the back of Deathclaw, his personal Griffon mount. As well as the Empire, the High Elves also use Griffons as mounts. Many Griffons dwell in the mountains in Ulthuan, where they are more colorful than the ones in Middle-earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s commonly known that a few Griffons live in southern Ynys Wydryn (the Frozen Teeth) in the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Griffon\u2019s cat part is of a lion. It looks a bit smaller than other Griffons, but it doesn\u2019t look dangerous at all. Its eyes don\u2019t have the look that would scare people, it looks rather friendly. When Duke Endrew pets its head, it closes its eyes and purrs (or something like that). I have never heard of such things.<br>\r\nEndrew Frost; \u201dShe\u2019s named Ygritte. Three years ago, her mother crashed beneath the walls of Frost Wolf, wounded. The mother laid an egg with the last of her strength, the egg of which became Ygritte. I decided to adopt her, despite my mother's protests. As she grew up, we notice that she\u2019s not like the other Griffons we heard of. She has a rather friendly nature and she enjoys raw meat from the kitchens. And she loves flying, and last year she indicated me to ride on her back. Since then I became the first northerner to fly\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd everyone in the North has kept quiet until now\u201d, the others just looked at her in awe.<br>\r\nEndrew Frost; \u201dWant to try and pet it?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\nHe simply took the wrist of my ungloved right hand and placed it on Ygritte's head. She made a lovely sound and presses her head further on my hand.<br>\r\nThe duke\u2019s uncle interrupts, \u201dmy nephew. The king and I have a gift for you\u201d. I told Walder and Bryan to bring the basket. By the time they came back I had told Endrew about the direwolf mother. Cato picked up the albino pup and handed it to Endrew, \u201dWhite as the symbol of our house, and red eyes like the sword\u201d. Ygritte was curious and the pup seemed to be trying to move towards her. After Endrew bent down so they got closer, I laughed when the pup licked her beak.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dA brave little pup, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; I still think it will die quicker than the others\u201d<br>\r\nEndrew Frost; \u201dI think not, sir. For this one is mine\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe later named it Ghost. And the pup that Rodrik Forrester received, was named Grey Wind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before we started our way to Camelot, I said goodbye to both Dukes Forrester and Frost.<br>\r\nEndrew said that he will rejoin his party that\u2019s heading to the capital and that although he\u2019s not fond of tourneys, some of the North\u2019s warriors are planning to compete in the melee.<br>\r\nGregor\u2019s party will be setting up camp near the walls when they arrive. His youngest daughter, Talia Forrester, gets one of the female pups (her brothers let her have it while she shares it with them). I chuckled when I heard she named it Nymeria! (Nymeria was the name of a warrior princess who lived in Estalia in the ancient times)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy group included of course Sir Mors Westford, Earl Alester Sarwyck, my squire Bryan Connor, my bodyguards Sir John Connor, Sir Adrian Connor, Sir Thomas Marshall, Legolas and Gimli. And I reluctantly allowed Akita the dragoness and the Vixens Sheila and Artica to come along, and we all rode ahead the rest to Camelot (I\u2019m a bit surprised that those three could ride). Mors\u2019 men, Walder and Patrek, took the other way to help the Sarwycks with keeping order in their lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, we were not far from Diocletia when we set up camp for the night. We will reach it by the next night. And I have no doubt that Lord Herbert, Sir Robert, Lady Selena, Geecku and the household guard will be waiting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting down in the west as we started our dinner beside the road. I fed my pup, Balto, while Bryan fed the two unnamed direwolf pups remaining, one male and one female. Akita and the Vixens are having their dinner at another fire, a bit away from our fire. Only they eat vegetables.<br>\r\nWhile we eat, we hear something from down the road west. Or rather someone. Sounds like a boy singing. It was soon close enough for us to see in the distance: two riders, one tall, one small. And the boy was singing a familiar song from Bretonnia. As they got close enough, I could properly see their appearances:<br>\r\nThe tall man has to be seven feet tall, and has a thick mass of sun-streaked hair, and he looks strong too. He was dressed with a thin shirt and leather trousers. He\u2019s riding on a destrier (tall, strong, splendid animal and often high spirited. Destriers give knights a majestic air at tournaments. They are normally the most valuable type of horse, being well bred and highly trained. Some even consider them too valuable to risk in war thus the courser (a warhorse) is the preferred mount for fighting.<br>\r\nThe boy is dressed in a peasant boy\u2019s clothing and he has a straw hat on his head. He looks to be around Brian Connor's age. He\u2019s riding a young palfrey.<br>\r\nBehind them I see two mules carrying a lot of packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped close to our camp. \u201dGood evening, m\u2019lords\u201d, he spoke with our common accent, but \u201dmy lords\u201d were pronounced \u201dm\u2019lords\u201d. I look up to the sky and said \u201dindeed it is\u2026 but I think it will rain soon\u201d, my companions chuckled at my joke while the tall man smiled and the boy laughed, \u201danyway, this is the first time I meet a hedge knight. Who do I have the honor to meet?\u201d, \u201dI\u2019m Sir Duncan, the Tall, and this is my squire, Egg\u201d, John laughed hearing that while I chuckled.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat\u2019s your real name, and where are you from?\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dNun-ya\u201d, we all looked at him in confusion.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNun-ya? What\u2019s nun-ya?\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dNun-ya business\u201d, and we all laughed, hard (even Mors, who doesn\u2019t laugh very often, if you know what I mean?). I have certainly never heard that before!<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dI stopped trying long ago. All I know is that he\u2019s an orphan from Couronne\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dBretonnia? Hard to believe as he speaks our language, despite the accent\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dI learned from a wandering monk, who also taught me to read\u201d, he does have a Bretonnian accent. He takes off the hat, revealing that he\u2019s bald.<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dMay we join you for the night? We\u2019re on our way to the tourney in Camelot, the earlier the better\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell of course you can!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we helped them with settling their horses and mules, Sir Duncan and Egg joined us in the dinner.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSo, Sir Duncan, you\u2019re from Albion I\u2019m guessing?\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dAye, from Camelot, the city not the castle\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dWhich part?\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dThe poorest. My mum died when I was born and I grew up in a orphanage. As I wasn\u2019t named when I was born, everyone simply called me Dunk\u201d, Me and the others laughed a little.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dYou never knew who you father was?\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dAll I know is that he was a giant\u201d, everyone gives an odd look.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dA giant?\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dYou're kidding, right?\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dHe's not, he\u2019s stronger than all of you combined!\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dPlease don\u2019t brag about that, Egg. Sure, I was taller than most children, and I do carry heavy things. My mum was a daughter of a merchant, and when they were Kislev she met a giant, and they fell in love, according to what mum told everyone. But she never saw him again, and when the merchant found out she was having me, a giant's bastard, he kicked her out to the poor streets, where an elderly couple took her in. When she died, they left me at the orphanage. Sixteen years ago, a knight passed by the orphanage and he took me as his new squire\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWho was this knight?\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dSir Arlan Pennytree, a hedge knight. His last squire died a few years earlier, and I was the replacement. And we\u2019ve been to many lands in Middle-earth. Bretonnia, Empire, Estalia, even the cities of Tilea. That was the way we lived: riding from keep to keep, taking service with this lord and that lord, fighting in their battles and eating in their halls until the war was done, then moving on. There were tourneys from time to time as well. Of course Sir Arlan had not ridden a tilt for twelve years since he faced Prince Gilles of Bretonnia, son and heir of the Royarch and namesake of the first Royarch of Bretonnia, Gilles \u201dthe Uniter\u201d. They rode against each again and again. Although he lost he deemed it a victory. \u201dIt is not every man who can boast that he broke seven lances against one of the finest knights in Bretonnia\u201d, he said. <i>That</i> is how I thought he would die\u2026 on the battlefield, not on the side of a muddy road\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe died?\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dHe used to watch the sunset and say to me, \u201danother day done and who knows what the morrow will bring us, eh, Dunk?\u201d. Well, one morrow brought the rains on my seventeenth birthday in the spring. The one after had brought wet gusty winds. And the next a chill. The fourth day the old man was too weak to ride. He was closer to sixty than to fifty. He knighted me before he passed, with his own sword. I heard it as the old man charged me to be a good knight and true, defend the weak and innocent, and defend the human race with all my might. And I swore I would. And he named me Sir Duncan the Tall\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dWhere there any witnesses?\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dOnly a wandering priest who helped me bury the old man and prayed for him\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dA priest that won\u2019t be easy to find\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat are you implying, Sir Mors?\u201d<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dForgive me Your Majesty, but hedge knights are beggars with blades at best, outlaws at worse\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dSir Arlan used to say \u201dDunk the Lunk, thick as a castle wall\u201d and referred to me as \u201dslow as an aurochs\u201d, but I\u2019m no liar. If I had lied now, my ears would have turned red\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dTrue\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then got curious about this boy. His bald head is like an egg, but his eyes is what interests me. They\u2019re emerald colored, but they seem to have hints of gold in them.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI do not mean to be rude, but why are you bald?\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dI shave it\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy?\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dNun-ya business\u201d, he\u2019s really stubborn, this one.<br>\r\nMe; \u201d(sigh) Then where were you from? And how did you end up being Sir Duncan\u2019s squire?\u201d<br>\r\nSir Duncan explained, \u201dAfter burying the old man, I rode to a small tourney in the Marches of Couronne. On the way I stopped by an Inn, and mistook Egg for a stableboy\u201d<br>\r\nEgg; \u201dI was running away and ended up there. He didn\u2019t look like a knight and his sword belt was made of rope!\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan the Tall; \u201dThat was before I sold one of the horses, a palfrey, and the old man\u2019s armour in order to acquire armor of my own from Steely Pate, a blacksmith from Albion. Egg begged me to be my squire when I left. I refused, left, and shortly thereafter arrived at the small keep where the tourney would be. I made camp, and the next evening I discovered this boy when I came back and see him cooking fish. Because I didn\u2019t have a squire, I accepted Egg as my squire for the duration of the tourney. In the end, I surprisingly won that tourney, and the melee, we\u2019ve been together for five years\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd you both have certainly been on a lot of adventures, I guess\u201d<br>\r\nDuncan smiled, \u201dIndeed we have, Sir\u201d, and Egg shouted, \u201denough for a thousand songs!\u201d, and we all laughed. And they both got surprised when I revealed that I\u2019m King Arthur and that me and my friends fought against Gorn and his dragon-kin and survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we have a pleasant conversation, Sir Duncan showed me his helm, the top\u2019s rounded and curved for a sword and an axe to slide off, it\u2019s closed faced but there\u2019s air holes, Duncan said that Steely Pate told him that visors are a point of weakness. And it\u2019s plain for the likes of him. He then showed his shield, which shows his personal arms: a green shooting star above an elm tree proper on sunset (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/e/e4/Dunk.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/e/e4/D...</a>).<br>\r\nI showed him one of the direwolf pups, a male, and allowed him to pet it. When he drew his hand back, it whimpered and I realized it choosed Duncan for his owner (interesting), so I gave it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Duncan the Tall named it Shaggydog\u2026</span></div></div>",

First I warned Duncan and Egg about the dragoness and the vixens. Then I get into my tent. Not long afterwards, Akita crawled in, naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should be telling to get out, but I couldn\u2019t. Her breasts jiggled and her hips swayed sideways as she got closer.<br>\r\nFinally, her dragon-face was over mine and her large breasts rested over my chest. Then she lowered her face to kiss me, and I kissed back passionately. I opened my mouth to let her long, reptile-like tongue to play with mine, and then I wrap around my arms to bring her closer, further presses her breasts onto my chest and her crotch grinds on mine. Then I get her off me so I can take my clothes off. As soon as I was done, Akita was over me again. Only this time, her pink crotch with purple lips of her pussy is over my face, while Akita has her face over my cock. She lowers her pussy onto my face at the same time she encircles her tongue around the cock before engulfing it whole in her mouth. She\u2019s good, I admit, and I lick her folds as fast as I could, making her moan. And a few minutes later, we came.<br>\r\nAkita then positioned her again so she has her pussy right on top on my dick. She has her hands on my shoulders and I have my hands on her hips, pushing her down to impale her. We both enjoy the sensation of my cock inside her. And then she moves her hips, slow at first, and increase her speed with every movement. I in turn pushes my hips upwards, making her breasts bounce. Without moving her hips, she leans forward and presses her breasts onto my face, and my mouth soon find one of her purple nipples and suck on it.<br>\r\nWe went on for over ten minutes, I think, before we came together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering from her daze after the mating, she see me sitting with my thoughts.<br>\r\nI asked her; \u201dWhy do you not have any horns or pointy spines?\u201d<br>\r\nShe sits up and wraps her arms around my waist and presses her breasts on my back, \u201dDon\u2019t know, I was born this way. Many of my father\u2019s tribe thought it was a bad omen, until the shaman lady proclaimed my powers and I shouldn\u2019t be treated differently. And I was a chieftain\u2019s daughter\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dDo you not miss your homeland?\u201d, I turn my head to look at her violet, reptile eyes.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dMy tribe was gone when Gorn took the lives of my family, I wouldn\u2019t survive alone on Aeryn. Now my home is with Sheila, Artica\u2026 and you, my king\u201d, she moves her forward to kiss me, but I turn my head away.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou don\u2019t understand. I have to marry a woman of a noble family, and I can\u2019t risk insulting that family by having mistresses, much less furries and a dragon\u201d, I even talked to Zandria and Geecku about this, but they\u2019re stubborn as Lord Herbert warned me.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dYou saved us, and it\u2019s a debt we will pay for the rest of our lives, with body and soul. And what we do is not wrong in any way. Don\u2019t think more of it tonight, lets just sleep\u201d, she pulls me down and now my head rest on her soft chest. And I soon fall asleep\u2026 and the last thought in my mind was two warriors from the dream who now have faces: Duncan, the tall knight, and the Griffon warrior, Endrew Frost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, everyone get out of their tents. Sheila Vixen volunteered to cook breakfast and we didn\u2019t see no reason for her not to. But we will soon see the reason\u2026<br>\r\nSheila, still naked as usual, brought a cauldron of stew and each of us have a bowl ready (although Egg is twelve years old, he\u2019s seen naked furries before). I watch Duncan take a bite out of the stew, and froze after one bite. Egg soon followed, and I tasted my stew and stopped as well. It tasted horrid! The chunks of meat were nothing but fat. The others just watched us. Not wanting to hurt Sheila\u2019s feelings, the three of us chewed our food and swallowed. I nodded trying to make her feel confident about her cooking, \u201dIt\u2019s good\u201d, \u201dReally?\u201d she asked happily. She squealed and hugged my head onto her chest, and then skipped off too Artica. The three of us looked at each other and Dunk and Egg shook their heads before pouring the stew on the ground. \u201dI pity the man she marries and cooks for\u201d, Egg mumbled. I don\u2019t know if it was a bad joke referring to me. But I just nodded and poured my stew.<br>\r\nAll three Connor-brothers spitted out their stew poured. Legolas himself just his own breakfast which included fruits (lucky elf, no offense). However, Alester, Mors, Marshall and Gimli just it whole.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dHad eaten worse\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dMe too\u201d<br>\r\nWhen Akita turned, wrapped her body with a blanket and eating her own stew, John started to ask, \u201dGimli here told me this strange thing. He said that you met my grandfather when he adventured around the islands\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dGimli has a good memory, as he was a young dwarf accompanying your grandfather. And your father was a small child at the time\u201d<br>\r\nAll of us look at her skeptically. Adrian laughed and said, \u201dThen you must be at least 60\u201d, Akita smiled as she shook her head. Adrian gave an confused look and asked \u201d70?\u201d, to which she shake her head again, \u201dYou cannot be 80!\u201d. \u201d87\u201d, she answered. Now I\u2019m really confused!<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dWe dragon-kin are blessed with long life, thanks to our dragon-blood. We can live up to 300 years\u201d, well that is interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, we readied our horses to continue our journey. But just before we get on our saddles, I hear something in the distance and looked west. What could it be this time? I look down the road, to see a large group heading this direction. It was a small caravan of riders and wagons. What surprises me is that some of the riders are herding a group of over a dozen horses. But not just any horses\u2026 They\u2019re Bretonnian Warhorses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finest breed of warhorse in Middle-earth (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/9/96/0e140981212169924bf9e63050ccdf1d.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150812034159\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/warh...</a>). This is because the Bretonnian Warhorse is in part, are the descendants of the Elven Steeds of the former Elven colonies which flourished millennia ago in the land that is now Bretonnia. When the Elven colonists abandoned Middle-earth and sailed back to Ulthuan (home of the High Elves), some remained behind. These Elves were the ancestors of the Wood Elves. One of the Elven kindreds that stayed took their Elven Steeds with them into the safety of the forest glades. Elsewhere, herds of Elven Steeds roamed freely in the meadows and plains around the abandoned Elven ruins, interbreeding with wild forest ponies. This mingling of blood eventually resulted in the creation of a new breed of horse known simply as the Bretonnian Warhorse.<br>\r\nThis new breed of horse was far superior in size and spirit than any other in Middle-earth and the only breed to have blood of the Elven Steeds in their veins. While horses of the Empire and Kislev are better suited to a harsher climate, the Bretonnian breed requires the lush meadows of Bretonnia\u2019s landscape. When the Bretonnian warriors began riding into battle on the native horses of Bretonnia, they found that the horses could bear the weight of a fully armored man and still gallop and charge over and over again without tiring. The horses were big, powerful and not lacking in stamina. The Bretonnian knights therefore made every effort to maintain and improve their special breed. A very important factor in this was the peace pact with the Wood Elves in the southern Bretonnian woods. By the terms of this pact, from time to time the Elves allow the Bretonnians to have some of their precious steeds. In this way the Bretonnian horses are replenished with fresh blood from pure Elven stock. Bretonnian knights owe their success not only to their own valor and skill, but also to the endurance and temper of their steeds.<br>\r\nNaturally, only a noble is permitted to ride a warhorse, though a few lucky and trusted peasants may be allowed to act as grooms and stablehands, and thus sleep in the same barn as one. Squires must make do with forest ponies and lesser breeds lacking the blood of the Elven Steeds. So highly valued are these beasts that a Royal Decree of many centuries standing forbid the export of these magnificent animals. The Bretonnian knights naturally do not want anyone else to be as well mounted as they are. Even so, a man would have to have the stature and nobility of a true Bretonnian knight to ride a Bretonnian Warhorse. They do not put up with lesser warriors on their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how is it that it\u2019s now here in Albion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo riders approach us: a middle aged knight riding on a destrier and a young man riding on a Bretonnian Warhorse with black fur. \u201dGreetings, my lords\u201d, said the older knight, \u201dyou don\u2019t happen to be heading to the capital, do you?\u201d, \u201dIndeed we are, Sir, and it\u2019s easy to find. I should know, because the city is mine\u201d, \u201dAhh! The King himself before us! Well, were are my manners, I am Sir David Hospital, Your Majesty\u201d, I look at the younger knight. He has a shoulder length black hair, black beard, and brown eyes (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cineplex.media.baselineresearch.com/images/193754/193754_full.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cineplex.media.baselineresearch.c...</a>). What interests me is that he\u2019s dressed in a uniform of Ibelin, the seat of Godfrey of Ibelin (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mittelalter.net/bilder/assassins-creed-wappenrock-loewenherz---15805.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.mittelalter.net/bilder/assas...</a>). Two standing lions facing away each other, counterchanged, on a red and white filed. And what\u2019s more, is that he has Godfrey\u2019s sword (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.swordsknivesanddaggers.com/kas/Kingdom_of_Heaven_Sword_of_Ibelin_Short_Medieval_Dagger.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.swordsknivesanddaggers.com/k...</a>)!<br>\r\n\u201dAnd who is he to hold the sword Godfrey, the Baron of Ibelin!\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\nDavid Hospital; \u201dOh.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out in the distance in the east, but in the other side of the road, I see a knight and a squire heading to this direction. They stopped just a few hundred meters away from the road, but still in hearing reach. The knight lifts his visor of his helm and reveals a familiar face despite the distance: Stephen Clifford, a son to one of the local barons loyal to Countess Maria Lennon of Diocletia. He and I trained together in swordplay and horse riding when he was just a squire. He\u2019s two years older than me and was knighted on his birthday more than two years ago. Haven\u2019t seen him since.<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no trace of hair on his face, but it shows a lot of anger for some reason. I was just about to call out when he points at the herd of Bretonnian Warhorses and shouts, \u201dThat is MY herd!\u201d.<br>\r\nThe man called Balian said, \u201dWhy would this be your herd?\u201d.<br>\r\nStephen Clifford; \u201dBecause they are on MY lands!\u201d, what?<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dI took these horses from the sea\u201d<br>\r\nStephen Clifford; \u201dYou are a great LIAR, and I will fight you because you are a liar!\u201d, what is he doing?!<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dI have no desire to fight\u201d<br>\r\nStephen Clifford; \u201dThen you MUST give me the warhorses!\u201d<br>\r\nI see Balian sigh before he gets off the horse, and walks across the road, away from the camp and the caravan. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to be harm in the fight he\u2019s forced into. He stops, turn to Stephen\u2019s direction and pulls the sword from the sheath and holds it with both hands above his head. <i>La posta del falcone</i>. \u201dNo\u201d, said Balian for Stephen to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to put a stop to this. Stephen wouldn\u2019t deny his friend and king? I ran onto the road and shouted to him, \u201dSir Stephen Clifford! I\u2019m Arthur Pendragon, your king! We trained together as children, remember?!\u201d, he doesn\u2019t seem to pay attention. He just looks angrily at Balian and closes his visor, \u201dSir Stephen!\u201d, his squire gives him his throwing spear, and appears to be trying to tell Stephen about me but the knight doesn\u2019t seem to listen to him either, \u201dSir Stephen stop!\u201d.<br>\r\nBut Stephen just rides off and charges at Balian. When he gets close enough, he throws at Balian\u2026 who suddenly deflects it! How the hell did he do that?! Stephen turns his horse around to charge again, this time with his longsword drawn. Balian deflects it too.<br>\r\nI turned to Bryan and said, \u201dGet me my horse, NOW!\u201d, and he hurries off. I watch Balian still stand defensively and look at Stephen.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dFight me fairly!\u201d<br>\r\nStephen Clifford; \u201dWhy? Why should I, thief?! I am a knight\u201d, why is he calling him thief? Why is he doing this?!<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dAnd I am the Baron of Ibelin\u201d, what?<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBaron of\u2026 Ibelin?\u201d, I look at the others, who are just as confused. Bryan brought my horse.<br>\r\nStephen Clifford; \u201dThe Baron of Ibelin is old! I knew him years ago!\u201d, now he\u2019s barely ten feet away.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dI am the new one\u201d, new one? What happened to Godfrey?!<br>\r\nI got up on my horse while Stephen got off his to fight on foot. When he starts attacking Balian, who deflects his attacks, I rode up to get close enough. I shouted commands, telling Stephen to stop, even Balian tried to him to listen to me. But Stephen doesn\u2019t seem to listen to anything or anyone, he just keeps attacking. I ran out of patience and decided to get my horse between them. As I rode up the middle I shouted, \u201dStephen! I command y-\u201d, but Stephen doesn\u2019t seem to notice the horse getting in front of him, and suddenly swing his sword and cuts its throat! And as it falls forward, I get launched off the saddle and land on the ground rolling. Definitely a bad idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ears ring and my head hurt. I barely hear voices around me, and then I feel someone pick me up. My vision is a bit blurry, but when it got better, I see Sir David Hospital, Alester and Bryan. I then hear angry voices on my left, I turn my head and see Stephen being pinned down by Mors and Duncan. I quickly get angry, stand up and march towards him. How dare he do something like that! And why fight a man for horses?! Even if they\u2019re Bretonnian Warhorses!<br>\r\nMors keep telling him to calm down but Stephen, who is without his helm, still don\u2019t seem to listen to reason. I stand by his head with Excalibur drawn and with the blade downward. I then pierce the tip to the ground right next to Stephen\u2019s head\u2026 and THAT shut him up.<br>\r\nHe shockingly looked at the blade and slowly look up at the owner, me.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAre you blind <i>and</i> deaf?\u201d, I said it with an animal growl.<br>\r\nStephen; \u201dW-w-what?\u201d, he sounded confused, but also scared, and he should be.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dDidn't you hear me? Didn\u2019t hear your king give you commands? Did you not see my horse get in front of you?!\u201d<br>\r\nHe just looks at me with mixture of shock and fear. \u201dWELL?!\u201d, I shouted. When I still got no answer, I grab his collar and pull him up so that we\u2019re face-to-face. \u201dListen to me very carefully, knight\u201d, I hissed, \u201duntil it\u2019s proven that the horses are yours and not his, you don\u2019t get to kill him, my friends won\u2019t get to kill him, <i>I</i> get to kill him! And I am <i>King of Albion</i> you arrogant cunt, <i>your</i> king! And if you dare to do a thing like that again, and I swear that I will shove this sword so far up your arse that not even your own <i>mother</i> will find!!!\u201d. I breath very heavily and just look at him in the eyes with anger. No around us have no idea what to do.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Stephen\u2019s underlip began to shiver and he starts to sob while he speaks, \u201dI'm sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t see it was really you\u2026 My squire\u2026 He spotted the caravan\u2026 Before it got here\u2026 And saw the horses\u2026 no Bretonnian knights\u2026 Always wanted one\u2026 Remember\u2026 I got jealous\u2026\u201d, \u201dAs far as I can see, you don\u2019t deserve one!\u201d, I shouted to his face, \u201dAnd I thought you were my friend\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then hear horses coming. I turn my head and see a large group of knights heading towards us, led by Stephen\u2019s father, Baron Harold Clifford. \u201dWhat has happened here?\u201d, said the baron when he stopped, \u201dAsk your son\u201d, I replied before whispering to Stephen, \u201dThe only reason I let you live, is because of your father, you pathetic whimp\u201d, and then I shove him to the ground. I know I shouldn\u2019t have called him that, but I do not tolerate such a behavior.<br>\r\nThe horse was a destrier named Strider, and I\u2019ve been riding on his back since I was twelve. I petted on his head, even though he\u2019s now dead.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dWas this horse dear to you?\u201d, I didn\u2019t notice him until now.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe was gift on my twelfth birthday, from Godfrey\u2026 The <i>true</i> Baron of Ibelin\u201d, I rose up and turned towards and was now only inches from his face. I noticed that he\u2019s a bit taller than, but much shorter than Sir Duncan, \u201dWho, the hell, are you?\u201d<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dAs Sir David have told you, I\u2019m Balian\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou have Godfrey\u2019s sword. What the hell have you done with him?!\u201d<br>\r\nDavid Hospital; \u201dHe\u2019s dead, Your Majesty\u201d, he was next to us all of sudden.<br>\r\nMe and my companions looked at him shocked. \u201dDead?\u201d, asked Alester, \u201dBut he\u2019s a formidable warrior, how?\u201d, said Mors.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dWe were ambushed when we rode to Castle Brionne, he died from his wounds several days later\u201d, he receives a parchment from sir David and hands it to me, \u201dTo you and the Counsel\u201d.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\u201dArthur, my king and best student of the sword. If you read this, then I have departed to the afterlife. I am sorry for not having attended your coronation and not telling of my journey that started months ago. The reason for my travel is the man that now has my sword. His name is Balian, and he is my son. Illegitimate son. I met his mother when I rode through a village within my family\u2019s lands. I was the new Baron of Ibelin then, and married, but I did not force her. I think that as soon she found she was having Balian in her womb, she fled from Albion so she wouldn\u2019t risk the wrath of my wife, who unfortunately couldn\u2019t give me children. When she passed last year, I decided to find Balian\u2019s mother, and whatever child we had, as I want an heir to my domains. I had sent out reliable men to search for her. But sadly she had passed years before, in Bastonne, a dukedom in Bretonnia. Our son, however, was adopted by a local blacksmith who took him in as an apprentice. He then got the attention of a knight who took him as a squire, and trained him to fight with sword. When the knight died in a duel a few years ago, Balian went to be a blacksmith and married a pretty, Bastonnian woman. But their child died during childbirth, and it caused her to commit suicide. I still wanted to see him, and when me and my men found him much later, he was still grieving. After a brief talk, where I revealed to him that I\u2019m his father and I asked for forgiveness, he initially refused to come with me. After we left for Brionne, however, Balian had caught up with while riding halfway through Forest of Ch\u00e1lons. He said he had done murder, but I don\u2019t care. Before we crossed the river to Aquitaine, three knights and a few mounted Yeomen came to take Balian. I offered a challenge to a duel, but the leader laughed and had a Yeoman shoot arrow at my right ribs. But as the the leader marched towards my son while holding his helmet, I suddenly raised my sword and plunged it on his head, shattering it and killing him, and the arrow split in half as a result. But the death of their leading knight served as a warning and they rode off. When we came to Castle Brionne less than a week later, I\u2019m near death. And now I have a servant writing this down for me before I knight my son. Please have him legitimized and accept his claim to Ibelin. If you wonder about the warhorses, let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s one of two debts that Duke Theodoric owned me. The other being ships to take Balian and everything home. He\u2019s the only sin that I do not regret in this life. And I am proud of being your teacher and I know for certain that you\u2019re born for greatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodfrey of Ibelin\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I finished reading it I handed it to Alester and told him to read it aloud to the rest, and I walked away a bit.<br>\r\nI sat down on the grass and went deep into my thoughts. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. Godfrey, dead? If there was a place for him in the Council, I would gladly have him there.<br>\r\nBalian walk up, and silently sat down next to me.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSo, you\u2019re a knight?\u201d<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dNeither earned nor proved\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYour father was one of my greatest teachers. He thought me la posta del falcone\u201d<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dHe did with me too, before the arrow\u201d<br>\r\nI laugh a bit, \u201dHe does love to teach a man a lesson or two!\u201d, we both laughed a little.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dThe priest in the village where I lived, he beheaded my wife and took her trinket before burying her\u201d, he showed me the trinket he had around his neck, \u201dIt was my gift to her on our wedding day. The night father left, the priest mocked me for my grieving and told me what he did. I took back the trinket, before piercing a sword I was forging through him, and tossed him into the forge\u201d, I shed a few tears from hearing this story.<br>\r\n\u201dYour Majesty\u201d, I didn\u2019t notice him coming up behind us, \u201dWe have to get to Diocletia by nightfall\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dStephen\u2019s father offered to bury it\u201d<br>\r\nMe and Balian got up on our feet.<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dYou seem to be without a horse\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019ll probably take one of our other horses\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nBalian simply shook his head and beckoned me to follow him. He took me to the herd of Bretonnian Warhorses, and showed me a piebald (black and white spotting pattern) stallion.<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dFather wanted for you to have this one\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dReally?!\u201d<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dHe meant this to be a late coronation gift. <i>\u201dA horse worthy a king\u201d</i>, he told me\u201d<br>\r\nI carefully reached out my hand to the horse smell it. And then I rested my hand on its head, and then I started to pet more of it, \u201dWhen I was a little boy, all I wanted was a Bretonnian Warhorse. I heard all the stories about Bretonnian knights riding on them to fight monsters. But when I wished for one on my seventh birthday, Sir Robert told me that those horses will never be allowed outside Bretonnia. I cried myself to sleep that night\u201d, I then hugged the horse softly, \u201dAnd yet, here it is\u201d<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dDuke Theodoric told me his name is Miramis. It means \u201dNight Winds\u201d. Want to put a saddle on him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile hours away from Diocletia, and the joined caravan travels down the road to it, I rode fast around the fields with Miramis. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAD_E1kaYuY\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAD_E1ka...</a>) It\u2019s true of what they say: these horses don\u2019t lack any stamina. Miramis seem to enjoy riding through the wind as much as I do, and he sure don\u2019t object when I tell to go faster. I don\u2019t even have to use my feet! I let go of the reins and spread out my arms wide while enjoying the wind flowing on my face and laugh. Miramis joined in by neighing joyfully!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad things and good things in every day I suppose\u2026</span></div></div>",

I had my bodyguards (John and Adrian Connor, Thomas Marshall, Legolas and Gimli) and my squire, Bryan Connor, to take the night off. The Council is informed, while we all ate dinner with the rest, of the events after we left Riverspring: the direwolf pups, the battle with the dragon-kin at Wood\u2019s Mark, Akita and vixens (Geecku and Zandria were, surprisingly, pleased to meet them), the secret treasure chamber beneath the ruined keep and Balian and the Warhorses (reluctantly included the \u201dargument\u201d with Stephen). I\u2019m honestly surprised to see Earl Edwin, my Chancellor, and Zandria, my Spy Mistress, here and not in the capital. But I was told that there are some urgent matters that needs to be attended at once. And I knew it had to be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the meeting hall was emptied, so that I would be alone with the Council (a council must work on behalf of the realm undisturbed). Except for three men that I have never met before. As soon as the doors were closed, Earl Edwin introduced them to me, \u201dYour Majesty, this is William Tavington, Earl of Tavington Hall, and the men flanking him are his knights\u201d, the earl bowed before me. He seem to be between mid and late thirties, dressed in mostly green uniform and has his hair tied behind his head.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dLet\u2019s sit by the table\u201d, and we all (except Tavington\u2019s men) sat down by the table that\u2019s placed in the middle, to be used by the Council tonight.<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dEarl Tavington here came to the capital a few days ago, with a message from Duke Blackadder\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dAnd it\u2019s only for the Council and the king to hear\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs he demanding his old seat in the Council?

Not at all\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dIf he doesn\u2019t want his old seat, which is currently mine, then what does he want?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dNot what\u201d, he said looking at Sir Robert, \u201dWho\u201d, he turn to look at me. I don\u2019t like that smile of his.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dMy liege, Duke Roose Blackadder, wishes to have a grandson on throne\u201d, what?!<br>\r\nSir Robert chuckled as if it was a joke, while Lady Selena and Zandria looks at the count with suspicion.<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dYou mean he wishes the king to marry one of his daughters?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dMore specifically, the youngest of his daughters, who also happens to be one of His Majesty\u2019s cousins\u201d, that\u2019s true. Duke Roose is married to my aunt Rhonda of House Haytham, and through her he got two daughters, my cousins, named Victoria and Roselyn.<br>\r\nLady Violet; \u201dAre you referring to Roselyn Blackadder?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dCorrect, my lady. Although she likes to be nicknamed Rose, like the flower\u201d<br>\r\nLady Selena; \u201dIf I remember correctly, she\u2019s at the same age as our king?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dThat\u2019s also correct, they even have the same birthday!\u201d, huh, that\u2019s interesting, \u201dBut enough about that. My liege wishes for an answer before he arrives at the capital with family and court\u201d<br>\r\nEarl Edwin nearly choked on the cup of wine that was on the table, \u201dWhat?!\u201d. I was surprised too, I admit.<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dHe\u2019s on his way?\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dDon\u2019t the king get the chance to see her first before he decides?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYou want to count her teeth?!\u201d, said one of Tavington\u2019s knights, who earned a glare from his liege and shut up right away.<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dPlease excuse him, he fears the duke as much as anyone in Eastshire\u201d, and for a good reason, from what I\u2019ve heard from Alester and Mors, \u201dDuke Blackadder will arrive in the capital near the end of month\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI've never heard of him being that impatient?\u201d<br>\r\nWilliam Tavington; \u201dWhatever his reasons for it is not for me to know I\u2019m afraid\u201d<br>\r\nI thought for a moment, and said, \u201dWould you excuse us while we consider the duke\u2019s proposal?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dOf course not, Your Majesty\u201d, he replied, \u201dBut I have to ride back to him first thing in the morning\u2026 with your answer\u201d. he went out of the hall with his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the doors closed, I got up from the chair and went to stand by the fireplace.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dThe nerve!\u201d, he\u2019s a bit furious, no doubt.<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dCalm yourself Sir Robert\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dCALM? He not only have the nerve send such a demand, but he has it delivered by Tavington! By the gods, this is a man who\u2019s as ruthless as his liege!\u201d<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dEnough, Sir Robert! We need Blackadder back into the fold, and the tourney is the perfect opportunity as many of the king\u2019s vassals are coming, and they\u2019d be thrilled to witness a royal wedding and more importantly, Arthur needs an heir to the throne\u201d, he\u2019s right about that, \u201dand you know very well that Roose has the largest army on the island. An army and a fleet that we\u2019re in need of\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean\u201d, I turned from the fireplace.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWhile you and your companions rode to Wood\u2019s Mark, Edwin and I received word from Norsca\u201d, that name gives the shiver. It\u2019s the home of the Norse, also known as Vikings. They are often described as sea borne explorers, traders, reavers and slavers. Divided in tribes, they\u2019re ruled by \u201dJarls\u201d (somewhat similar to dukes).<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat of Norsca?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dIt appears that the Norse-tribes have been united after electing a king a few months ago\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dA King of whole Norsca? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dThey were promised an age of plunder and conquest, as in the ancient times before the unity of Albion, by a viking pirate named Euron Crow\u2019s Eye\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dCrow\u2019s Eye?! There are rumors that says he\u2019s more ruthless and sadistic than any viking alive!\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dAs ruthless and sadistic as he\u2019s unpredictable. The viking invasion that Arthur I Pendragon had defeated a thousand years ago at Badon was ten thousand strong. Rumors today says that the tribes together has over a thousand ships!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd if Crow\u2019s Eye aims for conquest\u2026 He would attempt to invade Albion\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \"And if a Norse ship have room for around thirty warriors, Euron\u2019s fleet of a thousand ships will carry thirty thousand of them\"<br>\r\nZandria; \"But there are those who claim that the Norse have double, or worse triple, that many warriors. Not including their allies, like the Norse-dwarfs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all silent for a moment, until I spoke up, \u201dAs it would seem, I have to marry Roselyn. I have been thinking on who would be a suitable queen, either a daughter of one of my vassals, or a princess from our neighboring kingdoms. Therefore, I must accept the proposal in an effort not to anger Duke Roose. I have no doubt about the fleets of my vassals: Duke Blackadder have over 200 warships and my grandfather Duke Haytham have at least 100. And Mercia of Mercia, Vectis of Vectis and Greystone of the Isle of Greystone have their own warships, no doubt. But Camelot? When was the last time we have an High Admiral leading the small Royal Fleet of 30 ships?\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dI agree. And the walls of the city can\u2019t hold off from reavers forever, as there are more cunning ways to get inside, history has proven that. And we didn't have an High Admiral since the tragedy outside Marienburg\u201d<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \"Along with our last Lawmaker\", both died along with my parents.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd I will try and find suitable candidates for one those two empty seats in the Council. And form one more\u201d, I smiled when I told them what I have in mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after giving our answer to Tavington, I walked to my room with Zandria. She\u2019s holding onto my left arm, pressing it between her large breasts. \u201dWho do you plan on mating with tonight?\u201d, she asked me, \u201dTo be perfectly honest, I hope to just have a good night\u2019s rest\u201d, I replied, \u201dSure I can handle you and Geecku, but five or more? I could die!\u201d, she just giggle as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were outside my room for the night, we could girly chattering from inside. I sighed, before Zandria cups my cheek and pulls me to a kiss. By instinct I wrap my arms around her waist while she wrap her own arms around my neck, presses her tits on my chest and wrap her tail around us. Our tongues dances with fury for a minute before we stopped, and she look into my eyes and said, \u201dYou\u2019re Edward\u2019s son, and a Pendragon, you can handle anything\u201d, \u201dBut my marriage with Roselyn\u2026\u201d, \u201dShe will understand in time. As for her father\u2026 only the gods will tell\u201d, she then drag into the room\u2026</span></div></div>",

All are naked while Zandria is wearing one of her special made dresses since before the Council meeting, but she quickly took it off and joined Geecku.<br>\r\nSheila Vixen; \u201dThese puppies are so cute!\u201d, she\u2019s snuggling with Balto.<br>\r\nArtica Vixen; \u201dBut who will have this one, I wonder?\u201d, referring to the female pup she\u2019s rubbing their noses with.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThat one will be my weeding gift to my future queen\u201d, I started to change to my sleepwear.<br>\r\nThe Vixens; \u201dQueen?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dHe\u2019s going to get married with Lady Roselyn of House Blackadder\u201d<br>\r\nSheila Vixen; \u201dI really don\u2019t understand this half of the world\u201d<br>\r\nArtica Vixen; \u201dMe neither. In Narnia, we marry for love, even if one is a commoner and one\u2019s a noble!\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dPolitical marriage is not uncommon in Aeryn\u201d<br>\r\nGeecku; \u201dGeecku think marriage is stupid\u201d, she often speak of herself in third person.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell I for one am hopping for having a family of my own. Being the only Pendragon feels kinda lonely\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI do hope you and the new queen will be happy\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dZandria, do you have spies in Durnovaria?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; I do\u2026 But there\u2019s not much to tell about your cousins since they and your aunt, Rhonda, are kept in a small keep outside the city\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dMaybe the Duke was worried or something. Still, it\u2019s near impossible for my spies to get in, since only guards loyal to Duke Roose and nuns from a nearby convent are permitted there. The nuns of that convent are a closely tight group, making it difficult to get an unfamiliar nun inside\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThen, what is there to tell about Roselyn?\u201d, I sat down on the bed.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dThat she and her sister, Victoria, are amongst the prettiest girls of the region. And Roselyn is having a romantic interest in you\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dReally?\u201d, I raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWhy yes! If rumors are true, she has pictures of you from childhood to today, and she\u2019s listening to songs and read romances every day while thinking of you\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIn other words, she has no idea of what the world is like\u201d, I the lay down on the bed, \u201dWould you two please put the pups back to the basket so they too get some sleep\u201d<br>\r\nArtica Vixen; \u201dThey already are\u201d, she kissed the pup on the head.<br>\r\nSheila Vixen; \u201dYeah\u201d, and they both put them in the basket.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dBut where will we be staying in, once we arrived at your home?\u201d, referring to herself and the Vixens.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI should be placing you in some big manse in the city, but since there\u2019s none available, I\u2019ll have to have you staying in the Maidenvault\u201d, Zandria sighed while Geecku groaned.<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dThe what?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dThe Maidenvault is a long slate roofed keep behind the Royal Chapel in the castle. It is called this because Allan I Pendragon, known as \u201dthe Blessed\u201d and one of Arthur\u2019s ancestors, confined his three young sisters therein\u201d<br>\r\nThe Vixens; \u201dWhy would he do that?!\u201d, they seem to like speak unison sometimes.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe was a very pious king. So pious that he never married and the year after he was crowned, he took vows of priesthood!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dAnd he built the Maidenvault and locked in his sisters there to avoid them tempting him with carnal thoughts. Of all the sins in the Faith, it was incest that he feared the most\u201d<br>\r\nSheila Vixen; \u201dThe lions in Narnia have no problem with it\u201d<br>\r\nArtica Vixen; \u201dNeither does cows and bunnies\u201d<br>\r\nAkita; \u201dEven dragon-kin often practice incest\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWelcome to Middle-earth. Anyway, we should get some sleep, we still have a long way to Camelot\u201d, suddenly, Geecku gets on top of me.<br>\r\nGeecku; \u201dNo sleep yet. King still owe Geecku for the nights that passed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh\u2026\u201d, was all I said before Geecku leans forward and forces her extremely long tongue inside my mouth. In response, I rolled her over to her back and took off my sleep-shirt before I kissed her again and gropes her massive tits.<br>\r\nAs for Zandria, she began to make out with Akita and they quickly starts pleasuring each other. Sheila and Artica starts pleasuring each other while waiting impatiently for me to be \u201davailable\u201d (Akita was the only one of the three I let to mate with me in only one night, last night, in the whole trip from Wood\u2019s Mark).<br>\r\nI stopped kissing Geecku in order to take my sleep-pants off. I started kissing from her neck to between her massive breasts, down to her belly, all the way to her pussy and started licking it. She holds my head as I keep licking her folds until she came. I then moved to position myself so I have my cock above her folds, and thrusts inside making us both moan in pleasure.<br>\r\nI hold her thighs and move my hips with speed while Geecku massages her own tits and licks her own nipples. She looks at me with her yellow eyes filled with hunger for mating, and me. Finally, after several minutes, I came inside her long and hard, and she pulls me in for a kiss as she comes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I pulled out of her, she quickly gets off the bed to help Zandria out with Akita. And then the Vixens got on the bed and they both kiss me at the same time.<br>\r\nThey then lay me down on the bed. I gazed up at the roof before looking down at my cock. Four huge tits of two vixens engulfed it. It practically disappeared when those tits mashed together! Then Artica pulled away to allow her sister to have some fun with it while she licked and kissed it over and over and over again. Then the two switched. She was a little nervous when Sheila began to unashamedly lick at her nipples along with at my cock shaft. But she quickly got over it.<br>\r\nI groaned and my cock began to spasm, indicating that I was gonna explode soon.<br>\r\nSheila gently pulled us apart. She wasn\u2019t about to let me waste any of my precious seed. To her, it all needed to go into her and her sister\u2019s pussy.<br>\r\nShe placed herself over my face and gently sat herself down. I groaned and instinctively wrapped my arms around Sheila\u2019s thighs. Artica took her sister\u2019s lead and gently lowered herself onto my cock. She gasped and began to hump against me as I began to thrust into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us continued our copulation. Yowling our pleasure to the roof. Completely unaware of what was surrounding us. Only aware of each other.<br>\r\nSheila stiffened as she felt her next orgasm come and break and her juice flood my mouth. It\u2019s a bit addictive as breastmilk from Geecku. She flung her head backwards and howled. Artica rested her hands on her sister\u2019s shoulders for support and flung her own head back before screaming in joy and pleasure as I came in her.<br>\r\nWhen I finished, she fell backwards to the bed and when Sheila lift herself from my head I see Zandria get close to my cock and suck on it, in order to make myself hard again, I guess. Once she finished, she signaled the red vixen above, who then positions above my crotch and impaled onto it. She moves her hips with incredible speed and she bounces up and down, up and down with her tits bounce in every movement.<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019re your women now King Arthur!\u201d, she shouted to me with joy, \u201dMind, body and soul! Our tits, our asses, our pussies, our mouths, everything about us are yours to use!\u201d. I groaned and moaned and knew that I have given up resisting my urges.<br>\r\nAnd then we came together again. Sheila then leans forward and kisses me again, with her tongue dancing with mine and her tits pressing on my chest. When it was over, I look at her eyes, filled with pleasure and commitment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis night will be hard to sleep in...</span></div></div>",

And I saw the warriors again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog-headed warrior, Mors Westford.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck with the flaming sword.<br>\r\nThe red and white knight Balian of Ibelin, Godfrey\u2019s son with the sword of Ibelin.<br>\r\nThe tall knight, Sir Duncan.<br>\r\nLegolas, the Elf.<br>\r\nGimli, the Dwarf.<br>\r\nThomas Marshall, the Templar.<br>\r\nDuke Endrew Frost of the North, riding on Ygritte the Griffon.<br>\r\nThe archer.<br>\r\nThe woman knight.<br>\r\nThe viking.<br>\r\nLastly, the Samurai.<br>\r\nStrangely though, I see other warriors this time: one warrior has a blue-eyed bull\u2019s head and wield a warhammer, and three with heads of lions, each surrounded by seven stars and dressed in white, and finally, an amazon warrior!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dream ended, I opened my eyes and see Geecku, Zandria, Akita, and the Vixens, Sheila and Artica laying spread out the room with smiles on their faces (I was, of course, between the fox-sisters). We\u2019ve been doing it for hours this night, and now the sun is slowly rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the halls with sleepy eyes before I entered the meeting hall to get some breakfast so we all can get to Camelot. I went to the table were Herbert sat along with John, Adrian and Bryan Connor. I sat down and pour a cup of tea while ordering my breakfast (which included eggs and bacon).<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dRough night, Arthur?\u201d, he\u2019s teasing, I know it.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dShut up\u201d, I sip my tea.<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dThe Maidenvault, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d, great, now my former regent\u2019s teasing me!<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs it too much to ask for a nice and quiet while eating breakfast?\u201d, I sip from my teacup again, \u201dAnd I\u2019m sure Duke Blackadder will kill me WHEN he\u2019s figuring it out\u201d<br>\r\nNow Herbert gets serious, \u201dAre your sure you want to do this?\u201d.<br>\r\nI pause for a few seconds and sigh, \u201dIt\u2019s not what I want\u2026 it\u2019s what honor and duty demands\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dAnd what do they demand, Arthur?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHave a queen, further the family line, and get as many armies and fleets to defend Albion from those who would harm us\u2026 And those who would betray us\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dYour father and Godfrey would\u2019ve been proud hearing that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my breakfast arrives, I started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, \u201dWhen was the last time you shaved?\u201d, asked Bryan, my trusted squire. And he\u2019s right, I\u2019ve got more beard than stub now.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dRiverspring I guess? And when we left Wood\u2019s Mark, I decided to just have a beard\u2026 only short and trimmed\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dJust like your father\u201d, he chuckled.<br>\r\nAnd then Sheila showed up holding Balto in her arms against her breasts. She leaned forward to hand over my pup and give me a long kiss on the lips while I just stare at her. I watch her walk away and then look at Balto, who looks well fed. The others at the table smiles teasingly, \u201dShut up\u201d, I muttered before continuing eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater this morning, our journey back to Camelot begins.<br>\r\nDuring the journey it was difficult to stay away from \u201dlovers\u201d. Other than that, it was uneventful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, six days since we left Riverspring, I see it: Camelot. The capital city of Albion. The center of the realm. Home of fifty thousand people.<br>\r\nI can see the walls surrounding the city, the great cathedral and the great castle which is my home.<br>\r\nWhen we reach the western gatehouse, a captain informs us that some visitors from Narnia have arrived earlier today and are waiting in the main courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we went through the gates, with me,  and Balian of Ibelin, I notice a group of men-at-arms sitting by tables outside a tavern down the street. The have the uniforms of House Ibelin.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dLooks like your father have sent word about your arrival\u201d, I nodded towards the men.<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dMy father\u2019s men?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNow they\u2019re yours\u201d, the Ibelin-men noticed us at that moment, \u201dThe big bald one there is Almaric, one of Godfrey\u2019s best men\u201d, we then halted the party and Almaric approaches Balian\u2019s horse and looks up at him.<br>\r\nAlmaric; \u201dYou must have known him\u201d<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nAlmaric; \u201dSince you carry Godfrey\u2019s sword and wear his tabard, you must have known him\u201d<br>\r\nBalian of Ibelin; \u201dYes\u201d<br>\r\nAlmaric; \u201dA man my size?\u201d<br>\r\nBalian gets off his Bretonnian Warhorse, and it shows that Almaric is taller than him, which makes me chuckled a little, \u201dYes\u201d.<br>\r\nAlmaric; \u201dAnd green eyes?\u201d<br>\r\nBalian hesitates for a moment before he realize what is going on, \u201dBlue\u201d, which is true as Godfrey had blue eyes.<br>\r\nAlmaric; \u201dCome with us\u2026 my lord\u201d, he and the rest of the men bow to Balian.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI will have court in a week. You will be legitimized by then. I\u2019ll see you then\u201d, Balian nod and gets escorted to his new manse by his new men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continue to ride through the streets until we reached the castle. As we all enter the courtyard I notice a small group of three Furries, no doubt the visitors the captain of the gate told us about. I need to go to sleep, but I still have to welcome the new guests.<br>\r\nAs me and the Council approaches them I notice all of them are females: one is a black panthress (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/scratchpad/images/f/f7/Panthy_Eltonpot.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140706171922\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/scra...</a>) who has black and blue hair tied in a beehive-shape on top of her head and a gold collar on her neck. Her eyes are dark green. She has thin waist but large breasts, thick thighs and her nipples and pussy (no pun intended) are barely covered with two piece bikini.<br>\r\nOn both her flanks I see two lionesses:<br>\r\nThe one on her right have blue eyes and is a bit smaller than the panthress in height, but still have big breasts (with chest tuft on top) and very wide hips. She\u2019s wearing a sleeveless, special made dress similar to Zandria\u2019s..<br>\r\nThe other lioness on the left of the panthress is taller with much bigger breasts (almost as large as the panthress\u2019), green eyes and a beauty mark on her left cheek. She\u2019s wearing nothing and her hair, chest tuft and tail tuft are black. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static1.e621.net/data/f6/c2/f6c24b06991667c7250ea87a51627341.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static1.e621.net/data/f6/c2/f6c2...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria acts as our translator, \u201d(Welcome to Albion, I hope you had a safe journey)?\u201d, she speaks perfectly in Narnian tongue.<br>\r\nThe panthress speaks in common tongue, \u201dAs safe yours was many years ago. You and Geecku are still seen as legends in Narnia and I can see that the years have not affected you yet\u201d, \u201dCertainly not\u201d, Zandria replied, \u201dAnd who do we have the honor of meeting?\u201d, she asks, \u201dWe are servants of our goddess from kingdoms and queendoms of Narnia. I am Panthy, singer, dancer and priestess from Naath\u201d, she indicates the lioness on her left, \u201dThis one is Bruma, princess of the Queendom of Heidi and seductress of the lions\u201d, and then she indicates to the lioness on her right, \u201dAnd this is Kairel, diplomat and natural daughter of Queen Rihanna of Dolandis\u201d.<br>\r\nZandria then got curious, \u201dEdward, the king before Arthur here, mated with her before leaving Narnia twenty years ago\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dThat\u2019s true, and she used to tell me and my sisters about their night together\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dAnd with your blue eyes and natural meaning born out of marriage, it would seem that\u2026\u201d, Kairel seem to begin to blush.<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dYes. Edward the Seafarer was my father\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou\u2019re my half sister?\u201d, I\u2019ve never met one before and yet there are so many of them!<br>\r\nKairel seem to be nervous, \u201dYeah, heh. Bastard on human term, as a matter of fact\u201d<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dYou seem well educated in our laws?\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dA story for another time. All I can say is that is that I was taught in diplomacy, manners and languages: Albion tongue, High Bretonnian, Estalian, even Imperial tongue\u201d, Imperial tongue is the main language in the Empire of Sigmar.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dStill, it\u2019s good to meet a relative\u201d, Kairel bowed her head in response.<br>\r\nBruma; \u201dIf I may be so bold, you\u2019re not exactly what I expected\u201d, she\u2019s giving me a sultry look, no doubt wanting to fuck me here and now.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow so?\u201d<br>\r\nBruma; \u201dWell, I thought you\u2019d be more of a boy than a king\u201d, she gets closer, \u201dBut now I see that you\u2019re both tall\u2026\u201d, she presses her breasts on my chest, \u201d\u2026and dashing\u201d, she licks her lips. Now I see why she\u2019s called \u201dseductress of the lions\u201d, and she\u2019s naked after all.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThank you for the compliment, Princess\u201d<br>\r\nBruma; \u201dPlease\u2026\u201d, she leans her head forward, \u201d\u2026simply call me Bruma\u201d<br>\r\nLord Herbert then gets between us (thankfully for me), \u201dEven if His Majesty here would like share your culture, he has been traveling all day and needs rest tonight\u201d, she just pouts, as a spoiled princess would.<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dThe lord is right, we need to be respectful of the king\u2019s wishes as we are his guests\u201d, Bruma just looks at her and was about say something when she smells something.<br>\r\nShe walks around me and the Council and sees Geecku, Akita and the Vixens, \u201dIs that a dragon-kin?!\u201d, she then darts to them with excitement.<br>\r\nPanthy; \u201dMany Narnians have never seen a dragon-kin before. Anyway, is there a manse in the city we get to stay in?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dNo, but there are rooms available in the Maidenvault. Follow me please\u201d<br>\r\nWell that got some burden off my shoulder, for the moment. As the group of Furries go to the Maidenvault, I hear Artica Vixen ask Panthy, \u201dWhere in Narnia are you from? I can\u2019t place the accent\u201d, \u201dWhy I\u2019m from the island of Naath\u201d, Panthy replied, and Sheila gleefully said, \u201dOhh! I hear it\u2019s beautiful there, palm trees and butterflies!\u201d.<br>\r\nI whisper to Lady Selena, \u201dI thought Naath have only prey Furries?\u201d<br>\r\nLady Selena; \u201dThey did, until thirty years ago anyway\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat am I gonna do with so many females, including those who will no doubt fuck me to death?!\u201d<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dLet us handle it, Your Majesty. Just get yourself some rest, you've earned it\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Camelot Castle was built by my forefather, the first King Arthur, with help from Merlin, sorcerer and King Arthur\u2019s most trusted advisor and friend.<br>\r\nThe castle is located on Excalibur\u2019s High Hill and is made of pale grey stone. It has seven massive drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts. Massive curtain walls surround the keep, with nests and crenelations for archers. Thick stone parapets, some four feet high, protect the outer edge of the wall ramparts, where the heads of traitors are traditionally placed on iron spikes between the crenels at the gatehouse. The walls have great iron gates and portcullises, with narrow postern doors nearby. The immense barbican has a cobbled square in front of it. Behind the walls are small inner yards, vaulted halls, covered bridges, barracks of the household guards, dungeons, granaries and hot springs.<br>\r\nThe godswood is an acre of of elm, alder and black cottonwood trees that overlook the Bay of Kings. The heart tree, a tree with carved face of the old gods, is a great oak, whose limbs have become overgrown with smoke berry vines. The godswood is also a large part of the Camelot gardens.<br>\r\nInside, the keep holds the seat of the monarch in the throne room, and has several gathering halls, including the Queen\u2019s Ballroom. Doors are made of oak banded with black iron.<br>\r\nThe royal chapel inside Camelot has crystal windows placed high in the walls. It is located in front of the Maidenvault.<br>\r\nThe throne room itself is cavernous, and can sit 1,000 people. It is oriented north to south, with high, narrow windows on the eastern and western walls.<br>\r\nThe Stone, from which Excalibur was pulled out, is located on the main courtyard.<br>\r\nDragon\u2019s Holdfast is a massive square fortress inside the heart of Camelot. Named after the sigil of my house, it is a castle-within-a-castle and is the strongest place in Camelot. The holdfast lies behind walls twelve feet thick. A dry moat lined with a bed of formidable iron spikes surrounds it, with a drawbridge spanning the moat. The only way in or out of Dragon\u2019s is across the drawbridge. Two household guards are always posted at its far end. The royal apartments are located in Dragon\u2019s Holdfast. That\u2019s where I live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering about the rest of the party? Sir Duncan the Tall, his squire Egg and his direwolf pup Shaggydog joined in the small but growing field of tents and pavilions belonging to knights and nobles, from Albion and realms around it, arriving early for the tourney. So does Mors Westford. Alester Sarwyck is in his house\u2019s manse in the city waiting for the rest of his family to arrive. The Connor-brothers (Sir John, Sir Adrian and Bryan), Thomas Marshall, Legolas and Gimli are of course still my bodyguards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter the royal bedchamber, and is relieved to see that no one else is there. A basket was already being prepared for Balto, my own direwolf pup, next to the bed. I gently put him in the basket while he look at me with his blue eyes. That\u2019s when I figured that me and all members of House Pendragon have blue eyes. Fascinating. Another fascinating fact is that his fur is black and white (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/c1/27/09c12724e9169013bd19acc9822be215.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/c1/27/...</a>). The only question is: where will he sleep when he\u2019s fully grown? As for his sister, the last unnamed pup, she\u2019s being carried by Earl Tavington to be delivered to my queen-to-be as a wedding gift.<br>\r\nI changed and then laid down on the bed to finally sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came, and I was awaken by Dioda, the Southland servant girl, who brought my breakfast. When Sarah turn up, after I finishing breakfast, I order her to look after and feed Balto while I take a bath in the hot springs beneath Camelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamelot was not build just around the stone from where I pulled Excalibur, but also on some hot springs which took a bit of work King Arthur I to arrange. The foundations of the castle was magically fortified by Merlin. I walk in to find the cavernous room empty and strip off my clothes and slip in.<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Zandria show up.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dGood morning, Your Majesty. And no, no mating this time\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow are the guests in the Maidenvault doing?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWell, the Vixens got comfortable in their rooms, Kairel got interested in the books that was in the common room and Bruma was curious if Akita\u2019s breasts soft even with scales\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd Geecku went back to the gardens as usual\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dCorrect\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs there any chance of avoiding Bruma?\u201d, I already knew the answer to that.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dNo. And I believe she intends to be your mistress and bear your natural born cubs\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dOr bastards in Albion term\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dCorrect again, Your Majesty\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dPeople will think I\u2019m Arthur the Lusty reborn\u201d, I groaned.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI very much doubt it, Arthur. Anyway, I must get back to my duties\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dVery well\u201d, and she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I relaxed, I forget the time I was in the hot spring. Until I sense someone enter down the stairs. When I hear someone step in the hot spring, I opened my eyes, turn my head and see Bruma approaching me.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThere are other empty springs down here\u201d<br>\r\nBruma; \u201dThis one\u2019s just fine, Your Majesty\u201d, now she\u2019s in front of me, \u201dJust fine\u201d, and she straddle me on my lap, grinding my cock against her pussy.<br>\r\nBy instinct I reach up and grab her large tits and fondle with them, \u201dOoh touch them, my king\u201d, she coos, \u201dfeel how full they are\u201d, she place her own hands on my chest and explores my front. \u201dAnd It\u2019s not the only thing that is full\u201d, she says as my cock grows. I then feel one hand grab the shaft, massaging it, and another cup my balls.<br>\r\nThen she move up to position herself, my cock pointing upwards, and she impale herself on it. Bruma has her hands holding on my shoulders while she moves her hips and my hands holding onto her waist.<br>\r\nShe pull me in and press my face between her breasts, while she whispers, \u201dI'm here to serve your every need, my king. I want to be your lover, I want to be fucked by you and have <i>your</i> cubs, as many as you want. I want them all to be girls and grow into sexy females, so I can watch them<i> play</i> with you\u201d, her implying me mating with potential daughters is turning me on for some reason!<br>\r\nI grab her ass, lift her up, turn around and then lay her on her back on the floor as I pound the pussy\u2019s pussy! I then lift her right leg onto my shoulder and keep fucking her. After what seemed like minutes, I feel I\u2019m getting close. I try to pull out but Bruma won\u2019t let me, her legs have a firm grip.<br>\r\nAnd then we came\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruma seem to be in a pure bliss and purrs while rubbing her belly as it\u2019s filled with seed. \u201dI am officially cursed\u201d, I thought, before she pulls me in for a kiss, which I returned with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating lunch at midday I went to the library to find something to read and relax. There I find Kairel reading a book on a table. She notices me and say, \u201dGood day, Your Majesty\u201d.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dPlease, call me Arthur. We\u2019re siblings after all\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dOk, Arthur\u201d, she blushes.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI bet Bruma\u2019s bragging in the Maidenvault?\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dDon\u2019t get me started\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou don\u2019t get along with her do you?\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dNope. She calls me fat, and I think she\u2019s a slut who rather have natural born children with a human king than with Furry men\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dShe\u2019s called \u201dseductress of lions\u201d though\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dYou could say it\u2019s an honorary title amongst lionesses in her queendom. And she\u2019s got it for a reason\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI see\u2026 What are you reading by the way?\u201d, she shows me, \u201dAh, \u201dThe Legend of Ironrath\u201d, one of my favorites\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dA nun from Albion came to Dolandis when I was little, trying to force my people to abandon our \u201dheathen ways\u201d. My mother's mate, the King of Dolandis, locked her in a cell for a few days, but I was always fascinated by your kind and I wanted her to be my teacher. She taught in history, geography, languages and mathematics. During all this time I have no time for mating\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThen that means\u2026\u201d, I chuckle.<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dYes, I\u2019m a virgin. And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not interested in performing incest with you\u201d, we both giggle.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBruma has a different idea however\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dIndeed\u201d, she sighs, \"And just like regular animals, we Furries have different periods of pregnancies for each kind. For example: Lions get pregnant for 4 months, and three months red and arctic vixens\", which means I will be a father before my future heir is born, great, \u201dAnyway, what are you reading?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe Dance of Dragons\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dA poetic name of a civil war between George I and his older half sister, Elisabeth, in the years 350 to 354. It was one of the bloodiest conflicts on this island\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dSounds terrible\u201d, she had stood, walk around the table and looked over my shoulder, \u201dWhat\u2019s this coat of arms?\u201d, she pointed at the page.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThere have been great knights and worst knights in history, but there have also been those who were both. This one belonged to Sir Criston\u2026 <i>the Kingmaker</i>\u201d<br>\r\nKairel; \u201dThe Kingmaker?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dEdward II wanted Elisabeth, his surviving child from his first marriage, to be his heir. But there were many who preferred George, his eldest son of his second marriage, to be the next king. And while Edward\u2019s corpse was still warm, Sir Criston, the king\u2019s sworn sword, burned his will and named George I King of Albion. And so began <i>the Dance of Dragons</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYour Majesty?\u201d, I turned to see John and Adrian accompanied by one of Earl Edwin\u2019s servants.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\nJohn Connor; \u201dThe Council is requesting your presence\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dThe Bishop is here, and he doesn\u2019t look good\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s also very obese and his robe, rings on his fingers and necklaces are decorated with gold and jewelry.<br>\r\nToday, however, he looks like he\u2019s been attacked as it it clear that his face is heavily bruised. \u201dWhat happened?\u201d, I said as I sat down on the throne. The Council are at their seats and my bodyguards stands next to the throne.<br>\r\nBishop Heraclitus; \u201dLike the High priest, I the Bishop give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world, second to the High priest. An insult to us is insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou were assaulted?\u201d, although I don\u2019t agree that the Bishop is the same as the High priest.<br>\r\nBishop Heraclitus; \u201dI was, by those fanatics who call themselves \u201dsparrows\u201d. They humiliated me, they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestone.

And they gave their leader the blasphemous name High Sparrow!\u201d, High Sparrow?<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI heard this all began in a brothel\u201d, all of us look at her. I look back at the Bishop, whose face is turning red.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs that so?\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dBishop, this is a rather shocking thing to hear\u201d<br>\r\nBishop Heraclitus; \u201dI tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Gods\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSo you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?\u201d<br>\r\nBishop Heraclitus; \u201dA man\u2019s private affairs ought to stay private, whore!\u201d, I barely controlled myself upon hearing that.<br>\r\nLady Violet; \u201dThat may be true. But not when it comes to the high ranks of the faith. You are suppose to be an example of our Faith, Bishop\u201d, the Bishop glares at her.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat do you want from us, Bishop?\u201d<br>\r\nBishop Heraclitus; \u201dJustice!\u201d, he shouted, \u201dI ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the dungeons. I ask that execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He\u2019s a threat to everything we hold sacred! If he goes unpunished-\u201d, I held up my hand, shutting him up.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the royal stables with Sir Adrian Connor and Sir Thomas Marshall to ready our horses. We\u2019re all dressed in chainmail armour.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSir Thomas? Had the Bishop Absolved your Templar vows before all that happened?\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dYes, Your Majesty. Early this morning, and he gave me this simple necklace as proof\u201d, he indicated to the necklace around his neck: a chain holding a red cross in a circle.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dWhat now? Find a woman? Get married? Have children?\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dProtect the king with my life. The rest no longer interest me\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dYeah, marriage doesn\u2019t interest either. I\u2019m fine with guarding my friend, the king\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAlthough I heard that you slept with a prostitute last year?\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dIt was my 16th birthday! John had been saving a lot of money for my sake, but he should have gotten a prostitute of his own. Older brother, but still a fucking virgin. At least I won\u2019t die a virgin!\u201d, we both chuckle.<br>\r\nMe; \"So if I told you to celibate, would you leave?\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dHell no! I\u2019ll guard you with my life, no matter what!\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dWhy ask such a question, Your Majesty?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dCome closer, you two\u201d, and they did, \u201dIt has, in history, been proven that both knights and regular soldiers aren\u2019t always the best guards\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dTrue enough\u201d, and Sir Thomas nod in agreement.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dTherefore, I will establish a group of seven elite bodyguards, warriors no matter faith or gender, sworn to protect their king and the royal family with their own live, to obey his commands, and to keep his secrets, sworn for life and are forbidden from owning land, taking a wive, or fathering children. They will be known as the Kingsguard\u201d<br>\r\nBoth knights then bend their knee before me.<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dThen let me be the first of your Kingsguard\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dAnd me too, as we both have white swords\u201d<br>\r\nI smile and say, \u201dThe two of you held me up while fighting ranks of dragon-kin. I couldn\u2019t ask for better Kingsguard, now rise\u201d, they stand up, and I put my hand on Sir Thomas\u2019 shoulder and proclaim, \u201dAs you have more experience than most, I name you Commander of the Kingsguard. Now saddle up. It\u2019s time to meet this High Sparrow\u201d.<br>\r\nI get up on Miramis, my piebald Bretonnian Warhorse, before Adrian said, \u201dIf there\u2019s a Kingsguard\u201d, he sits on his saddle, \u201dshouldn\u2019t there be a Queensguard?\u201d, \u201dMaybe, I need my queen's opinion first\u201d, I reply before riding to the gates, \u201dOhh\u201d, says Adrian and Marshall chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrive by old stairs made of stone. There some people at the bottom. I told Adrian to watch the horses and went to a young man and asked, \u201dExcuse me, but where can I find the High Sparrow?\u201d. The man points up the stairs. They are crowded with people. Sir Thomas and I ascend them.<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs is a large room where many people eat at the tables: men, woman, children and old people.<br>\r\nMan 1; \u201dBless you\u201d<br>\r\nMan 2; \u201dThank you\u201d<br>\r\nMan 3; \u201dJust a little more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nWoman; \u201dThank you ever so for the soup!\u201d<br>\r\nThey ware talking to an old man giving soup to people in line in the center of the room. I approach him, \u201dA young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?\u201d, \u201dHigh Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle\u201d, he laugh, \u201dWe\u2019re often stuck with the names our enemies give to us\u201d, prepares soup for the next person in line, \u201dThe notion that we are all equal in the eyes of the Gods doesn\u2019t sit well with some, so they belittle me\u201d<br>\r\nWoman 2; \u201dBlessings to you\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dBlessing to you, my dear\u201d, turns back to me, \u201dIt\u2019s only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers\u201d, and then prepares soup to the next person in line.<br>\r\nI then notice his feet: he wears no shoe and his feet look black, gnarled and hard as tree roots. Seems to me that he had walked barefoot for a long time.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy no shoes?\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dBecause I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are\u201d, when the last person receives the soup he starts giving out pieces of bread.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs that why you came to Camelot? To remind everyone?\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dEveryone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one\u2019s special. And they think I\u2019m special for telling them so\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dPerhaps they\u2019re right\u201d, I said smiling.<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dIt would be comforting to believe that, wouldn\u2019t it? The Gods sent you to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you\u2019d only come here to arrest me.

And then an old beggar turn up, \u201dHello, m\u2019lords! Oh, would you be Alester Sarwyck? Say, have you got anything for Old Ren? Just a coin for a wounded veteran?\u201d, he obviously don\u2019t know who I am.

With all due respect, you\u2019ve gotten a few wrinkles, but you\u2019ve not changed much\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWould you also know my brother? He\u2019s been spending a lot of time here in the past few years\u201d<br>\r\nOld Ren; \u201dNo, my lord. I\u2019ve never seen him in the flesh. It\u2019s his people that we know. Especially Hubb, the groom. He comes to the taverns to throw back a few pints. And then, he talks. He told us that Lord Gawen will return here, with his whole family, and Earl Sarwyck is dead. There are rumors about him though\u201d, rumors we\u2019re aware of, \u201dThere\u2019s no way to be sure, because Hubb has not shown his face in a while since he was assaulted by some men. You would almost think the man lost his thirst for ale\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dI know enough\u2026\u201d, he gave Old Ren a silver coin, \u201dHere, for your troubles.

Since we have white swords, shouldn\u2019t we have white uniforms?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhite armour, white cloaks\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dIn other words, we shall always be dressed in white\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSomething like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAnd then we hear someone screaming inside a tailor shop. We went inside, only to see who I assume is the owner of the shop being in despair for something. \u201dHow could they?!\u201d, he shouted, \u201dHow could they just cancel an order for 1 Gold Crown like that?\u201d, oh, typical, \u201dWhat will I do with these seven white cloaks?!\u201d, and he starts crying for the loss of money.<br>\r\nWait. White cloaks? Just what we need. After getting something from the satchel I went straight for the owner. \u201dWe\u2019ll take them\u201d, I said, \u201dWhat?\u201d, he asked. I dropped a gold coin at his feet. He immediately promised he would deliver as soon as possible.<br>\r\nWe went back to our horses, with Adrian and Thomas wearing their new cloaks on their shoulders.<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dLooks good\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dSure does. But it would look better if we\u2019re wearing white armour\u201d<br>\r\nMan; \u201dIf you\u2019re looking for the best armour, Master Tommard is your man\u201d, I look down at two merchants near us.<br>\r\nMan 2; \u201dForget it. He\u2019s too expensive!\u201d<br>\r\nMan 1; \u201dThat\u2019s because he\u2019s the best!\u201d<br>\r\nMan 2; \u201dC\u2019mon! Be seri-\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhere can I find this Master Tommard?\u201d, they shut up right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreet of Steel. Fancy name for a whole street of forges. From what I\u2019ve been told, Master Tommard set up shop five years ago. We are now outside his house at the right end of the street, and it\u2019s a big one: made of timber and plaster and larger than all other buildings on the street. Its upper stories tower over the street, Tommard seems to live above his shop. The double doors have an ebony and albino redwood (from Narnia, perhaps) carving of a hunting scene. Two stone knights armored in red suits of armor in the shapes of a griffon and a unicorn guard the entrance.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dHuh, interesting\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dThis Master Tommard must be a very wealthy merchant\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWe\u2019ll see about that\u201d, a knight walks out, trying to be fancy about.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dKnights. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who\u2019ve never seen an arrow coming their way\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dThe knights of Bretonnia are no better\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWait here by the entrance\u201d<br>\r\nI went inside and encounter a slim serving girl and told her to get Tommard and tell him that the king is here. He came down very quickly. He owns a black velvet coat which has silver hammers embroidered on the sleeves. A large sapphire hangs on a heavy silver chain about his neck. He looks to be over fifty.<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dHis Majesty honors me with his presence!\u201d, his accent seem familiar, but not from Albion, \u201dGirl, fetch some wine for the king!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNo need. I\u2019m just here to settle my curiosity\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dAh! Fair enough. My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, Your Majesty. You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the realm, I promise you. Visit every forge in Camelot if you like, and compare for yourself. Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail; my work is art\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIs that so? Where did you learn to smith? Dwarfs?\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dOf course! A dwarf smith living in Altdorf as a matter of fact\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe imperial capital?\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dAs you may notice the accent, I\u2019m born in the heart of Reikland. And true, it is rare for a dwarf to teach a human in the arts of smithing. Also, thanks to him, I\u2019m the only armorer who can add tint to the metals in a suit of armor without using paint. The dragon is the sigil of House Pendragon, if I remember correctly? I could fashion a dragon helm so real that children will will run from you in the street\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe day I scare children is the day I\u2019m in hell. I\u2019m here because I would like to order seven full body armors and helms before the end of the month\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dCertainly! What appearances would you like for them to have?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSeven will be completely in white, and the breastplates will have a small white shield with a golden crown. Other than that, no decoration unless the owners want it\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dI will work on them immediately. I\u2019ll even have two of the white armors ready and delivered in a few days. Is it possible to size up their owners?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dOf course\u201d<br>\r\nWe went outside, and all he needed was to look at them, and he was satisfied. We went inside again.<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dI can already see them in white. And no need to worry about the price yet. And I\u2019m thankful that someone from the castle comes to patronize my work\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dWell, since you\u2019re obviously unaware. The Marshal and the Steward visited here once, in the spring. I offered the Marshal a wolf\u2019s head helmet, but they just came to see the boy\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat boy?\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dOne of my most talented apprentices, Gendry\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThen, I\u2019d like to see him as well\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dAs you wish, Your Majesty. If you would follow me please\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ever since I was a little boy I always wanted a sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, when we entered a shadowy street, Miramis, my warhorse, kneed and stopped abruptly. In front of us stood a hooded man with a skull and a scythe on his shirt in the middle of the road. Alester Sarwyck rode up next to me and told the man, \u201dMove aside for\u2026\u201d, but before he say more, a familiar figure came out of an alley.

A damn kinslayer!\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dI still fail to understand the alleged reward for my brother and me\u2026 No one has put a bounty on my head, as far as I know\u201d<br>\r\nAxe; \u201dPerhaps, but you must know where he is\u2026 If you don\u2019t want to tell us, we\u2019ll spread the word that we beat you and your friends to a pulp, so your brother will show his face. And then, we\u2019ll have him\u201d, I then began to laugh, getting his attention, \u201dWhat the hell are you laughing at, boy?!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThat all of you are so stupid!\u201d, I turn my eyes to the old man, \u201dDo you not notice a king when you see the sword?!\u201d<br>\r\nI pull Excalibur from the sheath for the two men to see. The old man got scared and nearly pissed himself, while Axe muttered, \u201dShit\u201d.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd have you two never heard of people best left alone? My friends here are such people!\u201d<br>\r\nAxe; \u201dNo matter. No one will hear from dead men\u201d, damn, overconfidence, not good, \u201dOnce I\u2019ve broken all your teeth, you\u2019ll beg me to release you to your-\u201d, and he suddenly notices something around us.<br>\r\nAnd then we notice. His men are gone! Where did they go? Axe shouted out, \u201dWhat are you doing?! Get back out here!\u201d. And then all of a sudden we hear another voice, \u201dThey are seeing their own gods right now\u201d.<br>\r\nBehind Axe I see another man: he\u2019s wearing some type of faded white clothing with a cape draped over and around left arm and a beaked hood over his head, covering his eyes. Old Ren fell to his knees holding his hands together to pray.<br>\r\nAxe; \u201dAnd just who the fuck are you?!\u201d<br>\r\nMan; \u201dWho we are do not matter\u201d<br>\r\nAxe; \u201dWe?\u201d<br>\r\nI looked around, and see several people dressed like the man out of the shadows.<br>\r\nMan; \u201dAnd if I were you, I would run away, and fast\u201d, he turn his head to my direction, \u201dSpy Mistress send her regards\u201d, and then runs into an alley and disappears, along with the rest.<br>\r\nNot long afterwards, a group of men from the City Watch appear around the corner. The officer leading them notices Axe and shouts, \u201dHalt! What\u2019s going on here? Disarm yourself immediately, in the name of the king!\u201d. Axe shouted, \u201dShit! Gold Cloaks\u2026\u201d, he turned to us, \u201dWe\u2019ll see you again, lordlings. The Reapers never forget an enemy\u201d, and he bolted into another alley and he\u2019s gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognize the officer as Captain Caron, wearing chainmail beneath a black breastplate ornamented with four golden disks, like any other officer.<br>\r\nCaptain Caron; \u201dYour Majesty, what happened here?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNot entirely sure, but just as I revealed who I was, all but one fled to the shadows\u201d, easier to explain than what really happened. Still hard to believe though.<br>\r\nCaptain Caron; \u201dAlright\u201d, he turn his head to Alester, \u201dI never seen you in the city before, sir. Could you tell me your name?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dMy name is Alester Sarwyck\u201d<br>\r\nCaptain Caron; \u201dNow I understand. You\u2019re the brother of the man accused of killing his father\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dOf which there\u2019s no proof of, only rumors. And who the hell has put a bounty on his head?!\u201d<br>\r\nCaptain Caron; \u201dNo one did, but these rumors certainly has tongues wagging. And since many of the populace are poor and hungry, it could cause you problems. Keep your eyes open\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dThank you for your consideration\u201d<br>\r\nCaptain Caron; \u201dWhatever the case, your attackers bolted like rats. Do any of you have any notion of who they were?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThey claimed to be called the Reapers. Does that mean anything to you?\u201d<br>\r\nCaptain Caron; \u201dA gang of brutes and thieves who crawl through the city sewers. Petty thugs, for the most part\u2026 Their boss must be quite clever, to still be working after all these years. But we\u2019ll get them sooner or later, trust me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the men of the City Watch was away, we got off our horses and went to the weeping Old Ren who was.<br>\r\nMors Westford; \u201dSo, you were their lookout, were you?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNow that they\u2019re gone, you\u2019re all alone\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dAnd you will suffer the consequences of your actions\u201d<br>\r\nOld Ren; \u201dOh, please! Oh, please, my lord! I had no choice!\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dEnough. I will not be swayed by your lies\u201d<br>\r\nOld Ren; \u201dAh, mercy! Believe me that I\u2019m ashamed, my lord! You were so good to me! I beg of you! Take pity of an old man! With my frail hands made useless by my illness, I can no longer work. When I see a chance to earn a little coin, how can I pass it up?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe\u2019s not worth wasting time on, Earl Alester\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dAgreed. Another man would have slit your throat for less, now disappear\u201d<br>\r\nOld Ren; \u201dOh, many thanks, my lord! Many thanks!\u201d, he then ran away down the street.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dWho was that hooded man anyway?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dDon\u2019t know, my friend. But Zandria will have a lot of explaining to do\u201d</span></div></div>",

We took the horses back to stables, and my two Kingsguard knights followed me through the castle to a tower. This tower is a slender structure of four stories built into an angle of the castle wall overlooking the bay. We stopped beneath it.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dThis was a guard tower. Now it\u2019s empty but still getting cleaned\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNow it will contain the chambers of the Kingsguard. And it will be called White Sword Tower\u201d<br>\r\nWe went inside and I lay out how it will look: The circular room in the first floor, with whitewashed stone walls, will be known as the Round Room with the walls hung with white woolen tapestries and there will be a large white table, in the shape of a shield, with seven chairs and provides a meeting space for the order. The undercroft will hold the white arms and armor, the second and third floor hold the small sparse sleeping cells of the six members of the Kingsguard, and the topmost floor is given over to the Commander\u2019s apartments, who currently is Thomas Marshall. His rooms are sparse as well, but spacious, and they stand above the outer walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all that\u2019s been taken cared of, I went for bed, while my Kingsguard stand guard outside the royal bedchamber\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up by the sound of a tiny howling beside the bed. I look down to see Balto still in the basket, and howl. Direwolves do grow fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the hall to the dining hall were my breakfast is ready. I was holding Balto and followed by Kingsguard. There will be five more.<br>\r\nWhen we entered, we see Zandria sitting by the table with\u2026 the hooded man (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/assassinscreed/images/3/3c/ACB-Ezio.png/revision/latest?cb=20140106194438&amp;path-prefix=nl\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/assa...</a>) from yesterday!<br>\r\n\u201dYou?!\u201d, I said, Sir Thomas and Sir Adrian ready to draw their swords.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI see you\u2019ve already met one of my spies\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nMan; \u201dMy apologies joining your breakfast uninvited, Your Majesty\u201d, now I notice that he speaks with a Tilean accent.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWho are you?\u201d, he stands up.<br>\r\nMan; \u201dEzio Auditore. Mentor\u201d, he bows.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dMentor of whom?\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dAssassins\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dNo need to worry, Arthur\u201d, she stands up and guide me to my chair, \u201dThey're assassins, only if necessary\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dWe are mostly spies, steal documents with valuable information and mingle with locals. We hide in plain sight and never harm innocents\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhere did you learn all that exactly?\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dI descent from a member of an assassin order in Araby. This member left to make his own path and he came to Tilea. He found a woman and started a family. His values, the Creed, and his skills passed down from father to son, generation after generation\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe Creed?\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201d1. Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent. 2. Hide in plain sight, be one with the crowd. And 3. Never compromise the brotherhood. The values are defending those who cannot defend themselves and try help leaders to do good. When my training was complete, I knew these values had no place in Tilea, so I left and arrived here, twenty years ago. Zandria here wanted my help to form an organization of spies that could work undetected. If there was a good place to form a brotherhood, it would be here\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou can spy anywhere?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dCamelot has a network of secret passages and tunnels. Merlin had them built to enable the royal family to make a quick escape should enemies ever trap them. The tunnels are full of traps for enemy spies. All tunnels are of stones. Some of them are so small that a grown man must crawl through them. Some pass very close to other rooms in the Keep, allowing a hidden person to eavesdrop on conversations\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dWe can also disguise ourselves: a guard, a beggar, a merchant, even a courtesan\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThat\u2019s a Tilean word for prostitutes\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dCorrect\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dCan I at least see your face?\u201d<br>\r\nEzio look at Zandria, the Spy Mistress, for permission. She nods, and he pulls off the hood to reveal a man with hair and beard in black and grey.<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dAs for killing, we only do that if we\u2019re compromised, detected or attacked by enemies. If you wish it, we will kill a foreign enemy king and end the war before it began. And as you saw yesterday, we kill those who will try to kill you\u201d<br>\r\nI must say I\u2019m impressed.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dNow I\u2019m sure you have a lot of work to do\u201d<br>\r\nEzio Auditore; \u201dCome vuoi, signora (As you wish, Mistress). E buona fortuna a te, too maest\u00e1 (And good fortune for you, Your Majesty)\u201d, and he leaves through a wall that opened and then closed.<br>\r\nI am definitely impressed.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dIf you don\u2019t mind, Arthur, I\u2019d like to discuss a few things with you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly know what that means\u2026</span></div></div>",

The Furry lizard gyrated her hips with the experience of a whore despite the fact that her pussy was incredibly tight.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI wish me and Geecku could be able to have babies with you, as I wished we had your father\u2019s\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI too wish I could have children with the two of you\u201d, and it\u2019s real honesty.<br>\r\nAnd then we share orgasm and she leaned forward to kiss me, before she lay down on me.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dYou\u2019re getting better, Arthur\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThanks\u201d, and I then decided, \u201dWhen were you and the others gonna tell me about Gendry?\u201d<br>\r\nShe rise her head to look at me, a bit surprised.<br>\r\nSuddenly a secret door in a wall opened to reveal one of her hooded spies bringing someone with his eyes blindfolded. I immediately recognize him as Sir Lancel Price, the former redhead squire and one of two nephews of one of my members of the court, Lord John Price. I look at Zandria who put a finger to her lips, signaling me to be quiet. She rose up from the bed and walked to Lancel.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSir Lancel. What brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dWhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dDon\u2019t worry yourself with that, and do please keep the blindfold on\u201d, she leads him to a couple of chairs where they sat down, \u201dNow, what news do you have for me? Is it Lady Tremaine? What\u2019s she planning?\u201d, Lady Tremaine? That\u2019s Lord John\u2019s wife.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dIt\u2019s wildfire\u201d, What?! Wildfire?! I listened carefully of what they talk about.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWildfire?\u201d, he nods in response, \u201dYou wouldn\u2019t lie to me, would you, knight?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dNo\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dThat\u2019s a lie right there\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dIt is NOT a lie. Why would I lie?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dTell me: if your uncle finds out you\u2019re fucking his wife, do you think he will be more likely to kill you, or less likely\u201d, what?<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dI\u2019m telling you the truth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dThe smart money would be on \u2019less likely\u2019\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dShe\u2019s making wildfire, I sw\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSince the fear of being labeled a kinslayer would give him sympathy for yours, or hand you over to the king\u201d, she winks at me.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dThe Alchemists\u2019 Guild is being commissioned\u2026\u201d, those pyromancers?!<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI suppose there\u2019s only one way to find out\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dThey have thousands of pots, already stored in their vaults. They are planning on giving them all to the king, so he can launch them in his enemies. Please!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWhen did she tell you this?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dI heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSwear to me on what?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dOn my life!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dBut why would I care about your life?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dIn the light of the Gods, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Price, do solemnly vow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dAll right, all right, enough. Even torturing you is boring\u201d<br>\r\nWas that torture?<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dJust get out\u201d, the spy leads Sir Lancel back to the tunnel opening when she says, \u201dOh, Lancel, tell Byron to please kill you if anything should happen to me\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dPlease kill me if anything should happen to Lady Zandria\u201d<br>\r\nByron; \u201dDon\u2019t mind if I do\u201d, and the door became a wall again.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dIt\u2019s a funny story, really\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dTell me\u201d, this will be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month earlier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had always thought that I was respected by the members of the court. But it turns out that Lord Price is only one of the few who still respects me, while the rest, including Lord John Price\u2019s wife, Lady Tremaine, thinks that I\u2019m just a boy who rather lay with \u201dEdward\u2019s whores\u201d, Zandria and Geecku, than rule and that they can do whatever they please. They also seem to think that Zandria rather fucks than spying. But that\u2019s where they\u2019re foolishly wrong (after what I saw of her spies). She gathers intelligence on them every day, but she had difficulties on gathering info on Tremaine.<br>\r\nShe\u2019s from a family exiled from Bretonnia, and ever since she followed her husband to my court, she\u2019s being influential on many of the other members of the court. She\u2019s also very ambitious, as she tried several times have me marry her daughter, Sansa, only to fail, and her daughter sees me as one of the shinning knights from the stories and want to be my queen. But she has no idea how the real world works.<br>\r\nLady Tremaine also seems to have a talent of keeping secrets. Zandria tried to find an opportunity against her.<br>\r\nAnd that opportunity present itself when Zandria and the rest of the council arrested Pycelle, an aged monk and Lady Tremaine\u2019s advisor, on the charge of breaking celibacy. And she had suspicions of Tremaine and Lancel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night after Pycelle\u2019s arrest. Zandria was reading through reports from the realm (she would often work through the night when she needs to), when the door knocked. She looked through the peephole on the door and saw Sir Lancel Price. She figured that Tremaine seemed to think that Zandria alone had Pycelle capture, by sending Sir Lancel late in the night would catch her less alert (she certainly has no idea how a Spy Master/Mistress works). Zandria takes her time, puts her robe, and roughens her green hair to make it look like she had been woken from her sleep. She opened the door, to see Lancel had been pacing.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dYour visits are too few, good Sir Lancel\u201d, sounding seductive and sarcastic at the same time. But Lancel was not amused.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dMy Lady Tremaine Price demand you to release Brother Pycelle\u201d, he hands her a parchment, \u201dHere\u2019s your warrant\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSo it is\u201d, she walks back to her work desk with it, \u201dWill you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep\u201d, not exactly true, but he doesn\u2019t know that.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dI am here at my lady\u2019s behest, not to drink with you, whore\u201d, the arrogance of a young knight. He was about to walk away before she continued.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dIf Lady Tremaine was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she\u2019d come herself. Instead she sends you\u201d, she sat down, \u201dWhat am I to make of that?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dI don\u2019t care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dAnd you\u2019ve received these instructions directly from Tremaine?\u201d, she opened the warrant to pretend reading it.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dAs I said several times\u201d, he walks up to her work desk.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dAnd you\u2019ve waited this long to deliver the information?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dWhen my lady gives me a command, I carry it out without delay\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dTremaine must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf\u201d, she looks at him mischievously, making him confused.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dMy lady has a great many responsibilities for her family. She often work from dusk till dawn\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dShe must be very glad to have you helping her\u201d, she stands up, \u201dFrom dusk till dawn\u201d, she walks to the door, but not before sniffing while passing him, \u201dAh. Lavender oil. I heard she always loved lavender oil, even as a girl\u201d, she then closed the door.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dI am a Knight!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dAnd I am a Spy Mistress\u201d, he scoffs at her reply, \u201dTell me, did Lady Tremaine have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed?\u201d, Sir Lancel became dumbstruck, confirming her suspicions, \u201dWhat? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, Sir?\u201d<br>\r\nHe draws his sword and points it at her, \u201dYou will withdraw these filthy accusations!\u201d, and suddenly he\u2019s surrounded by her hooded spies, with daggers drawn, and his courage deserts him.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dHave you ever given any thought to what your uncle will have to say when he finds out you have been bedding his wife?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dDid she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, Knight?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dWhen my uncle, Lord John, knighted me, he told me to obey her in everything!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dDid he tell you to fuck her, too?\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; I only meant, I did as I was bid. I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dHated every moment of it, is that what you\u2019ll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, your lady\u2019s legs spreading open for you at night! Oh yes, it must have been terrible! Wait here, His Majesty will want to hear this\u201d, he then suddenly crawls on the floor on both knees, begging.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dMercy! Mercy, my lady! I beg you!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSave it to King Arthur: he loves a good grovel, I bet\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dMy lady, it was my lady\u2019s bidding, Tremaine. I\u2019ll leave the city at once, I swear\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dNo, I think not\u201d, she giggled at his confused look.<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dMy lady?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dYou heard me\u201d, she approaches the kneeling knight, \u201dYour uncle told you to obey his wife. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me\u201d, she bends forward and puts her hands on her knees, making him uncomfortable in his trousers as he saw her cleavage before looking back at her eyes, \u201dI want to know what Tremaine is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything and you will tell me\u201d<br>\r\nLancel Price; \u201dYes, my lady, I will. I swear it as you command\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria had him share a cup of wine with her and she told him she will have Pycelle freed in the morning, but he will not be seeing another girl again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking be true\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed so hard I couldn\u2019t breath!

He was a commoner, a butcher\u2019s son, who joined the City Watch and rose through the ranks first to captain of a gate house and then to become it\u2019s commander at the death of the former commander. Barely fifty, bald and a beard white as snow, and dressed in City Watch uniform.<br>\r\nWe sat on our chairs in the Council chamber as he talks about problems in the city.<br>\r\nJanos Slynt; \u201dIt\u2019s the King\u2019s tournament that\u2019s causing all this trouble, my lords, Your Majesty\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dIt\u2019s officially a tournament to honor the king and celebrate his wedding\u201d<br>\r\nJanos Slynt; \u201dCall it what you will, my lord, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Elisabeth\u201d<br>\r\nLady Violet; \u201dDreadful\u201d, she gasped.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dIf you can\u2019t keep the peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can\u201d<br>\r\nJanos Slynt; \u201dI need more men\u201d, he glared at Sir Robert.<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dSurely the Royal Army can lend some men to help the Watch?\u201d, he asked Sir Robert.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dHmph. Fine. I\u2019ll have a few hundred patrolling the streets with the Gold Cloaks\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019ll also give you fifty of the castle\u2019s household guards till the crowds have left\u201d<br>\r\nJanos Slynt; \u201dThank you, Your Majesty. They will be put to good use\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBefore you leave, I need to tell you about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nJanos Slynt; \u201dI know, I know, Gawen Sarwyck. But it\u2019s extremely difficult to convince people who are too hungry and too greedy to care\u201d, and he walked out of the chamber.<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dI don\u2019t like him. I have seen his kind before\u201d, I worked really hard convincing him that a Commander of the Kingsguard should sit in the Council of the king.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd it seems like you don\u2019t like him either, Sir Robert?\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dThat man is known to be disgraceful and arrogant, and worse a lickspittle, enjoying talks with members of the court thinking their his friends\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWhile in fact they\u2019re using him\u201d, not surprising after what she told me.<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dIt is rumored that he\u2019s corrupt\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dI must admit that I had Ezio and his men spying at other noble\u2019s castles and cities. We had spent the past twenty years training plenty of spies, so now I think it\u2019s time to focus here in the capital\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI had heard that the Gold Cloaks has have always been corrupt\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dTrue, but we still need to discipline them, as many of them don\u2019t act like soldiers should\u201d<br>\r\nLady Selena; \u201dTwo men were willing to tell us about how corrupt the commander is, but they were found dead shortly afterwards\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThen when can we put spies inside the Watch?\u201d, I turned to Zandria.<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dSoon enough, you have my word, Arthur\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell, the sooner all this, including the tourney, is over, the better\u201d<br>\r\nLady Violet; \u201dThe realm prospers from such events, Your Majesty. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dAnd every inn in the city is full and whores are walking bow-legged\u201d, the last bit tended to be of a joke, and I chuckled to that.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dThat reminds of a story from the reign of King Robert I: a member of the Council proposed outlawing brothels, prompting King Robert, who himself frequent brothels, to ask if he wanted outlawing eating, shitting, and breathing as well\u201d, that made us all laugh.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019m sure the tourney puts coin in many a pocket. Now, Zandria?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dRight. My lords, ladies, I have some interesting news\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the Council chamber. Adrian Connor stand guarding the doors while talking with his brother John, Legolas and Gimli, commenting the uniforms the Wood Elf and the Dwarf wears. Suddenly, they hear someone in the chambers shout, \u201dWILDFIRE?!\u201d. They all got silent for a moment.<br>\r\nLegolas; \u201dWas that Sir Robert?\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dAnd what in blazes is wildfire?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alchemists\u2019 Guild, also referred to as the Guild of Alchemists, is an old order of pyromancers. The guild was once powerful, though in the recent centuries, the pyromancers saw their influence dwindle. The pyromancers still claim to posses vast stores of knowledge.<br>\r\nA full member of the Alchemists\u2019 Guild is called a <i>wisdom</i>. There are also apprentices and acolytes to assist them. The order is led by a wisdom that bears the title of Grand Master.<br>\r\nNow only a few of the order remain.<br>\r\nThe alchemists claimed to be able to transmute metals and create living creatures of flame, at the height of their power. In more recent times, they are still likely to hint at possessing vast secret stores of knowledge, though they only demonstrate the skill to create wildfire, which they call <i>the substance</i>. The wildfire is created in the Guildhall, located on the Street of Elisabeth (Named after George I\u2019s sister and rival for the throne). And that\u2019s were we are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe, the members of the Council, my Kingsguard (Sir Adrian and Sir Thomas) and bodyguards (Sir John, Legolas and Gimli) are in the Guildhall, where the pyromancers reside on the Street of Elisabeth.<br>\r\n\u201dTake care, Your Majesty\u201d, said wisdom Hall, an elderly pyromancer who seems to be over 70 years of age, as I inspect a jar of green liquid. Wildfire.<br>\r\n\u201dI remember reading an old sailor\u2019s proverb\u201d, I said to him, \u201dPiss on wildfire and your cock burns off\u201d.<br>\r\nWisdom Hall; \u201dOh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like butter. Wildfire was the key to Alaric I Pendragon\u2019s power\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAlaric the Mad, yes. His obsession with wildfire was equal to his lust for his Fae-concubines. He had threaten to burn the whole city if anyone tried to attack him. Which was the reason no-one attacked the city, as they would not want to burn. And in the end, his death came at the hand of one of his guards\u201d<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dOur Marshal and one of His Majesty\u2019s guards here takes issue\u201d<br>\r\nGimli; \u201dIf I could tell you how many crazy old men I\u2019ve seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit\u201d, he chuckled a little but stopped when the pyromancer glared and the rest of us looked at him, \u201dNo offense meant\u201d, he raised his hands.<br>\r\nWisdom Hall; \u201dOur order does not deal in pig shit!\u201d, he pointed his finger at Gimli, \u201dThe substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since before Alaric the Mad\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dTo do what?\u201d<br>\r\nWisdom Hall; \u201dThe jars are to be put in catapults and flung at the enemy\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow much do you have?\u201d, I asked as he started to walk, guiding us through the hallways. The Guildhall is an imposing labyrinth of cold, black stone.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dIf you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you\u2019d hit your target one time in ten, but while the Royal Army has true soldiers, the Gold Cloaks are not\u201d<br>\r\nWisdom Hall; \u201dYour Majesty, this man is insulting\u201d, we stopped by a door with many locks that he has keys to.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen a battle, old man, but I have since I was young, and things can get messy. \u2019Cause when we\u2019re flinging things at the enemy, they\u2019re flinging them back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dMy Marshal remains unconvinced\u201d<br>\r\nWisdom Hall; \u201dHe would not dare insult my order whilst Alaric the Mad lived\u201d, he unlocked the last lock.<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dWell, he\u2019s not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn\u2019t help him, did they?\u201d, fortunately the pots were found and destroyed, \u201dMen win wars, not magic trick\u201d<br>\r\nBut as soon as the pyromancer opened the door, we all see to our astonishment a massive room filled with shelves with hundreds of pots.<br>\r\nWisdom Hall; \u201dWe have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since Lady Tremaine gave us your command to do so. Our present count stand at 7,840. Enough to burn fleets and armies both\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dThis is a shit idea\u201d.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019m afraid I have to concur with my Kingsguard, Wisdom Hall. The contents of this room could lay Camelot low. All the way to the Underworld\u201d, I step in front of him, \u201dAnd know this: Lady Tremaine has no authority of any kind, she did not meant to give me all this, so you will stop making wildfire and let these pots remain here and will not leave here under any circumstances, unless I say so. Understood?\u201d, and he understood perfectly.</span></div></div>",

I knew it was your eyes he described, despite that you covered yourself head to toe. Gendry have blue eyes, like me\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dShit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHerbert Turner; \u201dArthur, please understand\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhy did you keep this from me? I had a sibling so close to home, and I had no idea!\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dWe didn\u2019t want to risk his safety. Even as a bastard, he could still be a threat to potential enemies. Either used as a tool in intrigues or being killed to prevent him from gaining the throne\u201d, is she referring to Lady Tremaine?<br>\r\nMe; \u201dStill, how did I have a brother?\u201d<br>\r\nZandria; \u201dGendry\u2019s mother was a worker at an alehouse here in the city. Right after you were born, your father and I went to that alehouse for a drink to celebrate your birth, while your mother rested and being comforted by Geecku. After drinking a lot, we invited the mother to a three-way, which resulted her having Gendry. We didn\u2019t know of course, and I didn\u2019t find out until years later, when his mother died. I saw that he was generally humble and polite, with interest in smithing. And that\u2019s how he ended up with Tommard\u201d<br>\r\nRobert Wolfsbane; \u201dHe\u2019s better off there than being threatened by the intrigues at court, if you ask me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing and went back to Miramis. Instead of riding back to the castle, I decided to ride to Street of Steel. Despite protests from the others, I rode hard as they\u2019re chasing me. No matter, what I want my brother at home!<br>\r\nBut just as I neared that street, I stopped. They were right, he\u2019s better off there than in the castle. Who knows what Tremaine or Blackadder would do to him?! When the others caught up, I said \u201dI\u2019m sorry\u201d, and Zandria laid a comforting hand on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when I turned to ride home, I heard a child scream down the street. Near a small market, I see a little boy laying on the ground, being picked on by two bigger boys. I went off the saddle and beckoned Sir Thomas and Sir Adrian to follow me. I planned on telling them off, but before I even got close, Gendry showed up and it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s bigger than them.<br>\r\nWhen they turned to his direction, they start to tremble in fear, and he told them while nearing them \u201dOh, you like picking on the little one, do you?\u201d, as he nears them the bullies back away slowly, \u201dYou know, I\u2019ve been hammering an anvil these past five years. When I hit that steel it <i>sings</i>. You gonna sing when I hit you?\u201d, and they ran off in fright.<br>\r\nI looked on in surprise while Gendry helped up the little boy, who then thanked him and skipped away home.<br>\r\nGendry then noticed me, \u201dWhat?\u201d he asked. I simply started to laugh, \u201dThose boys sure do run fast!\u201d, and Gendry started to laugh too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Gendry back to his home at Master Tommard\u2019s shop. Zandria and the rest of the council went back to the the castle while my guards followed us.<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dIs it true that you fought a bunch of Dragon-kin?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI even have the scars to prove it\u201d, indicating the left side of my face.<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dWell, I\u2019m impressed\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWith proper training, you could beat those bastards too\u201d, we arrived outside the shop.<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dI\u2019m a fighter\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dReally? Do you know how swing a sword?\u201d, I doubted that he ever had that kind of training.<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dI prefer a hammer\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell, if you ever wish to be a warrior\u201d, I tossed him a little something, \u201dMy master-at-arms could always use another student\u201d<br>\r\nI then went up on the saddle again and rode off.

While reading \u201dthe Conquest of  Aeryn\u201d (which was written by Edward V Pendragon, also known as \u201dthe Young Dragon\", detailing the attempt to subjugate the dragon-kin, a war that resulted with both his death and the deaths of 60 000 men), I was approached by my Kingsguard Sir Adrian, who was escorting a monk, young and overweight with short brown hair (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://amp.thisisinsider.com/images/59759484b4ec01983d8b4b83-750-563.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://amp.thisisinsider.com/images/597...</a>). Following them was the priest responsible for the royal chapel in the castle, Father Bohemond.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat do we have here\u201d, Adrian was about to answer when he was interrupted by Father Bohemond.<br>\r\nFather Bohemond; \u201dNothing to concern you, my king\u201d, he turned to the knight and the monk, \u201dYou will not waste the king\u2019s time with your nonsense!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI will the judge of that and I don\u2019t remember talking to you\u201d, he looked at me with shock while I turned my attention to the guest, \u201dNow, who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dBrother Sam from Reikland of the Empire of Sigmar, Your Majesty\u201d, said the monk bowed in a sign of respect.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dThe guards simply let him into the castle, probably because he looks very harmless\u201d, he chuckles before continuing, \u201danyway, he wishes to work here in the library\u201d<br>\r\nSam; \u201dI can speak for myself, you know\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat brings you from Reikland to Albion?\u201d<br>\r\nSam; \u201dOh well, I have always been interested in the histories of Albion, especially House Pendragon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nFather Bohemond; \u201dAnd carrying an empty book that is too big!\u201d<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dNo one permitted you speak\u201d<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I notice the book Sam were carrying, \u201dToo big for what?\u201d I asked the priest.<br>\r\nFather Bohemond; \u201dToo big for you to write\u201d<br>\r\nSam; \u201dIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean for the king to write, he could have servants to do it\u201d<br>\r\nFather Almaric; \u201dI still believe it\u2019s a waste of time\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dLet me see\u201d<br>\r\nBrother Sam laid the big book at the time on the table. It's white, two feet tall, a foot and a half wide, and a thousand pages thick. Empty pages. And it hit me\u2026<br>\r\nFather Bohemond; \u201dYou see? It\u2019s nonsense\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou know what your problem is, Bohemond?\u201d, I lifted my head to look at him, \u201dIt\u2019s that you don\u2019t know me at all\u201d, he looked at me in complete and utter shock.<br>\r\nI simply raised up from the chair, and took the book before telling Brother Sam \u201dthe library is yours. Adrian, follow me\u201d, and he and I left the library, leaving behind a smiling young man and a shocked old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater I was in the White Sword Tower overlooking the bay with Sir Thomas and Sir Adrian. On the table lies the book that Sam was carrying. \u201dI have an idea for this book\u201d I told them.<br>\r\nAdrian Connor; \u201dLet\u2019s hear it then\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dEach member will have one page, detailing his deeds and exploits. And it will be the responsibility of the current commander to update the entries in the book. It will formally be known as the Book of Brothers.\u201d<br>\r\nThomas Marshall; \u201dI like the idea\u201d<br>\r\nAdrain Connor; \u201dMe too, but the pages looks a little too plain, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou\u2019re right. Good thing we have monks in the cathedral who do drawings. I was thinking this way: on the top left-hand corner will be the personal arms of the member while at the bottom right-hand corner are the arms of the Kingsguard. Sounds good?\u201d<br>\r\nThey both agreed and it was decided that I will have a servant sent with the book and instructions to the cathedral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, I went back to my chambers. Sarah, the servant girl, had fed Balto, who is napping in his basket. I stroked on his head before sitting on the edge of my bed, taking off my boots.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened, and the person who entered was Panthy, the furry panther priestess. Wearing nothing but a loose and revealing black silk robe. \u201dWhat do you want?\u201d I asked, and she answered \u201dPleasing the gods\u201d, getting closer and closer to the bed.<br>\r\nBefore I could protest, she locked her lips to mine and my protests faded away from my mind. I then stripped her and groped her large breasts.<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... Gods...\" I lost the ability to speak as Panthy sank on her knees and unlaced my breeches before proceeding to give me one of the best blowjob of my young life. My cock was barely out of my pants when Panthy began suck it with an expertise (similar to Geecku and Zandria) that I was too afraid to question were she had learned. Her soft lips, dexterous tongue and expertise technique brought me to the brink of release within mere minutes. Sensing that my control was beginning to falter, Panthy pulled my cock out of her mouth, stripped my clothes off and made me go further to the center of the bed.<br>\r\nI looked on in awe as the goddess of a panther forcefully pushed me onto the bed before moaning loudly as she impaled herself upon my 8 inch cock. I had rarely seen a more beautiful sight than the one before me as Panthy began to rock above me. Panthy\u2019s face was contorted in sheer pleasure, her cheeks flushed pink in arousal as her black hair cascaded down her black furred body to partially hide her well-endowed round breasts from my gaze. I was more than happy to merely lay back and let this experienced female do all the work.<br>\r\nKeeping one hand on her narrow waist so as to guide her wild and erratic movements, I reached up with my free hand and cupped her soft breast, which were bouncing mere inches in front of my face. Panthy would emit the sweet moans whenever I play and twist her diamond-hard nipples.<br>\r\nShe then starts a prayer in her native tongue while purring loudly, and I continued his assault on Panthy\u2019s breast as I begun to pick up the pace and thrust up into her sopping pussy. I replaced my fingers on her breast with my mouth and my tongue sent shivers down her back.<br>\r\nWith both hands now free, I grabbed her round bouncing ass cheeks, desperate to reach even deeper into Panthy\u2019s cunt as I pushed her further upon my length. I could feel the tension building in my balls and judging by how she was spasming uncontrollably above me, I knew that her orgasm was not far away.<br>\r\nTime seemed to stopped as I looked up into Panthy\u2019s dark green eyes as we both chased our mutual orgasm simultaneously. Her body locked up and her pussy squeezed my pistoning cock in a death grip as she orgasm upon her young lover's cock. We stared into each others eyes as I followed her over the edge and released my virile semen into the warm, wet and fertile love canal of the priestess. Copious amounts of human seed filled Panthy to the brim until it began to seep out of where she and I were joined.<br>\r\nAfter resting a bit (and despite the fact that she could get pregnant like Akita, Sheila, Artica and Bruma), I positioned her so she on all fours, and then started pounding on her from behind. And she kept on moaning while praying\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I woke up alone on my messy bed. Panthy had probably gone up early and went back to the others in the Maidenvault.<br>\r\nAfter finishing my breakfast I got a welcoming visit from Balian, the next baron of Ibelin. \u201dSo, how find you Camelot?\u201d I asked while we walked to the courtyard.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dThe gods does not speak to me. Not even in the cathedral, or any temple or chapel in the city. I am outside their grace\u201d, there were hints of sadness in his words.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dReally? I have not heard that\u201d<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dAt any rate, it seems I have lost my religion\u201d, he stopped when I stopped.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBy the word religion, I\u2019ve seen and read the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the \u201dWill of the Gods\u201d. My marshal, Sir Robert, have seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves. And goodness - what the gods desires\u201d, pointing at his head, \u201dis here\u201d, then heart, \u201dand here. And what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man, or not\u201d, I smile and we both continue walking to the courtyard. After all, it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been training with swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half before the high noon we were done with the training with Sir Kyle Connor, father of the Connor-brothers and the castle\u2019s master-at-arms. I escorted Balian to his horse at the royal stables and I asked him about Sir David Hospital, and Balian said that he took a ship yesterday to Marienburg to travel to the holy lands in the east.<br>\r\nWhile Balian was readying his horse, I received word from a guard that a young man at the main gate showed them a ring with the royal sigil and was invited to be a squire. It must Gendry. I told the guard to take him to the stables.<br>\r\nHe, along with Sir Thomas and Sir Adrian, showed up just as Balian was about to ride out. Balian looked at Gendry and said \u201dYou\u2019re a blacksmith?\u201d, and Gendry answered \u201dAye, an apprentice\u201d.<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dI too am a blacksmith\u201d<br>\r\nGendry; \u201d(chuckle) Says the knight in armour\u201d<br>\r\nBalian; \u201dAnd a blacksmith\u201d<br>\r\nHe then went off to his manse in the city. Gendry looked at me confused, \u201dLong story\u201d, I told him. I went to Miramis, my horse, to pet him.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI certainly didn\u2019t expect you come here. So, what brings you?\u201d<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dI was hoping you could tell me, brother\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I heard the words, I froze\u2026</span></div></div>",

The two Kingsguards looks at each other and silently nodded before doing as they were told.<br>\r\nAs soon as the doors to the stables were closed, I turned around to Gendry and said \u201dWhat?!\u201d. He walks closer to me as he spoke, \u201dI became a blacksmith\u2019s apprentice without paying a penny, two council lords asks me questions about me and my mum and you looked at me with that strange look, not to mention that we have similar appearance even though we have different mothers\u201d, he stops a few feet away, \u201dYou didn\u2019t think I would be suspicious about you giving me this ring?\u201d, he tossed back the ring to me, \u201dNow I want the truth, please\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told him everything, from his mother meeting father and Zandria to the day we met.<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dHoly shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYeah, hard to believe, I know\u201d<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dNot only a king\u2019s brother, but a brother of a furry princess too\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI myself wanted siblings when I was a little boy\u201d, I look into his eyes, \u201dWhy are you here? I didn\u2019t expect you to just get into the castle after just one night\u201d<br>\r\nGendry; \u201dIt\u2019s just that\u2026 For years, I\u2019ve had this feeling inside me. Something that makes me feel that I want something more in my life. Every time I swing the hammer down on the anvil, I think \u201dWhat if I swing a weapon?\u201d. Before I became an apprentice for Master Tommard, I didn\u2019t stand by while big boys beat the little boys. For years I fought big boys while I defended the little ones. I think that maybe there\u2019s a real fighter in me. Maybe even a warrior. I sometimes pray to Ulric, the god of winter, wolves and battle, for strength when I work in the forge. Ulric is a warrior too, from what I know. I talked with Master Tommard last night, and he told me that I\u2019m free to choose my own path. I figure maybe I could find my path here\u201d.<br>\r\nI honestly must say that I\u2019m impressed. He\u2019s smarter than he seems, I guess. \u201dWell, if you want to be a warrior, or a knight if you wish it, you\u2019ll need to train and practice with a lot of different weapons. And also, you\u2019re 15 years old, so becoming a warrior will not be easy since you\u2019ve only been swinging hammers, not swords\u201d, I told him, \u201dThought as much\u201d, he replied, \u201dWhile I don\u2019t know about swinging swords\u201d, he reaches from his backpack, \u201dBut this\u2026\u201d, and he shows a two-handed warhammer (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/599c43deebbd1a90cffe47c3/599c442c59cc682bd664e65a/1503413428563/mgot_s7_ep05_gendry_slide00_01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5...</a>), custom-made from the look of it, \u201dThis I know\u201d. \u201dWell\u2026 I better warn you. It\u2019s very dangerous being a royal bastard, especially when members of the court eyes on the throne. So, it\u2019s probably better that we keep your origin to ourselves. It\u2019s complicated enough already\u201d, I told him, and he asks \u201dThen what shall we say I am?\u201d, and I answered, \u201dThat you\u2019re Gendry, a blacksmith\u2019s apprentice wanting to be a household guard\u201d, he pauses for a moment, before saying \u201dI understand\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI introduced him to Sir Kyle. At first he had doubts, but when Gendry tested his warhammer by breaking off a head of a practice-doll with one swing, he decided to make Gendry a proper fighter with two-handed weapons.<br>\r\nRight after that, I noticed my chancellor, Earl Edwin Rainheart, were heading towards a group of riders that have entered the castle. And they happen to be his daughter Margaret Rainheart, her handmaidens and the household guard loyal to their family.<br>\r\nAs I got closer, I see Earl Edwin embrace his daughter in hug, telling her how much he missed her. I also noticed that her body has grown much since she was here last time four years ago: her face is more beautiful, her long hair reaches down to her behind and her breasts got bigger. Round, full and straining against the fabric of the dress.<br>\r\nOnce I got close enough, I hear them talking.<br>\r\nMargaret Rainheart; \u201dIt\u2019s great to be in the capital again. Four years is too long\u201d, she\u2019s one of those noble girls who would rather spend time sightseeing in a city than sitting alone in their castles.<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dFound anyone suitable yet?\u201d, I chuckle to myself remembering that he\u2019s been trying to find a husband for his eldest daughter, who turned 18 this year.<br>\r\nMargaret Rainheart; \u201dFather! The last thing I want to hear, while we\u2019re in the capital, is marriage!\u201d, of course, she\u2019s very annoyed by that.<br>\r\nEdwin Rainheart; \u201dBut please dear\u2026\u201d, then he notices me, \u201dOh, Your Majesty, good day!\u201d, his daughter and her handmaidens bowed their heads.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dEarl Edwin, I see your daughter has arrived\u201d, I turned to Lady Margaret, taking her hand to kiss it, \u201dAnd prettier than the last time she was here\u201d.<br>\r\nMargaret Rainheart; \u201d(Giggle) Please stop, Your Majesty, you\u2019re making me blush\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBut it\u2019s no less true\u201d, I then turn my attention to her handmaidens, who I\u2019ve never seen before, \u201dAnd who are these fair maidens?\u201d, the girls giggles hearing that.<br>\r\nMargaret Rainheart; \u201dMy handmaidens of four years, and good friends\u201d, she turned to the girl with brown hair and brown eyes, \u201dThis is Sera\u201d, then she turned to the brunette girl with dark green eyes, \u201dAnd this is Lady Mira of House Forrester\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dMira Forrester? Duke Gregor\u2019s Daughter?\u201d<br>\r\nMira Forrester; \u201dYes, Your Majesty\u201d, she bowed her head.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI met your family at Wood\u2019s Mark. Your father and brother are great men\u201d, the Forresters remained there a bit, to make sure that the ruins and the treasure vault are well guarded by both local barons and some of their men. The family should be arriving sometime today.<br>\r\nMira Forrester; \u201dThank you, Your Majesty. If I may ask, what happened with your face?\u201d, referring to my scars on on my left side.<br>\r\nMargaret Rainheart; \u201dI\u2019m curious about that too\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201d(sigh) Long story. Trust me, you\u2019ll hear it a lot, soon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden, we hear a horn sound from one of the towers. \u201dWhat was that?\u201d, Sera asked, \u201dThat particular horn is sounded whenever a griffon or hippogryph rider shows up\u201d, I replied, knowing who it is.<br>\r\nAnd without warning, Duke Endrew Frost of the North landed Ygritte the griffon right on the courtyard a few feet from the Stone. Everyone in the courtyard looked at them in both shock and awe. As for his direwolf pup, Ghost, he was safely tucked in Endrew\u2019s thick coat.<br>\r\nIn a long story short: we greeted each other, he introduced himself to Earl Edwin, his daughter and her handmaidens (Mira Forrester shows a great interest in the young duke), and I picked up Gendry after he dropped to the ground when Ygritte showed up. I laughed when I told him \u201dI\u2019d say you get used to them\u2026 but, you never really do\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards, the inquisition had arrived\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201dI hope it doesn\u2019t disturb you that many of the participants in the tourney are of different faith?\u201d, I asked the inquisitor, who is an elderly man with thin grey hair and a thick beard, dressed in robes. His companion is a warrior priest of the Cult of Sigmar, the first emperor and the patron God of the Empire (each god have their own cult). \u201dAs long as they submit to your rule and pay their taxes, I shall ignore\u201d, he answered, as I lead them down the stairs to the dungeons, \u201dNow, who are the heretics?\u201d.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe Bishop, Heraclitus, and his three priests\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dWhat are their crimes?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe Bishop hid the fact that the three priests were pedophiles, while drinking, whoring and eating himself fat\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dWHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\nWe then reached the cells and I ordered the guard to opened the door to the cell they shared. Inside all four of them were half-naked and chained up to the walls. As soon as the bishop saw me he shouted out \u201dRelease me at once! When the High Priest hears of this\u2026\u201d, he then went silent when he saw the inquisitor and the warrior priest.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe won\u2019t interested in what you would have to say, when he hears from this man\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dWhen you left Altdorf and went to Albion, you were lean and healthy. Now I see you\u2019ve done two of the seven sins of the Faith: gluttony and lust\u201d, his voice is filled with disgust and anger.<br>\r\nBishop Heraclitus; \u201dDear inquisitor, please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dWorse, you hid child molesters in our Faith!\u201d, he turned to the three priests, who all shivered in fright, \u201dVerena, Goddess of Justice, will bring her fury upon your hypocrisy and injustice\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few hours the inquisitor interrogated the rest of the priests, priestesses, monks and nuns in the city, plus servants and any witnesses (including Sparrows), puts the few corrupt priests in house arrest within the cathedral, and then sentences Heraclitus, and his accomplices, to death. The three child molesters are to be hanged while the former bishop, who was too fat, is to be beheaded. Since there is currently no royal executioner at the moment (the last one retired a couple of years ago and left for Narnia), Sir Mors Westford volunteered for the position, and I reluctantly accepted.<br>\r\nBefore that, however, there is to be a stoning of a blasphemer. Stoning is a rare punishment for the most severe and horrible of a blasphemy. This guilty one was a priest, half naked and have his back against the wall, and a large crowd was gathering with as many rocks they could find and carry. I was there with the inquisitor, the council, my bodyguards and my Kingsguard.<br>\r\nThen the priest spoke up, \u201dI really don\u2019t understand why everyone is making such a fuss of what I said? I was having a lovely supper, and all I said was \u2019this piece of meat was good enough for \u2019Trump\u2019\u201d, in response the crowd screamed curses at him and made a lot of \u2019boo\u2019.<br>\r\nYou see, Donald Trump was the name of a man who was a greedy, lying, and utterly stupid merchant from Marienburg, who turned himself into a demon who was so annoying, that a Templar knight had to chop off his head just to shut him up. Since then, in the last thousand years, it was forbidden by the Faith to utter the name \u201dTrump\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dBlasphemy!\u201d, the inquisitor shouted, \u201dHe\u2019s done it again!\u201d. Suddenly, a rock came flying at the priest\u2019s head, \u201dOw!\u201d he shouted, \u201dWe haven\u2019t started yet!\u201d. \u201dWho threw that?!\u201d, I asked the crowd, who pointed at a young man who looked very eager to throw rocks, but stood still when he saw me looking at him with a raised eyebrow and my hands on the hips, \u201dI thought we started\u201d, he mumbled, \u201dGo to the back\u201d I told him.<br>\r\nJust when the inquisitor has finished reading the sentence, the priest talked again, \u201dLook, I don\u2019t think it ought to be blasphemy, just saying \u2019Trump\u2019\u201d, everyone gasps, \u201dSilence, fool!\u201d, I told him, \u201dYou're only making it worse for yourself!\u201d, \u201dMaking it worse?\u201d he replied, \u201dHow could it be worse? Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!\u201d, he kept on chanting and dancing with his legs.<br>\r\nI then lost my temper and yelled at him \u201dI'm warning you! If you say \"Trump\" once more\u2026\u201d, and then I get hit by a rock on the back of my head. I turned to the crowd, \u201dWho threw that?!\u201d I asked, \u201dCome on, who threw that?\u201d, several people pointed at a middle-aged woman, who looked guilty. I walked up to her, \u201dWas it you?\u201d I asked her, and her reply was \u201dYes, well you did say\u2026 \u2019you know who\u2019\u201d. Realizing that, I felt ashamed. I apologized to everyone, and let the inquisitor continue. \u201dNow look\u201d he told everyone in the crowd, \u201dno one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle, do you understand? Even - and I want to make this absolutely clear - even if they do say \u2019you know who\u2019\u201d, and then he blew the whistle.<br>\r\nRight after that, the three child molesting priests were hanged, and Heraclitus had his head cut off by Westford wielding a large two-handed axe. He seems perfect for the job, I probably would have to make a permanent residence in the city for him and his family.<br>\r\nBefore we went back to the castle with others, the inquisitor approached me.<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dWe need to find a new bishop\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI agree\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dWhich of the priests and priestesses would you recommend?\u201d, that\u2019s when I thought of the sparrows.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou\u2019ve met the Sparrows, I presume?\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dYes, I talked with a few of them, including one whose brother was one of the child-victims. Although I do not agree some of their opinions, they are an interesting group of people and their work with the poor is admirable, even in the eyes of Goddess Shallya. And their leader, High Sparrow, is an interesting man\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIndeed he is. And I would rather see him as a bishop, as I can\u2019t trust the rest at the moment\u201d<br>\r\nThe inquisitor paused for a moment before saying \u201dvery well\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming back to the castle, I asked Zandria to send after Geecku to my chambers, I have been feeling very stressful during the whole inquisition and need to get rid of it.<br>\r\nI started by fucking from behind, and after that let her ride me in full speed and we spent most of the night switching positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next morning, I headed to the cathedral with my Kingsguard, Thomas and Adrian. When we rode up to the cathedral, I noticed a small group of men from the city watch, Gold cloaks, chatting near the entrance.<br>\r\nGold Cloak 1; \u201dAnother young man was murdered yesterday\u201d, this one is a young man, with black bowl haircut and a serious face.<br>\r\nGold Cloak 2; \u201dReally?\u201d, another young man in similar age, with a bit of sarcasm.<br>\r\nGold Cloak 1; \u201dA potter\u2019s apprentice, a redhead named Harry. The murderer will pay\u201d<br>\r\nGold Cloak 2; \u201dWhy do you care, Marlowe?\u201d, what?<br>\r\nMarlowe; \u201dWhat kind of question is that Jerry? No one escapes the law. By the will of Verena, the Goddess of Justice, the murderers will suffer for their actions!\u201d, sounds like my type of lawman.<br>\r\nJerry; \u201d(laughs)!\u201d, what the hell is he laughing about? \u201dSeriously, Marlowe, we Gold cloaks have enough to do than wasting time on dead bodies?!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHow dare you say that?!\u201d<br>\r\nThey both at first froze when they heard and saw me, then both straighten themselves and salute. I got off my horse and marched straight towards them and begins to scold Jerry. \u201dDo you find it funny disrespecting the dead?!\u201d, Jerry hastily shook his, not wanting to disrespect me, the king \u201dWearing that cloak doesn\u2019t mean you can just lay back and relax. It is your duty to uphold and enforce the law and defend this city, meaning you owe it to the citizens that the guilty ones of Harry\u2019s murder is answered for. Do you understand me?\u201d, he shakingly nodded his head.<br>\r\nI turned to the other one, \u201dMarlowe, right?\u201d, I asked him, \u201dYes, Your Majesty\u201d, he replied.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHarry was not the first victim?\u201d<br>\r\nMarlowe; \u201dHe\u2019s the third redhead being murdered within a few weeks\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dYou\u2019ve been in the City Watch long?\u201d<br>\r\nMarlowe; \u201dA month, along with Jerry here. But I\u2019m determined to do justice in this city\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dA righteous man is just what this city needs. Keep up the good work, Marlowe\u201d, I then turned to walk towards the entrance, but not before giving Jerry a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we entered the cathedral, I heard \u201dYour Majesty?\u201d, and looking to the direction, I see Baron Harold Clifford, Stephen\u2019s father.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBaron Clifford? What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\nHarold Clifford; \u201dTo witness the tourney with my family, as for in here, my son Stephen is praying by the altar of the Lady of the Lake\u2026 I fear for him\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat do you mean?\u201d, I\u2019m still a bit angry for what Stephen did.<br>\r\nHarold Clifford; \u201dEver since the incident with the horse and you yelling at him, he became so sad and depressed that he hardly sleep and eat, and he constantly pray to the Gods for forgiveness for his behavior\u201d<br>\r\nNow I feel regret for how I treated him, even though he deserved it. I went to where he was, and find him with his knees on the floor, his elbows on the altar of the Goddess, his hands held tightly together, and deep in a prayer, \u201dMy Lady, please forgive me for letting my jealousy and anger control my actions\u2026 it cost me not only my honor, but my friendship with Arthur\u201d, hearing that makes me feel sad, \u201dI pray that he find it in his heart to forgive me\u2026 I will do anything he asks, I will not take a wife or father any children, I will give my life to protect him from any danger\u201d. Hearing enough, I placed my hand on his shoulder, he looked up at me, I pulled him up, and with my hands on his shoulders, I told him \u201dThere is one thing\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was with the inquisitor and High Sparrow in the chambers of the former bishop, we all sat on chairs and are talking about High Sparrow\u2019s past.<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dYou were a cobbler from Wickford?\u201d, I\u2019m surprised myself.<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dAs my father was before me. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dQuality takes time\u201d, the inquisitor nodded in agreement.<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dYes. I imagine you\u2019ve worn a year of someone\u2019s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAnd one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of Morr, verse 25\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dYou know \u2019the Verses of Faith\u2019\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019ve been taught in religion from when I was a boy, by priestess Unella who often read it to me. At me\u201d, the two men of the Faith chuckled at it.<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dYes, I remember her years ago, she does enjoy reading at people\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dYou\u2019re close. But it wasn\u2019t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dSo what did you do?\u201d, still in a bit disbelief.<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dI left to go and find them. I didn\u2019t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back. I even gave up my own name and therefore became nameless. After that I took the vows of priesthood. Since then I\u2019ve been allover the kingdom, even visited the dukedoms of Bretonnia, helping the poor with food and clothing, preaching the wisdoms of the gods, even performing wedding ceremonies and funerals\u2026 one thing I remember most is when I traveled the roads of Couronne three years ago. It have been raining for several days, when I came across an old knight and his squire. The knight was too weak to ride and was nearing death. I witnessed him knight the young squire and helped burying him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAre you talking about Sir Duncan?\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dYou\u2019ve met?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHe\u2019s right now outside the city walls with his squire\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dReally? Then I better seek them out soon. But let\u2019s go to we're here for\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dRight. We fear that Heraclitus\u2019 heresy and corruption may have involved other priests in the region and it\u2019s necessary to appoint a new bishop to lead the hunt\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dI wish the new bishop good fortune\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWe\u2019re looking at him\u201d<br>\r\nThe look on his face was a combination surprise and disbelief, \u201dMe? A Bishop with no name?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019d prefer to call you High Sparrow, if that\u2019s alright with you?\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dIt was His Majesty here who preferred you, I don\u2019t blame him as most of the common people doesn\u2019t fully trust the rest of the priests and priestesses in the city. Although I\u2019m not really sure about your group. Such as your opinions on same gender relations\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201d(chuckle) Well I certainly don\u2019t blame you, dear Inquisitor. While it\u2019s a norm in Narnia beyond the Great Ocean, it\u2019s not unusual in Estalia and Telia if I\u2019m correct?\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201d(sigh) Despite attempts from the Faith\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dStill, an honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhich is why you were chosen\u201d, he smiles in response, \u201dWe all know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. Kings before me couldn\u2019t always punish those deserved it most\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dAll sinners are equal before the Gods\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dAgreed. I have been searching through the documents belonging to the former bishop and found out that he had been donating large sums of money over the years to Lord Marius\u2019 estate\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dMarius? That Tilean who lives north of here?\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dYes, he\u2019s been keeping the estate in the name of the High Priest\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThe land used to be a barony, from what I\u2019ve read\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dWhat\u2019s so special about this Tilean?\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dHis son, Alecto, is the High Priest\u2019s favorite godson. \u2019Destined to be a High Priest\u2019 he once said\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dThat\u2019s a lot of expectations for a godson, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIndeed\u201d<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dIf Marius is really a heretic, then we must find out\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dHis estate is only a few hours from the capital. You coming along, High Sparrow, as you\u2019re the bishop of this region?\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dMay Goddess Verena judge him justly\u201d, he smiles.<br>\r\nInquisitor; \u201dThen it\u2019s settled. We leave in 2 days, if that is alright?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dShould be alright\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dThat should give me enough settle things in our holy temple. Right now I\u2019ll begin my term by selling all that is made of cloth and gold, and use the money we earn to by food for the poor. I\u2019ll also get rid off all the wine from the cathedral\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI heard that every time he drank wine while meeting with the Council, he asked for the vintage\u201d<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow; \u201dOur minds are temples to the Gods and should be kept pure. Also, (chuckles) I don\u2019t like the taste\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201d(chuckles) Neither do I, I prefer water and fruit juice\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas Marshall, Adrian Connor and Stephen Clifford (he got his white cloak from Thomas, who had been keeping the cloaks in his saddle bag) have been guarding High Sparrow\u2019s new chambers for some time after the Inquisitor left while I was speaking with High Sparrow. Then I opened the doors to let them in.<br>\r\nI had been explaining about my new elite guard to him, and he agreed that their vows shall be taken in sight of Gods, as he\u2019s a representative of the Gods.<br>\r\nWhen the three knights kneeled down they swear to protect their king and the royal family with their own lives, to obey his commands, and to keep his secrets, sworn for life and to never owning lands, taking a wife, or fathering children.<br>\r\nAnd when they returned standing on their feet, they are the White Swords of Albion: the Kingsguard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was standing outside Master Tommard\u2019s shop waiting for my three Kingsguard knights. As soon as we left the cathedral, I was approached by a boy with a message from Master Tommard, saying that he had just made three suits of white armour instead of two.<br>\r\nWhile waiting I received a message from Zandria, my Spy Mistress, saying that more gold and weapons of elven steel from the treasure chamber beneath Wood\u2019s Mark has arrived. Which is good, since I\u2019m going to pay a lot of gold once all the Kingsguard-armour are are done. She also wrote that her spies are getting ready for infiltrating the City Watch-headquarters, and are waiting for my orders.<br>\r\nSir Adrian Connor was first to come out, and I got a good look at the new armour (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/e9b0/th/pre/i/2013/123/c/2/ser_loras_tyrell_by_acidfusion-d63zorx.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://pre00.deviantart.net/e9b0/th/pre...</a>). Now I\u2019m officially impressed! Next came Sir Thomas Marshall and Sir Stephen Clifford, and following them was Master Tommard.<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dYou like?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dVery much, thank you!\u201d, Tommard gives a big smile, \u201dAs soon as all the armour are ready, you will be paid handsomely\u201d<br>\r\nMaster Tommard; \u201dI thank you, Your Majesty\u201d, he bows, \u201dAnd how\u2019s Gendry doing?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell, he\u2019s making progress with two-handed weapons very quickly. Good day to you, Master Tommard\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of us took a tour through the city, on horseback, towards the docks. Adrian and Stephen are very impressed by Master Tommard\u2019s work and like their new armour a lot. I told Sir Thomas, Commander of the Kingsguard, that it would be great for Gendry if he squires for him, to which Marshall agreed.<br>\r\nAs we arrived at the docks, I see it filled with merchants from other nations emptying their ships with goods to trade, and visitors who plans to either view or participate the tourney. Soon we noticed two men from the City Watch patrolling: the recruits Marlowe and Jerry.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWell, hello again\u201d, they both saluted without stopping. While Marlowe looked at my face, Jerry kept on looking forward, being scared of my presence.<br>\r\nMarlowe; \u201dGreetings, Your Majesty\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dPatrolling the docks, I see?\u201d, I see Jerry relax a bit.<br>\r\nJerry; \u201dYeah, since the senior officers are too busy spending all their time gambling and drinking while leaving us recruits to do all the work!\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\nJerry; \u201dThe whole reason I joined the Watch was to get lazy, I mean it\u2019s no secret that the Watch is corrupt, but I didn\u2019t expect them to dump all their work on us recruits! On our first week while on duty, Marlowe saw and confronted higher ranking officers that were illegally selling some City Watch breastplates to a Marienburg-merchant\u2026\u201d, Marlowe continued.<br>\r\nMarlowe; \u201dWhen I threatened to report them, they beat me up. Jerry and other recruits intervened, and the officers decided to let me off the hook. Commander Slynt later told me to mind my own business!\u201d<br>\r\nJerry; \u201dEven the commander himself is taking bribes. Even selling positions and promotions, and I hear that half the officers are paying part of their salaries!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel anger rise up inside me while hearing all that. I have to appoint a Lawmaker, bring painful discipline to the City Watch and get rid of that idiot commander!<br>\r\nMarlowe then muttered \u201dYou got to be kidding me\u201d, while he stopped and looked at one of the port bridges. The rest of us look the same direction and I see two gold cloak officers talking with a merchant. \u201dAre those two the ones that had beaten you?\u201d I asked Marlowe, and he nodded. I got off Miramis and marched strait towards them, the others followed suit.<br>\r\nGetting closer, I see the merchant is an Estalian, judging from his clothing and the flag on top of his ship. And I hear what they\u2019re talking about. From the look of it, a heated argument.<br>\r\nEstalian; \u201dAs I said, your mouths are full of shit\u201d, his accent confirms he\u2019s from Estalia.<br>\r\nWatch officer 1; \u201dYou doubt the Crown putting extra taxes on goods?!\u201d, sounds like he and his friend are being irritated.<br>\r\nEstalian; \u201dNot the Crown, just you\u201d<br>\r\nWatch officer 2; \u201dOnce the Crown hears of this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI just did\u201d, they turn to my direction, the officers had shock visible on their faces, while the merchant looked amused.<br>\r\nWatch officer 2; \u201d(whisper) Oh shit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nWatch officer 1; \u201dYour Majesty! Uh, we were just\u2026\u201d, he looks at both me and the recruits.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dFilling your pockets?\u201d, I marched closer.<br>\r\nWatch officer 1; \u201dNo, it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d, with speed, I grabbed his collar and had my dagger pointed at his crotch.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dGive me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t let my executioner kill you\u201d<br>\r\nThe officer is trembling with fear, while the other has no idea what to do. Then the merchant spoke up, \u201dhow about I give them something better then money?\u201d, I turned to him, \u201dand that is?\u201d, I asked him, not putting away the blade.<br>\r\nHe turned to two crewmen carrying a big basket, whistled and beckoned them over. Once they put the basket down next to him, he pulled the cover to show it\u2019s filled with fermented meat. The officers twist their faces in disgust. \u201dFermented crab!\u201d, he shouted with pride.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?\u201d, the Kingsguard, Marlowe and Jerry, and the officers were equally confused.<br>\r\nEstalian; \u201dFermented crab. A very popular product in southern Middle Earth. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste\u201d<br>\r\nHe scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the officers. I let go of the one I was holding and put away my dagger. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.<br>\r\nEstalian; \u201dI'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a hole in that chainmail\u201d, he laughs and the officers did too, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both walked away, and when they pass the recruits, they were given deadly glares and started walking as fast as they could. When they were gone, I laughed very hard, and so did the rest, even the serious Marlowe laughed a little.<br>\r\nWhile the Estalian laugh, I see a voluptuous cobra (a hooded snake), sneak up behind him and turned him towards her, and they started kissing with passionate lust and groped one another. \u201dNot much for public decency, huh?\u201d, Adrian said with a smirk, \u201dMeaning no offense, but what do you expect from Estalians and furries?\u201d, I replied. The cobra-woman looked at me sideways, stopped kissing and asked her lover \u201dMind introducing us?\u201d, and he said \u201dOh right! Sorry, Your Majesty, I\u2019m Oberyn, but you probably know me as\u2026\u201d, and then we hear a very familiar voice, \u201dthe Red Viper!\u201d, I see Alester Sarwyck walk up the bridge, \u201dI recognized that handsome face wherever I go!\u201d he said. \u201dAlester?!\u201d, said Oberyn the Estalian, before he brought Earl Alester in a tight hug.<br>\r\nAfter hearing \u201dthe Red Viper\u201d, I realized that this Oberyn is non other than Oberyn Martell, Prince of Estalia, brother of King Doran Martell, and a descendent of Nymeria.<br>\r\nThe Red Viper is known to be one of the deadliest warriors the world has ever seen. His adventures in both Middle Earth and Narnia are legendary. He earned the name by friends and foes alike, due to rumors that he fought a duel with a poisoned blade. It is said that he beds both men and women, and has several bastards, including eight acknowledged daughters he takes responsibility for and raised them (something a few nobles and royalties do when it comes to their bastard offspring). He teaches them how to defend themselves and allows them great independence in growing up.<br>\r\nOberyn Martell; \u201dHow is the other half of \u201dDouble-edged Sword\u201d, it has been so long since I heard of you, I fought you no longer fought together\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIt\u2019s a long story\u201d<br>\r\nOberyn Martell; \u201dHow about we go to Chataya\u2019s brothel and you can tell me there? When was the last time you\u2026\u201d, he looked back at me, \u201dApologies, King Arthur, I almost forgot about you!\u201d, and he shook my hand.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dUh\u2026\u201d, I was shocked to see a living legend so close to me and him shaking my hand, \u201dI wasn\u2019t expected to have your presence here in Albion, much less disguised as a merchant!\u201d<br>\r\nOberyn Martell; \u201dEh, just my way of site seeing the city undisturbed. Plus\u2026\u201d, he went back to the cobra and wrapped a arm around her thin waist, \u201dMy Ellaria here haven\u2019t tried a blond before, and like very much to share one with me\u201d<br>\r\nEllaria; \u201dEllaria of the Sands\u201d, she extended her hand, which I kissed, \u201dThe other ships from Estalia with our daughters and Oberyn\u2019s niece, Princess Arianne, will be arriving soon\u201d, Arianne Martell is King Doran\u2019s daughter and heir.<br>\r\nI looked at the basket with the fermented crab, and then asked Prince Oberyn, \u201dWere you serious about the crab, or were you just tricking the officers?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dHe\u2019s more serious than you think!\u201d, said a man from the ship. This man has blond hair and beard, and dressed like a mercenary, \u201dI tasted that once, and my wife and I went at it through the whole night!\u201d, he said while laughing. Who is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWant to try it?\u201d, Oberyn asked me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Turns out Prince Oberyn not only had a few goods in his ship (borrowed it from an acquaintance), but a few passengers as well: a mercenary named Asher, his wife Gwyn and Asher\u2019s fellow mercenary, Beskha. Beskha is wearing leather armour and has two scars on her face (similar to mine).<br>\r\nNoting that I\u2019m still skeptical about the fermented crab, Oberyn convinced me to follow him and Alester to Chataya\u2019s brothel to try it out. And so I reluctantly followed him with Alester Sarwyck, Oberyn\u2019s paramour Ellaria, Beskha the mercenary, and of course, my Kingsguard. The Gold cloaks Marlowe and Jerry went on with their patrolling, while Asher stays in a inn facing the brothel with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe upscale brothel is a house four stories tall with a stone ground floor and three timber upper floor. A round turret rises from one corner of the structure. Many of the windows are leaded. Over the door swings an ornate lamp, a globe of gilded metal and scarlet glass.<br>\r\nWhen we were nearing the entrance, I come to think about last month when Zandria and Geecku told me of their times in there (the spy mistress obviously listened to whores often for information while Geecku worked part-time as a whore herself, before I came of age), and their description of the inside: Inside the entrance the air smells of exotic spice and the floor beneath displays a mosaic of two women entwined in love. The common room is behind an ornate Tilean screen that has been carved with flowers and fancies and dreaming maidens. There is a cushioned alcove and a leaded colored glass window where sunlight pours through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we entered, the air indeed smell exotic. Wherever I looked I see customers with women dressed in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts.<br>\r\nI remember Zandria tell that Chataya\u2019s girls are costly. She said that the girls are fit for a king. They are all as sweet as they are beautiful and skilled in every art of love.<br>\r\nNot all the girls are human, I note. While there are human girls of every skin color, there are also Furries of every kind from Narnia, and also a few pixies and a mermaid.<br>\r\nAs I looked over the place while the rest were just standing near the entrance, I suddenly see the most amazing furry I have ever seen: she\u2019s a brown-furred squirrel standing near the common room (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static1.e621.net/data/f4/16/f41649c908c379cd414ff9fbc347daaf.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://static1.e621.net/data/f4/16/f416...</a>), she has brown hair with a pink streak above her forehead and she\u2019s wearing a pink corset-like lingerie with darker pink spots, a pink collar with a golden ring and two big pink earrings. Her breasts are obscenely huge, each light brown and fleshy orb contained by the tight corset. They looked like they were going to burst out at any moment, any small movement she made sent those massive jugs bouncing and jiggling so much that it made the upper slopes, which could be seen through the opening the top had in the chest, to ripple enticingly. Going lower, I see her long, slender but toned legs and big and round ass. When I look back on her face, I see that she is wearing some bright pink lipstick on her full, plump lips, and her enticingly blue eyes are just beautiful. I then notice that she\u2019s stroking her right breast with the tip of her right fingers, seemingly inviting me over. Feeling my cock harder than ever before, I was about to go to her when I hear a smooth voice say \u201dNow here\u2019s a visitor who brings back pleasant memories\u201d, I turn to see the owner of the brothel, Chataya, who\u2019s a tall, black woman with sandalwood eyes, who walked up to Earl Alester, \u201dIs that really you, Earl Alester?\u201d.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIt has been a long time, Chataya\u201d, They know each?<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dIt has been years since you honored us with your presence. It\u2019s been so long, I thought you\u2019d lost interest in houses of pleasure\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dYou weren't wrong about that. For 15 years my eyes have been opened to Lightbringer, and I took up the red robes of the Cult\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dThe gods gave us voices with which to sing their praises, hands to build their temples and desire to honor them through our lovemaking\u201d, she\u2019s from one of those tribes in Southland who shares the same gods as the Furries.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dYou haven\u2019t changed, Chataya. But I have. Although I cannot deny that I would spend another moment with you\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dExcellent\u201d, she turns to the rest of us, \u201dWell, if it isn\u2019t the infamous Red Viper?\u201d<br>\r\nOberyn Martell; \u201dDear Chataya! You haven\u2019t aged a single day\u201d, he kissed her extended hand as a sign of respect.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dCharming as usual I see? And who is this fine specimen of a cobra?\u201d<br>\r\nEllaria; \u201dEllaria of the Sands, paramour and mother of four of his bastards\u201d, she politely kneed.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dAnd I don\u2019t doubt you both share many lovers in your bed?\u201d, both the prince and the cobra chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they talked, two pairs of hands each grabbed onto one of my arms. They belong to two Furries, a swan on my left and a bunny on my right, both pressing their breasts against my arms.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m Odette, and it\u2019s not everyday a king honors us with a visit\u201d, said the swan with an orange beak, very soft feathers on her body and her large breasts.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd I\u2019m Mercedes, and I can ride on you so long that you\u2019ll have to beg me to stop\u201d, whispered the rabbit with white fur, blonde hair and big breasts. \u201dI never begged in my life\u201d, I told while trying to keep my urges under control, and she replied \u201dOh trust me. You will\u2026\u201d, \u201dGirls\u201d, Chataya interrupted.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dLet the King first make a decision\u201d, when the girls let go of me she turned her attention to me, \u201dMy apologies, Your Majesty, most of my girls are Furry and Fae and they have a hard time to keep hold on their urges\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dNo apology needed\u201d, I kissed her hand, \u201dMy Spy Mistress and Geecku speak highly of you\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dNot surprising, as they are good friends of ours\u201d, she leaned in to whisper, \u201dAnd my girls are good at making men talk, which is useful for Zandria\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI don\u2019t find that surprising. What is surprising is that you and Earl Sarwyck here know each other\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dWhy, he and I are old lovers\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dI was a young man who was more interested in combat and laying with women\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dBut I do believe he\u2019s still the gentleman\u201d, Alester smiled, \u201dNow, Your Majesty, what brings you to our establishment?\u201d<br>\r\nOberyn; \u201dThis\u201d, he holds up a small bucket of the fermented crab, \u201dHe doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s really makes a man hard, so I brought him along so he can try it out and find out for himself!\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201d(chuckle) Fermented crab is very useful for our eldest of clients, and as for young men, well, he won\u2019t be able to get soft for several hours\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAah, so that\u2019s how you\u2019re getting very rich?\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dAny of my girls would be very willing to help, and if one girl gets too tired another could take her place. What do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could think or say, I suddenly hear Alester say \u201dGawen?\u201d, Then I see Alester\u2019s surprised brother get out of the common room with a young woman with blond hair. Both Alester and I went to him.<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dI\u2019m wondering the same thing\u201d<br>\r\nGawen Sarwyck; \u201dUh\u2026 Well\u2026 You see\u2026\u201d, he didn\u2019t what to say, fumbling his words, \u201dThis is Falena!\u201d, he finally said.<br>\r\nFalena; \u201dYou\u2019re Gawen\u2019s brother aren\u2019t you? And you must be King Arthur? I have never thought to see this day!\u201d<br>\r\nTurns out that during his visits at his family\u2019s manse in the capital, he developed a infatuation of sorts with Falena, one of Chataya\u2019s girls. They didn\u2019t sleep together all the time, they also spend time talking and playing games. Falena says that she knows the realities of her profession. Chataya treat them well, but in a few years, she will be too old to draw men\u2019s eyes. And what awaits her then? Begging or walking the docks? She wishes for Gawen or someone else to take her into her service. Not to marry him. She's not that naive. But he has always been attentive and charming. He or another lord would make a good master. They have talked about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I hear \u201dArthur?\u201d, I turn to the entrance to see Sir Aaron Price. Aaron is one of my most trusted friends, equally to Sir Adrian and his brothers. One of the best and most chivalrous of knights I have known in life, he was the last person I expect to find in a brothel. I excused Alester and the other two, and went to Aaron.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d, I asked him. Before he could answered, we hear someone call out his name. Heading towards is a young girl with light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and (thanks to the cleavage) her breasts. And I can\u2019t help but notice the baby in her arms\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A year ago, the 16-year-old Sir Aaron Price was passing through the city on his horse, when he heard a woman singing a beautiful song. He sees the pretty redhead walk the streets and followed her to Chataya\u2019s brothel. He went inside, ignored the other girls, mustered the courage to walk up to her, they talked in the common room for a long while, and it became clear that they fell in love. In that evening, he paid a Gold Crown to Chataya since 16-year-old Mhaegan was a virgin at that time. That night became the best in their lives. When he visited her again a week later, it was revealed that she became pregnant with his child (she forgot to take special herbs to prevent pregnancy and he was the only one she\u2019s been with), but that made him very happy. And he became happier for each day they spend together, and then their daughter was born, and Mhaegan named her Barra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had listened the whole story while all three of us sat in the common room. \u201dIsn\u2019t she beautiful?\u201d, Mhaegan asked while breastfeeding her daughter. Barra has the red hair and blue eyes of a Price and is named after Aaron\u2019s paternal grandmother.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAaron, what will your family think?\u201d, I just don\u2019t want him to get in trouble.<br>\r\nAaron Price; \u201dI don\u2019t care\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\nAaron Price; \u201dI\u2019m going to renounce my family name, marry Mhaegan, and we move as far away from Albion as we can\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dBut, to where?\u201d<br>\r\nAaron Price; \u201dTo Estalia, where prostitutes are more accepted, so I hear\u201d, he held his hand up to prevent me from talking, \u201dPlease, don\u2019t try to talk me out of it. Mother always talk about the importance of inheritance and marrying into families with power, wealth and influence. But our family have no lands, so what\u2019s there to inherit from? Only the title of Lord and some money. And I can\u2019t stand the thought of marry someone I don\u2019t love. I want to marry someone who loves me for me\u201d, he gently touched Barra\u2019s head while she\u2019s still feeding from her mother, \u201dI don\u2019t care what my family thinks. My sister, Sansa, or my cousins can inherit the title and whatever wealth we have. I just want our children to grow up being loved, and be free to choose their own lives\u201d<br>\r\nI sat there for a moment, before saying \u201dI wish you both good fortune\u201d, rose up and walked away. Who am I to stop Aaron choosing his own life? I envy him. If it were possible, I would have done the same thing. But the Kingdom would suffer for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to the entrance were Prince Oberyn, Alester and my Kingsguard were waiting. Beskha is walking away with lions, a male and a female, and by the look of it, they seem to be twins.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dThis the first time the twins share a customer, since most aren\u2019t much for incest\u201d, she said to Oberyn, and then turned to me, \u201dYou must that we have rules in this house when it comes to weapons. Your guards are allowed to keep theirs, but the rest of you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dOf course, we\u2019re not that stupid\u201d, I surrendered Excalibur and my dagger to her servants, with Alester doing the same and Oberyn obviously had no weapons.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dNow that\u2019s settled, which girl will you pick?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dThat one over there\u201d, I pointed to the huge breasted squirrel with the pink corset.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dOh dear, you better be careful. That\u2019s Marika, one of the new girls. She came to us more than a month ago, and many of our customers were not able to keep up with her. Her appetite for lovemaking is one of a goddess\u201d, wow.<br>\r\nMe; \u201dIf I can handle Geecku and Zandria, I can handle this Marika\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dI hope so, for your sake\u201d<br>\r\nOberyn Martell; \u201dNow have a taste and let\u2019s begin!\u201d<br>\r\nI took a little piece of fermented crab and put it in my mouth. Didn\u2019t like the taste, but I swallowed it anyway. He assured me that it will make my cock hard for many hours.<br>\r\nMercedes the bunny and Odette the swan came with two human girls with blond hair. Oberyn inspects one, who\u2019s revealed to be a bit frightened by the Red Viper\u2019s presence. \u201dTimid\u201d, said Ellaria, \u201dTimid bores me\u201d. Oberyn inspects the other blond, who appears to be a bit of a mischief, as she slipped off her clothing, which made Ellaria laugh and walked up to her, \u201dNot timid\u201d, she said, \u201dDo you like women?\u201d, Prince Oberyn asked, \u201dWhen they look like her, my lord\u201d, the mischief blond replied, and Ellaria said \u201dThis one will do nicely\u201d. And then a male zebra appeared, \u201dI hear the Red Viper likes to suck cocks\u201d, stand taller than Oberyn, \u201dWhich way do you like it?\u201d, he said confidently, before the Prince grabbed his crotch, making the zebra gasp, and said \u201dMy way\u201d, he turned his head to Chataya, \u201dYou don\u2019t mind if borrow this one?\u201d, \u201dIt\u2019s your money\u201d, replied the Southlander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Oberyn and Ellaria left with their bedwarmers, Chataya signaled Marika (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://static1.e621.net/data/f4/16/f41649c908c379cd414ff9fbc347daaf.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://static1.e621.net/data/f4/16/f416...</a>) to come over. As she was stepping towards us, she\u2019s swaying her hips in a sultry manner while also making sure her giant breasts bounced delightfully in her tight top.<br>\r\nI didn't move as I watched her do this until she was just in front of me. My voice seemed lost as I saw her body move in ways I\u2019d never seen a human woman\u2019s do (I had slept with Dioda a couple of times). Before Chataya said anything, Marika then pressed her breasts against my chest, causing me to grunt from their size and softness, and lifted her arms to rest her paws on my shoulders. This also caused her elbows to push at the sides of her jugs and made the upper slopes of them spill upward and outward of the top, her cavernous cleavage becoming even more pronounced. \u201dHi, Your Majesty, I\u2019m Marika\u201d, she said to me huskily.<br>\r\nMy mind is, understandably, more focused on the voluptuous body of the busty squirrel woman whose arms were resting on my shoulders. I\u2019m still trying to comprehend the sights and sensations I experience from having her breasts pillowing out onto my chest. Marika was also wiggling her hips to make her ass sway from left to right, her tail following along the motions, and causing her half-covered cheeks to jiggle. I knew that if her pink corset weren't on her right now, the cheeks of her assuredly soft rear would be smacking up against each other and making an audible clapping sound.<br>\r\nMy hands rose upward until they were leveled with her wide hips, where they then perched themselves and I pulled her even closer towards me. I watched in awe as I saw the melons on her chest pancake onto my chest, the deep line of her cleavage making me wonder if I would become lost in the cavern if I shoved my face inside. There was only one way to find that out and I knew that Marika would happily let me figure that out.<br>\r\nI looked back up to the gorgeous squirrel girl, whom was delighted at how enamored I am with her body and that I touched her. She then without a warning kissed me right on my lips. I closed my eyes and reached around with my left hand and gave the right cheek of her ass a good squeeze after my palm was filled with the soft and furry flesh.<br>\r\n\u201dMarika\u201d, said Chataya, interrupting us, and we stopped the kissing, \u201dPlease excuse her, but I never saw her being this forward before. And Marika, maybe you could in a more private area?\u201d, I looked around to see everyone starring at us, even my Kingsguard (Adrian and Stephen snickers while Thomas rolled his eyes)! I felt my face go red in embarrassment. Chataya then said \u201dI recommend the turret room, that should give you more privacy\u201d, and with a happy smile, Marika gently grasped my hand and started to lead me up the stairs towards the turret, her wide hips swaying seductively the entire time. I didn't say anything along the way, merely watching the way her ass shook with each step she made in her stride. I\u2019m also amazed that, when I looked up, I saw that I could see the sides of the busty squirrel woman's immense breasts even from behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we reached our destination, after three flights of stairs from the ground floor, down a long hall and up another stair to a lone door which Marika opens to the turret room. I ordered my three Kingsguards to guard at the foot of the stairs, and so they did.<br>\r\nOnce I got into the room and closed the door, I took a better look around. Within the room is a great canopied bed, a tall wardrobe decorated with erotic carvings and a narrow window of leaded glass in a pattern of red and yellow diamonds.<br>\r\n\u201dYou\u2019re going to absolutely love the things we\u2019ll do together, Your Majesty!\u201d, she claimed to me with a sensual smile on her gorgeous face, cupping her huge breasts with her petite hands and bounced them a couple of times in her palms. Miraculously, her shirt didn't tear open by the mammoth-sized mammaries moving around so much. \"You were staring at these a lot, right? Don't you worry... I'll let you do anything you want to them\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dOh my Gods\u201d I murmured as he was transfixed by all of that titflesh rippling and jiggling in front of him. By now, his cock was completely hard and a very prominent bulge was formed. Marika licked her lips at the sight of it\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marika leads me to the bed and told me to take off my clothes before she went behind a changing-screen. I took it all off as fast as I could and sat down on the edge of the bed. And then she appeared again from behind the screen. Compared to Geecku and Zandria, Panthy the priestess, Bruma the seductress, Sheila and Artica the sisters, and Akita the dragoness, this squirrel woman is a goddess. Even without the fermented crab, the sight of her naked body and huge breasts made me harder than I have ever felt in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to me, leaned down, grabbed my head and kisses me hard on my lips and forces her tongue in my mouth, and I kiss her back. While we kept kissing and our tongues danced, she sat down left of me, took my right hand with her left and guided it to her folds.<br>\r\nAs I start rubbing her lower lips she let go off my hand, and instead use her left hand to stroke my shaft, while her right hand is on the back on my head in order to prevent me from pulling from the make out session. As if I would want that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe kept on with kissing, playing with each other\u2019s tongues, and pleasures our nether regions. After using my fingers inside her for a while, she came first. She ended the kissing with a big \u201dMwah!\u201d, took my fingers out, and then sucked and licked them clean.<br>\r\nWhen finished, she laid me down on the center of the bed in a very quick move. Using her left hand to hold me down on my back, she straddle on my lap and uses her right hand to point my shaft upward. \u201dSit back and relax, handsome king\u2026\u201d, she said to me, while I\u2019m more focused on watch her massive breast dangling above me. What a view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a swift motion, she lowered herself, sliding my cock inside her wet pussy until the cheeks of her big, round ass made contact with my swollen balls, and that made her threw her head back and let out a loud moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Oh goddess! I feel so full with your cock! So good!\" This was when she began to bounce herself up and down on my cock, in a slow pace at first to enjoy the felling of 8-inch hard cock in her, but soon enough going faster and faster. \u201dAaaaaawwww fuuuuuck!\" The busty squirrel screamed out as her ass was now bouncing off of my balls with a lewd smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhap! Whap! Whap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh Gods!\u201d I tried to hold onto my wits but I am being sandblasted with so much pleasure that I\u2019m having a hard time thinking of anything but the fact that I\u2019m being given the ride of my life (the others will have a hard competition!).<br>\r\n\u201dYou're so fucking good, Marika!\" I exclaimed as I stared up at her, her face barely visible because of her bouncing breasts.<br>\r\n\"Take that cock! Take it!\" My lust has overtaken me and I am acting a lot more confident now. This was evidenced by me raising my left hand into the air and gave the right cheek of her ass a good, hard smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFuck yes! I love your cock, King Arthur!\" Marika yelled back to me as she kept on bouncing. \"Please let me come over to your castle every day to play with it! I can't get enough of this cock!\" She moves her hips with much more speed. She ran her paws through her hair as I used her legs now to keep herself going up and down, her pussy squeezing around my shaft like a vice. This caused her huge breasts to go bouncing and jiggling wildly.<br>\r\nI quickly grabbed her breasts and started squeezing them with my hands, loving the way her furry flesh poured through my fingers with just the smallest amount of pressure. \"Ugh! Okay! I'll fuck you every day from now on! I\u2019ll even let you live in my castle! Just keep bouncing that thick, fat ass on my balls until I cum!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was able to last for an entire hour staying like this. We never changed positions as Marika was too engrossed with the pleasure she was receiving from my cock. I had fun playing with her huge jugs, roaming my hands all over them as well as pinching and twisting her nipples every now and then. Near the end of the hour, I feel my cock begin to throb madly and that told me that I\u2019m going to come again. After Marika sat down on me one last time, the both of us came at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOooooooooooh mmmmmmyyyyyyy goooooodssss!\" The busty squirrel woman screamed out as her pussy clenched down on my shaft as my seed began to pour right on inside her pussy. This load happened to be the biggest in my life so it had no problem filling her up to the brim, my seed soon leaking out and dripped onto the bed. His balls kept rising upward slightly as he fired rope after rope, making a little mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the both of us rode through our respective orgasms, Marika's upper body fell forward limply. Her breasts squashed onto my chest as she breathed heavily into my right ear. Her breasts feels so fucking good as they\u2019re pillowing outward on my chest. She gave my neck a few soft kisses while she tried to recover, staining me with kiss marks. \"You're such a stud, little brother!\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't replay as we relaxed for now, but I stiffened when I realized what she just said. \u201dLittle brother?\u201d I asked, craned my head up to look at her as she lifted her head with a confusing look that quickly turned into one with mixture of surprised and awkward. \u201dUh\u2026Oops!\u201d was all she was able to say with a awkward smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirms it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds I pushed her off me and I quickly crawled backwards until I have my back against the headboard of the bed. I slept with my sister! Oh dear Gods! I\u2019m breathing madly and my cock won\u2019t go soft, even a little. Damn Oberyn and his fermented crab!<br>\r\nMarika meanwhile looks as if she doesn\u2019t know what to say. The door then knocked and Marika went to open it. Turns out Chataya has sent two girls carrying two trays with food in case we got hungry. They put the trays down on a nearby table and then left without paying attention to what\u2019s happening in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure I\u2019m hungry as hell, but there\u2019s too many questions in my head right now! Marika sat down on one of the chairs, \u201dWe both need to eat\u201d she said to me, \u201dAt least let me explain?\u201d.<br>\r\nI slowly got off of the bed and went and sat on the other chair, and we began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were finished eating, she told me her story\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day before my father, King Edward the Seafarer, left Narnia for home, he spent the last night with Marika\u2019s mother. Just after his ship started sailing away, she realized she was pregnant with Marika without father knowing, not that it mattered anyway.<br>\r\nMarika was born after that, and she was born with the pink streak on her head (a sign meaning she would great love in life and never let it go no matter what), and when she turned 16 she gained the massive-sized breasts she has now, which is very rare among female squirrels as they usually have near-head-sized breasts. Marika become the most popular of squirrels in the next few years and she had mated with several male Furries (even slept with a few kings), but she had never let any to release their seeds inside her.<br>\r\nShe never realized why, until one night she dreamt of a young human wearing a red dragon on his tunic.<br>\r\nThat was a few months ago, and she was determent to have him, so she sailed from Narnia and ended up in the City of Camelot. Getting into the city hiding under a thick coat (not wanting too much attention), she found Chataya\u2019s brothel and decided to take a job there. After seeing the shape of her body and the size of her breasts, Chataya employed her without hesitation.<br>\r\nSometime later, she discretely walked through the city and then she saw me riding to the western gate with a large party (that was when I was heading to Earl Raynald Sarwyck\u2019s funeral).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAnd as soon as I saw your face, I knew were the one from my dream!\u201d she said to me while we were sitting by the table. While I listened to every word she said, I can\u2019t help but think of why I\u2019m not felling scared, panicky or angry, I\u2019m rather feeling both lust and happiness. What is wrong with me?! I committed incest! Why am I feeling differently? Is it because I don\u2019t see her as a sibling? That I see her more like a lover? Is my lust taking over completely?<br>\r\n\u201dI know incest normally applies lions, cows and bunnies, and it\u2019s vile in human eyes, but I can\u2019t help it\u201d, she suddenly straddled me on my lap, her huge breasts pressed against my chest, pillowing outward so much that the upper slopes nearly touches my chin. Her paws are resting on my shoulders and her folds are touching my shaft.<br>\r\nMarika keeps talking, \u201dMy heart has chosen you. I\u2019ll let you do whatever you want with my body\u201d, she starts rubbing my shaft with her folds, her breasts massaging my chest, \u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sin or anything for what we did, or doing\u201d she whispered to my ear, \u201dBesides\u2026 Doesn\u2019t it turn you on? Even a little? I know you love my breasts. You\u2019re the first male I had let claim me by coming inside me, and I\u2019m letting you do anything you want with my breasts. In fact\u2026\u201d, she looks at me deep in the eyes, \u201dAs far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re yours, now and forever!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into her beautiful blue eyes, I suddenly realized that I had fallen for my sister. And by mating with her, there\u2019s no going back from this. Might as well embrace it and accept the consequences.<br>\r\nShe squeal when I all of a sudden rise up from the chair, lifting her up to the table and plunges my shaft into her. \u201dOh, fuck!\u201d She moans very loudly while throwing her head back as I move my hips back and forth, and then she grabs my head with both paws and pull me into the deep valley of her massive cleavage.<br>\r\nI get lost in the feeling of my head between her breasts, and after a minute of enjoying the feeling I began to kiss her breasts from within, with Marika moaning with approval. I kiss all over her right breast until I found her nipple and starts to lick and suck on it while my right hand mauls her left breast. \u201dYes, baby! Suck on those fat tits!\u201d Marika moaned out as I did just that. It\u2019s official, I love huge breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, we came on the table, she pulled me of her cleavage so I could take deep breath, before she pulled me in for a kiss, which I responded with passion.<br>\r\nThen I lead her back to the bed, tell her to get on it on all four, positioned myself and starts mating with her from behind. \u201dFuck! Yes!\u201d Marika moans as I keep a strong hold on her waist as I move fast in her, and her tail is brushing my face. And her tail feels good and it has a very nice smell. And as soon as I finished coming, she flips to her back and now I\u2019m on top of her as we fuck. We look into each other\u2019s eyes for a while until we kiss again with our tongues dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in another part of the brothel, Chataya\u2019s resting her head on Alester Sarwyck\u2019s chest as they rest for a bit.<br>\r\n\u201dYou\u2019re certainly still have talent in pleasuring women\u201d she said, relishing the felling of her old lover in her arms.<br>\r\n\u201dSo it would seem\u201d Alester replied, \u201dAnd I could say the same about you\u201d, they both chuckle.<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dI think Marika will be leaving with King Arthur\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dWhat makes you think that?\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dThis is the first time she behaved like that to anyone. She told me a few times that she would one day find the mate she\u2019s been looking for and leave here. I think she found it in the King\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dIt would be interesting to see what Arthur would think\u201d<br>\r\nChataya; \u201dBut let\u2019s think of that later. Ready?\u201d<br>\r\nAlester Sarwyck; \u201dAlways, My Lady\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChataya simply chuckle as he moves above her and they start again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was starting to set as we kept at it. We\u2019ve been doing it for several hours, going from one position after another.<br>\r\nRight now Marika\u2019s above me, bouncing up and down on my cock and we have our hands locked together. Her breasts are bouncing and jiggling wildly, a beautiful sight to me. We both agree that this is our favorite position. I\u2019m a bit exhausted (just a little) and I\u2019m letting her do all the work. Something she doesn\u2019t mind at all!<br>\r\nFinally she throws her head back and scream in pleasure as we came together for the final time. She falls forward so that her breasts are once again on my chest. I pant heavily while loving the feeling of giant jugs on me. Her head lies next to mine, and we reach out our lips for a few more kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cock is finally going soft, meaning the effects of the fermented crab have stopped, and the shaft moves out of her folds.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m really the only one who has pumped seed inside of you?\u201d I asked her, \u201dYes\u201d she replies, adding another kiss. That got me thinking, and asked \u201dWhat if you get pregnant?\u201d, and she replies \u201dThen our child or children will be born with love\u201d.<br>\r\nChildren born of incest are considered abominations in the eyes of the Gods. But for some reason, I feel like I don\u2019t care what other people would. And I\u2019m starting to like the feeling.<br>\r\n\u201dNo one can know we share the same father, Marika\u201d I whispered to her, \u201dIt has to be our secret\u201d. Marika answered \u201dYour wish is my command, my love\u201d, and she pecked my nose before closing her eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My love</i>. It certainly is going to take a lot of time to get used to from a sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the city, sometime after sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was having the greatest time of my life (a little exaggerating I know), the Council received word that ships with the royal flag of Estalia arrived to port.<br>\r\nSometime after that Lord Herbert, Earl Edwin and Marshal Robert rode down to meet with the entourage which had already disembarked the ships. The three and their guards came to the docks to see Princess Arianne Martell being the leader of the entourage of nobles, knights and servants from the southern kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerbert Turner remembered her as a pudgy and flat-chested young girl at 6, and she would pray to the Gods nightly, hoping that she would be given beauty when she was older. And it would seem that the Gods had granted her that: now a woman in her early twenties, Arianne is buxom and beautiful, with olive skin, large dark eyes and long, thick black hair that falls in ringlets to the middle of her back. She has full lips and big, round ripe breasts. Favoring her mother Arianne is short, standing at 5 foot 2.<br>\r\nAccompanying her is Areo Hotah, Captain of the royal guards, and her cousins, Obara, Nymeria, Tyene, Elia, Obella, Dorea and Loreza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a friendly greeting with Earl Edwin and flirted Lord Herbert (saying he had not aged a day, making him blush), but Sir Robert realized something: the Princess\u2019 cousins are together known as the \u201dSand Snakes\u201d, the bastard daughters of Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper.<br>\r\nWhen he asked her where her uncle was, she simply said that he and his Paramour Ellaria (mother of the four youngest Sand Snakes) arrived earlier, as he\u2019s not a man for welcoming parties, and have probably went to a brothel in the city. Knowing his reputation he takes his fellow council-members (both now worried) and the guards to find him, and Princess Arianne told Hotah and the three eldest Sand Snakes to join them.<br>\r\n\u201dWe must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies\u201d Sir Robert said, \u201dHow do you plan on finding the right brothel?\u201d asked Nymeria with a mischievous smile, which the old knight answered \u201dYou\u2019re famous for fucking half of Narnia. You just arrived at Camelot after weeks at sea, which famous and expensive brothel would you go?\u201d. The glances at each other, nodding in agreement that he's smart.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time the three council men were introduced to the Princess of Estalia, I was still laying on the bed in Chataya\u2019s brothel with Marika. She\u2019s napping on my right side while holding on to me, and I\u2019m petting her head with my right hand. She looks so cute while asleep.<br>\r\nI then began to sing a little, quietly: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dHe rode through the streets of the city<br>\r\nDown from his hill on high<br>\r\nOver the winds and the steps and the cobbles<br>\r\nHe rode to a woman\u2019s sigh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFor she was his secret treasure<br>\r\nShe was his shame and his bliss<br>\r\nAnd a chain and a keep are nothing<br>\r\nCompared to a woman\u2019s kiss\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFor hands of gold are always cold<br>\r\nBut a woman\u2019s hands are warm<br>\r\nFor hands of gold are always cold<br>\r\nBut a woman\u2019s hands are warm\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then feel her move a little, open her eyes and look at me. \u201dWhat a lovely song\u201d she said, before giving me a quick kiss, \u201dIt\u2019s an old song about a steward visiting his mistress in secret\u201d I told her.<br>\r\n\u201dHow long was I asleep?\u201d she asked, pulling herself up to stretch her arms, making her breasts bounce again.<br>\r\n\u201dOnly a few moments\u201d I answered with a chuckle, \u201dOh? (shrugs) Oh well, how about a little bath?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe wash each other off in the bathtub we share.<br>\r\nMarika; \u201dWanna know a secret?\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dDo tell?\u201d<br>\r\nMarika; \u201dChataya told me that inside the empty wardrobe there is a back panel concealing a secret passageway. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence. When the back panel is pushed all the way aside it reveals a metal ladder, the rungs go well below street level, the shaft then opens onto a dark, slanting earthen tunnel. Having come perhaps a distance of three blocks down the earthen tunnel a patron will then emerge through a trapdoor at the back of a nearby stable. I heard that the tunnel was dug for noblemen whose honor would not allow them to enter such a house like this openly\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dInteresting\u201d, I wash her huge breasts, \u201dCan\u2019t believe I have fallen in love with your giant jugs. I was literally lost in there\u201d<br>\r\nMarika; \u201d(moans) They\u2019re yours, My Love, always\u201d, we kiss while touching each other, me on her breasts, her on my crotch, \u201dThe side effect of fermented crab, is that you won\u2019t get wood until tomorrow. Which is a shame, for I would\u2019ve loved to ride you again (moan) and again\u201d<br>\r\nMe; \u201dAs much as I\u2019d like that too, I seriously need to rest and get some sleep\u201d, we both laugh and continue to wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards I put on my clothes while Marika put on her pink corset. I asked her if she liked dressing in pink, and she said she loves the color because of the pink streak in her hair. While she wouldn\u2019t dye her whole hair pink, she loves dressing it. And I certainly don\u2019t mind at all.<br>\r\nFollowed by my Kingsguard, we went down the stairs back to the ground floor. The common room is not the only big room in the brothel, for there\u2019s also a big dining room where both customers and Chataya\u2019s girls eat. That\u2019s where I found Alester, Prince Oberyn and his paramour Ellaria (sitting next to him), and the mercenaries Asher and Beskha. I can\u2019t help but feeling that he\u2019s the the same Red Viper from my dream. The one with the battle on the snow.<br>\r\nAs I sat and joined them, Marika sat herself across my lap, to the amusement of the others except Alester. \u201dThe fermented crab did wonders didn\u2019t it?\u201d Prince Oberyn teasingly asked.<br>\r\n\u201dIt certainly did, Prince Oberyn\u201d I replied.<br>\r\n\u201dPlease, I'm fine with Oberyn\u201d he told me.<br>\r\nI turned to Alester, \u201dHow do you know the Red Viper, Alester?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201dThis is not the first time he visits Albion, Your Majesty\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n\u201dMe and Double-edged Sword have been fighting alongside one another on a few occasions in the past\u201d said Oberyn. So he knows Sir Mors too?<br>\r\nI then turned to the pair of mercenaries, \u201dWhat about you two? How long have you two been doing the profession?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dBeskha here was a mercenary longer than I\u2019ve been\u201d said Asher, \u201dWhile I\u2019ve only been one for four years\u201d<br>\r\nBeskha continued, \u201dHe and his lover was on the run, and they quickly became my friends for life\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m surprised that a mercenary has a happy family life\u201d I told them.<br>\r\nAsher said \u201dLet\u2019s just say that our families doesn\u2019t get along very much and we ran away from all of it and later we got married and we then have little boy\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dShe doesn\u2019t mind you being in a brothel?\u201d I asked him.<br>\r\n\u201d(chuckle) I\u2019m just eating in here. Plus, Gwyn\u2019s the only woman for me\u201d he told me.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd you certainly have no problem with the girls, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Beskha, and women within earshot in the dining room giggled.<br>\r\n\u201dDon\u2019t get me started. I don\u2019t if it\u2019s because of Fae-ancestry or some curse from the Gods, but lustful women seems to be extremely attracted to me since my puberty\u201d I said. And it is true, I became a bit handsome early and the Council did what they could to stop prevent lust filled women to get into my bed. I look at Marika in her eyes \u201dBut it\u2019s not like I\u2019m complaining\u201d, I nuzzle in Marika\u2019s neck, making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI figured something like that would happen sooner or later\u201d said Oberyn. I raised an eyebrow in confusion. \u201dWe\u2019ve met, you and I. Many years ago\u201d he told me.<br>\r\n\u201dI think I would have remembered that\u201d, I told him.<br>\r\n\u201dUnlikely\u201d Said Alester, \u201dYou were just a baby at that time\u201d.<br>\r\nOberyn continued \u201dI was a young boy when I had my first time away from Estalia. Touring through Tilea, Bretonnia, the Empire and finally, Albion. To be honest, I didn\u2019t like much about Albion. Not the food, not the weather, not your accents. Nothing. But still I found few friends here, like Alester. He and I were both interested in the arts of war and quickly formed a friendship. Of course I wasn\u2019t alone, I had Elia with me\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dElia Martell?\u201d I asked. She was the sister of King Doran and a wife of my father\u2019s Lawmaker. All I heard about her was that she died 15 years ago, around the time my parent died and I became king.<br>\r\n\u201dShe was my older sister by one year\u201d he continued \u201d25 years ago, she met this nobleman from Albion, and they fell for each other. I attended their wedding 20 years ago, and your father was there too and met your mother. Elia\u2019s husband later became a Lawmaker in the Council and she stayed with him. 2 years after, she gave birth to their daughter, my niece, Estelle. Your mother and Elia were very good friends. They even talked about you marrying Estelle\u201d, that\u2019s surprising, neither Zandria or Herbert told me that, \u201dI\u2019ve gotta say that there\u2019s only one disappointment that was pleasant\u2026 You\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dMe?\u201d I said, as confused as the rest.<br>\r\n\u201dThe same year Elia\u2019s son, Aaron, was born, I travelled from Estalia to visit Elia and her family, and yours, with my niece, Princess Arianne. Her first time away from Estalia, 6 years old. My brother apparently thought of marrying his own daughter to you, like some kind contest between him and our dear sister. After we arrived at port in the capital, all the way to the castle all anyone talked about was the monster that is being born to the Seafarer\u201d, Herbert told me that mother screamed in pain so loud that everyone thought she would die from it, \u201dA head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed \u201dThat would have made things so much easier\u201d, the others joined in.<br>\r\nOberyn chuckled \u201dTo be honest, I nearly believed it all. I nearly feared that if the girls saw a monster instead of a prince, they would have nightmares for life. When I met your father, he promised he would show us and the rest of the court  to you. Every day I would ask. Every day he would say, \u2019soon\u2019. Then he and your mother assembled the court, everyone gathered\u2026 they unveiled the freak. Your head was of regular size. Your arms and legs too, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. I didn't even try to hide my relief while Arianne and Elia made those sounds a person would make when they see a cute animal. I think they would cuddled you even if your were ugly!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dSorry to disappoint!\u201d I laughed. \u201dSo was there any betrothal for me that day?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly sadness on his face, \u201dYour parents had three offers of betrothals from Elia, Doran and Duke Blackadder, who was still Marshal at the time. Your father wanted to have two years before he and your mother decided. But it never happened. I was still in Estalia when your parents drowned near Marienburg with High Admiral and Elia\u2019s husband. She never got to hear of his fate. Because she was already dead\u2026 she and her children, murdered\u201d, I got shocked hearing that. I never heard of how they died.<br>\r\n\u201dMurdered?\u201d I nervously asked.<br>\r\n\u201dThey were all found in their manse outside the city gates butchered\u201d he said with sadness, \u201dEstelle had 50 stab wounds, little Aaron had his head bashed against the wall, and Elia\u2026 there were signs of her being raped before having her head split open. The council delivered their remains to Estalia\u201d, there was silence in the room, as if everyone had heard it before.<br>\r\nI asked \u201dWas the guilty ones caught?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dNo\u201d he said, \u201dLord Herbert and the Council had searched for months and years, but there was no justice. There were rumors about who killed them\u201d, the sadness disappeared from both face and voice, \u201dThe one I keep hearing is that Commodus Blackadder and his giant Gregor raped Elia and split her in half. When I see him.. I\u2019ll tell him that his family aren\u2019t the only ones who pay their debts\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTO BE CONTINUED</span></div></div>",

I need his armies and fleet in the event that the Norse would attempt to invade Albion. And the last thing I want is to have a vengeful bloodbath! If his heir is the guilty one, the Council and I will find proof of it. Until then, I\u2019m asking you not to kill anyone\u201d.<br>\r\nEllaria of the Sands calms him down whispering soothing words, the Red Viper composure himself and said \u201dYou\u2019re right, Arthur. Let\u2019s change the subject shall we?\u201d, well that was a weird change of mood.<br>\r\n\u201dYes, let\u2019s do that\u201d Said Ellaria, \u201dHave you ever thought of meeting your half-siblings in Narnia?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at Marika for a second before saying \u201dActually, I have a half sister on visit in the Maidenvault. Her name is Kairel and she\u2019s a princess of Dolandis\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dRihanna\u2019s daughter?\u201d Oberyn asked, \u201dHer mother is a real wildcat, while Kairel is heavily influenced by a nun\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, she told me that\u201d I said, \u201dFortunately for me, she\u2019s not interested in incest\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dNeither are Oberyn and I, at least until my daughters are of age\u201d Ellaria said, \u201dBut Kairel didn\u2019t come to Albion alone didn\u2019t she?\u201d.<br>\r\nI sigh \u201dNo. There\u2019s a panther priestess named Panthy and a princess from Heidi named Bruma, both are not my siblings\u201d.<br>\r\nOberyn laughed \u201dBruma?! The seductress of lions is here? I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about her. She\u2019s been looking for a worthy male to impregnate her\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dI think she succeeded with me\u201d I replied and Oberyn laugh with the others, even two of my Kingsguards, Adrian and Stephen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dStill\u201d Beskha said, \u201dAren\u2019t you even a little curious about doing some furry incest?\u201d.<br>\r\nI would have said that I already did with Marika, but instead I said \u201dA little, but the Old Gods and the New are against incest. Cousins are the only exceptions\u201d.<br>\r\nThen Asher said \u201dHeh, there has been a big schism in the Faith about incest between humans, Furries and Fae\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\nOberyn said \u201dThe High Priest and every priest in the Faith have been debating about it, ever since a young priest noted that the holy writings doesn\u2019t say anything about being against incest with furries and Fae. The debates have been going on for months, and are all about whether or not humans will be allowed to do incest with furries and Fae in Middle Earth\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dThere\u2019s even been talks about encouraging noble humans marrying Furries and Fae of noble or royal blood, even if any of the two races perform incest\u201d Ellaria said.<br>\r\nWell, this conversation is getting a lot more interesting. But what will the kings and nobles in Middle Earth think of it? More importantly for me, what will the nobles of Albion think of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Asher and his companion, \u201dWhat are you two doing here in Albion in the same ship as the Red Viper?\u201d I asked them.<br>\r\nAsher seems reluctant before saying \u201dWell\u2026 I have some unfinished business to deal with here, you could say\u201d.<br>\r\nI got suspicious and asked \u201dWho are you, really?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I hear the familiar voice of my Marshal, Sir Robert, \u201dPrince Oberyn Martell!\u201d I hear him shout, I look over the table and sees him with Lord Herbert and Earl Edwin at the entrance on the other side of the dining room. Their guards must waiting outside the brothel. They walk towards us, and they\u2019re accompanied by a bearded man wearing chainmail and carrying a long-axe and three female furries, each a different species.<br>\r\n\u201dSir Robert! Never thought I\u2019d see you in a place like this!\u201d, said Oberyn.<br>\r\n\u201dOh shut up\u201d said the Marshal, \u201dI\u2019m trying to make sure you don\u2019t cause trouble\u201d.<br>\r\nOberyn ignored the last part and turned his attention to the man and the furries, and says in Estalian \u201d(Has the trip been good, Areo?)\u201d, the man answered in the same tongue \u201d(Good enough. And I see you have found the king)\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201d(Indeed I have)\u201d, Oberyn replied before turning back to me, \u201dThis is Areo Hotah, the captain of my brother Doran\u2019s guard, and these three are my daughters\u201d.<br>\r\nAh, now I see. They are the eldest of the infamous Sand Snakes, bastard daughters of the Red Viper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe introduced them one at the time:<br>\r\n\u2014 Obara is a big-boned and long-legged horse with black fur and rat-brown mane and tail (tied in a knot). She\u2019s wearing a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun and gold over brown riding leathers and wields a spear and a round shield. She\u2019s flat-chested, which is extremely rare among furries.<br>\r\n\u2014 Nymeria, nicknamed Lady Nym, is a slender leopard with straight black hair worn in a long braid. On her hip is a whip, and several knives. She's got the big breasts and beauty that her elder sister Obara lacks, but knowing her father\u2019s reputation, she is no less deadly.<br>\r\n\u2014 Tyene is a fair mouse with white fur and golden hair, dimples bloom in her fur-cheeks. She\u2019s wearing a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Tilean lace. Despite being shorter and younger than Nymeria, her breasts are bigger and her hips are wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObara looks at my face and says, \u201dthe King looks older than he looks\u201d, I chuckled in response.<br>\r\n\u201dWhere did you receive such horrible scars on your handsome face?\u201d, Tyene asked while taking a closer look and giving an eyeful of cleavage, which doesn\u2019t seem to bother Marika. \u201dFrom a Dragon-kin\u201d, I replied.<br>\r\n\u201dYou kidding?\u201d, Oberyn asked, while Ellaria, Asher, Beskha and the Sand Snakes looks at me very surprised.<br>\r\nAlester says, \u201dHe\u2019s not\u201d, and Asher asks, \u201dOh, you gotta tell us!\u201d, but Herbert interrupts, \u201dI'm afraid His Majesty needs to go back to the castle\u201d.<br>\r\nHe\u2019s right, it\u2019s time to go home. But I\u2019m taking Marika with me. All this talk about furries and Fae made me decide to love and have children with her, even when I\u2019m married with Rose Blackadder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just before I\u2019m about to get Marika off my lap and stand up, I notice Sir Robert look at Asher, who in turn looks a bit uncomfortable while having elbow on the table, forehead on his palm and eyes looking down.<br>\r\nThen my marshal says, \u201dAsher?\u201d.<br>\r\nWait, what?<br>\r\nHe knows this mercenary?<br>\r\nBeskha says, \u201dUh\u2026 what?\u201d, she\u2019s as confused as most of us. All my council members seem to recognize him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly we hear from across the dining room, \u201dAsher!\u201d. Heading towards us is Sir Mors Westford and a middle aged man in leather clothing. I recognize that man as Sir Malcolm Branfield,  a knight who\u2019s Duke Gregor Forrester\u2019s brother-in-law (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ttgot/images/c/c2/MalcolmPortrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20190408022130\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ttgo...</a>). He was traveling around Albion a few years ago and passed through Camelot. I talked with him before he went on the next day.<br>\r\nAsher reluctantly stood up before Sir Malcolm got him into a strong hug and shouted, \u201dIt really is you!\u201d. Beskha asked out loud, \u201dAsher\u2026 Who the fuck is he?\u201d, and Asher replied, \u201dMy uncle\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when I understood. He\u2019s Asher Forrester, Gregor\u2019s second son who went missing four years ago!<br>\r\n\u201dWhere have you been all these years?! When Mors here told me that he saw you going in here, I couldn\u2019t believe it! Do you have any idea how worried everyone has been?!\u201d, Malcolm kept asking.<br>\r\nAsher then had enough, \u201dUncle, take it easy!\u201d, Malcolm calmed down a little, \u201dLook, I\u2019m sorry. But it\u2019s complicated\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dHow so?\u201d, I asked, \u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with getting married and not telling your family?\u201d, and as soon as everyone turned to me, I immediately cursed myself.<br>\r\nMalcolm looked confused, \u201dHe\u2026 What?\u201d, he turned back to Asher, who was groaning.<br>\r\nBefore anyone said anything, Gwyn suddenly turned up beside Asher, startling us a little. \u201dAsher, it\u2019s time to get back our temporary quarters\u201d, she said while taking his right arm, before turning her head towards Malcolm, who looks shocked, and asks her husband, \u201dWho is this?\u201d.<br>\r\nHe replies, \u201dUncle Malcolm\u201d, and Gwyn looks at Sir Malcolm surprised and says, \u201dOh, this is earlier than unexpected. How\u2026?\u201d.<br>\r\nSir Mors says, \u201dMy wife just started working at the inn across the street\u201d, right, the Westfords are known for working hard to earning their incomes, \u201dWhen I was checking in how she was doing, I saw Asher here walking out and enter here. I knew Sir Malcolm arrived this morning and is staying at an inn, so I went for him. I thought this youngster was bedding whores again, but didn\u2019t expect him to settle down\u201d, and he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Malcolm then says, \u201dFour years without a word, and you never thought of mentioning this? Why?\u201d.<br>\r\nAsher and Gwyn seems very nervous and started to fumble with words.<br>\r\nBut then we all hear something outside the dining room.<br>\r\nIt sound men shouting, women yelling and furnishers falling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the doors bursts open, and several armed men entered. The uniform they're wearing is a mixture of blue and purple with a helmet, and lots of spots to hold weaponry, including two sheaths on their backs for swords and three sheaths for daggers at their left side.<br>\r\nI heard tales about them. They are the Lost Legion, a Tilean mercenary company who\u2019s members are younger sons of aristocratic and merchant families that set out to seek their fortunes as mercenaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man who seems to be of high rank, shouts out, \u201dWhere is Asher Forrester!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2026?</span></div></div>",

Chataya, who was sitting by a table close to ours with Falena and Mhaegan (who is holding her little Barra, who\u2019s crying from all the commotion) with their lovers, Gawen Sarwyck and Aaron Price, respectively, stood and shouted, \u201dWhat is the meaning of this?! What makes you think you can just barge in here and\u2026\u201d, only to be interrupted by their leader who said, \u201dOrders\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhose orders?!\u201d, Chataya asked.<br>\r\n\u201dSomeone who doesn\u2019t care what a whore thinks\u201d, he rudely replied, before turning his attention towards our table. His men were forcing most whores and clients out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we all stood up, with my kingsguard readily gripping their swords, I quietly told Marika to go to Chataya\u2019s table, and she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOberyn says, \u201dWell, if it isn\u2019t Tazal? Never thought I\u2019d see you outside of Tilea. And what do you want with our friend here?\u201d, he places a hand on Asher\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201dHow do you two know this one?\u201d, I asked them.<br>\r\n\u201dWe met a few times\u201d, the Red Viper replied.<br>\r\n\u201dIn our last meeting, you told me and Beskha that you would cut our throats if you ever saw us again\u201d, Asher said to the mercenary named Tazal, \u201dAnd why are here of all places? Tired of waiting to kill us?\u201d.<br>\r\nTazal then says, \u201dNormally, I would never set foot outside my beautiful homeland. But, I\u2019m not going cut your fucking throats\u2026 not yet, anyway\u201d, he points at Asher, \u201dMy employer has a few things to settle with you first\u201d.<br>\r\nWe then hear Beskha say, \u201dAnd who would that be? Some idiot who didn\u2019t like how we guarded him? I\u2019ll have you know that we have good reputation as bodyguards\u201d, and she chuckles.<br>\r\nTazal laughs and says, \u201dWe are nothing like you. The Lost Legion are the blood of Tilea. And we are done taking orders from whimpering pigs\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThen, who is it?\u201d, Asher asks.<br>\r\n \u201dSomeone you shouldn\u2019t have pissed off\u201d, Tazal replied.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat happened to the guards outside?\u201d, Sir Robert angrily asked. A look on Tazal\u2019s face was enough to know the guards are dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we hear several heavy footsteps coming. What enters the dinning room are half a dozen men wearing plate armour. They look like knights of Bretonnia. The only one who\u2019s not wearing a helmet appears to be their leader, and he has a trident on his blue tunic.<br>\r\nGwyn shouts, \u201dYou?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThe fuck are you doing here?!\u201d, Asher shouts out.<br>\r\nI instantly recognize his face from a drawing my court received from Bretonnia. That\u2019s Hugo d\u2019Bordeleaux, second son of mighty Duke Alberic of Bordeleaux. A talented knight with a superiority complex. He was disinherited months ago for, repeatedly, acting dishonorably towards a vassal\u2019s wife, and no word of him since.<br>\r\nWhat is he doing here? And how does Asher and Gwyn know him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo simply said, \u201dGwyn Whitehill, my love, I have come to free you from that pagan\u2019s clutches\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?\u201d, I said and we all looked at the couple.<br>\r\n\u201dWhitehill?!\u201d, Sir Malcolm asks out loud.<br>\r\nThey both ignored us and Gwyn angrily shouts, \u201dHow many times do I have to tell you, this \u201dpagan\u201d is my husband, I love him, and I want nothing to do with you, you idiot!\u201d, she strengthens her hold of Asher\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd how the devils and fuck did you find us?!\u201d, he angrily asks before turning to Tazal, \u201dAnd why do you work for this idiot?! He\u2019s not Tilean and has not enough money!\u201d.<br>\r\nTazal replied, \u201dHe and I made a bet turned contract. If he defeated our captain, the Lost Legion would follow him without question\u201d, he confidently smirked, \u201dWell, the result is that I\u2019m the new captain, and killing you and Beskha is just a bonus. And as for how we found you? When our fleet arrived at the Estalian port you and the Red Viper were in, we figured out your intent to sail to Albion\u2019s capital. We sailed a day ahead, and when your ship passed a Bretonnian port we were at, we quietly followed it from afar\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard enough and asked Hugo, \u201dAnd why are you after Gwyn? As far as I can see, she has no interest in you\u201d.<br>\r\nHugo looked at me and asked, \u201dAnd who gave you permission to speak to me?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dMyself. Because I am Arthur XV Pendragon, King of Albion. Now please answer\u201d.<br>\r\nHe stayed silent for a few moments before replying, \u201dShe\u2019s my betrothed. I have known her since we were children, when our fathers sealed the betrothal. I loved her because she\u2019s not like any lady in fair Bretonnia. And she disappeared four years ago. When I came to Tilea a month ago, I found her prisoned by him\u201d, he pointed at Asher, \u201dNow I must free her from the pagan\u2019s control\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dDid you not hear me?!\u201d, Gwyn screamed.<br>\r\nI chuckled and said, \u201dYou must be more stupid than your father mentioned, when he disinherited you\u201d.<br>\r\nHe glared at me, \u201dFather did no such thing\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dReally?\u201d, I asked skeptically, \u201dBecause according to the letter he sent to every court neighboring Bretonnia\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dLies made by cowards trying to undermine me and prevent from gaining my inheritance\u201d, he interrupted.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat inheritance?\u201d, Alester asked.<br>\r\n\u201dWhy, Bordeleaux of course\u201d, Hugo answered. Me and everyone at the tables (except Herbert, Edwin and Chataya) laughs upon hearing that. \u201dWhat\u2019s so funny?!\u201d, he demanded.<br>\r\nWhile still laughing, I told him, \u201dYou\u2019re a second son, you fool! It\u2019s you older brother, Frermund, who\u2019s the next Duke of\u2026\u201d, then Hugo interrupted me again, \u201dHe\u2019s a weakling unworthy the lands of mighty Bordeleaux. Father knows it, and therefore plans to get rid of him, so stop with the lies!\u201d.<br>\r\nBy the Gods, how delusional can you possibly be?! \u201dWhat lies?! The letter about you was written by your father\u2019s hand, and Gwyn here doesn\u2019t want you!\u201d, I annoyingly told him.<br>\r\nThat resulted him shouting back at me, \u201dInstead of needling and reading poetry, Gwyn took up knife fighting and perfected it, like she was the goddess Myrmidia herself! We are destined to be together, and nothing will stop me from saving her from the pagan\u2019s corruption, and no one will stop me, not even you, peasants!\u201d, his screams resulted Aaron and Mhaegan\u2019s baby to cry out-loud.<br>\r\nHe turned to their table and screamed, \u201dShut that infant up, or I swear I will\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dWhat is the meaning of this?!\u201d, someone called out from the doors, revealing Sir Mors\u2019 wife, Cerenna, being held on her arms and escorted by two of Tazal\u2019s men towards Hugo.<br>\r\n\u201dCerenna!\u201d, Sir Mors yelled and was about to run to her, but Earl Alester and Earl Edwin stopped him, not wanting escalate things further.<br>\r\n\u201dWho is this?\u201d, Hugo asked.<br>\r\n\u201dShe\u2019s my wife, Cerenna Westford!\u201d, Sir Mors answered before turning to her, \u201dWhat are you doing?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThese brutes are wreaking up the inn\u201d, she told him before facing Hugo, \u201dWhat makes you think you can just come here and do as you please?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd why did you call us peasants? It\u2019s obvious that we\u2019re king, knights and nobility, isn\u2019t it?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\n\u201dYou are all runaway peasants that rightfully belongs to Bretonnia\u201d, Hugo replied.<br>\r\nSir Robert says, \u201dWho told you that shit?! Arthur descends from a long line of kings that pulled Excalibur from the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dAll lies!\u201d, Hugo shouted, \u201dLies made by you filthy peasants!\u201d. What the hell is wrong with this guy?! Is he crazy?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe signaled for Cerenna to be released, she then walked to her husband and hugged him.<br>\r\n\u201dCome with me, my love\u201d, Hugo told Gwyn, \u201dTogether, we will rule Bretonnia and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dShut up!\u201d, Gwyn screamed, \u201dJust leave me alone and never come back! I love Asher, we are starting a family and I will not have you ruining it!\u201d, everyone looks at her as she took Asher\u2019s hand and placed it on her belly.<br>\r\nAsher confusingly asked her, \u201dW-w-what?\u201d, and she replied, \u201dI found out this morning on the ship, with Ellaria\u2019s help\u201d, then she turned to Hugo, who had shock on his face, \u201dNow get the fuck out of here, idiot\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo just stood there, not even blinking. Then he slowly started reaching for his sword, and says, \u201dHe planted his corruption in you\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?\u201d, I asked. Everyone else but Asher and Gwyn are equally equally confused. What is he planning?<br>\r\nAfter reaching his sword he starts to pull it out, forcing Sir Robert, my Kingsguard, Obara, Nymeria and Areo Hotah to draw their weapons.<br>\r\n\u201dI must free you from it\u201d, Hugo talks as he pulls out the sword, \u201dI must free you it now\u201d, and he starts to move slowly. I\u2019m getting a bad feeling as I realized what he\u2019s thinking of doing.<br>\r\nLord Herbert then steps out in front of us and spreads his arms out, \u201dWait!\u201d, he says.<br>\r\n\u201dHerbert, what are you doing?!\u201d, I asked him, worried for his safety.<br>\r\nHe turned his head and told me, \u201dLet me handle this, trust me, Arthur\u201d, he then turned back to Hugo and says, \u201dDoing that will only kill her. You do realize that?\u201d, Hugo stays silent and Herbert continues, \u201dWe have soldiers of the Royal Army waiting outside the city wall, once they hear what\u2019s happening, they will have no choice but to kill you for killing our guards, unless our king here says so. If all of you leave the city right now, Arthur will hold the army off your backs. There\u2019s no need for bloodshed, so\u2026\u201d, suddenly he went silent, and looks down at the blade that\u2019s piercing through his gut.<br>\r\nI just stood there, I couldn\u2019t move or speak. The same with everyone else. But Hugo, he\u2019s standing there with wide eyes and gritting teeth while holding the sword, and then he said, \u201dStop talking, peasant\u201d, before pushing Herbert off the sword towards me\u2026</span></div></div>",

Fearing for her child, who\u2019s being held by Chataya, Mhaegan ran towards him, who stabbed her between the breasts. Aaron cried out her name as he caught her.<br>\r\nCerenna then took Mors\u2019 knife and launched herself towards Hugo, who simply grabbed the wrist of her knife hand, before he stabbed her through her too. When he pulled out, Mors punched him in the face so hard that he fell backwards to Tazal, and fighting broke out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others fought Tazal\u2019s men as he and Hugo\u2019s knights dragged him out of the room. Me, sir Robert and Earl Edwin stayed by Herbert Turner, as Mors did with Cerenna, and Aaron did with Mhaegan along Gawen, Falena, Chataya and Marika. Gwyn, Ellaria and Tyene stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held onto Herbert and put pressure on his wound, attempting to stop the bleeding, but it\u2019s too much. \u201dHold on, Herbert\u201d, I keep telling him, \u201dJust hold on, we can get through this, you can\u2019t die\u2026 I need you!\u201d, he has been a father to me since my birth-father died while I was still an infant, he was always there for me, if he was to die, I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026<br>\r\n\u201dNo\u201d, Lord Herbert whispered, \u201dYou were always meant to outlive me\u2026 we both knew that\u2026 You have to be strong\u2026 for the realm, for the people\u2026\u201d, he slowly reached his hand for his neck.<br>\r\n\u201dMy love\u2026 kill them\u2026 kill those bastards\u2026\u201d, Cerenna said her last words to her husband.<br>\r\nI hear Aaron say to his beloved, \u201dI love you too\u2026 I\u2019ll treasure her\u2026 I promise\u2026\u201d, he held onto and cried over the now dead body of his love.<br>\r\nI look back down at Herbert, who is holding onto something that looks like a key tide on a string around his neck, \u201dTake it, Arthur\u2026\u201d, he whispered again, \u201dGet to\u2026 Get to my quarters\u2026 The world depends\u2026 Depends on it\u2026\u201d, and the last words were, \u201dI\u2026 have\u2026 always\u2026 been\u2026 proud\u2026 of\u2026 you\u2026\u201d, and he closed his eyes, forever\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNo\u2026\u201d, I whispered, repeating it louder and louder, shacking his body like trying to wake him up. I felt a hand on my shoulder, \u201dGET OFF ME!\u201d, I screamed out at sir Thomas, who just looked at me before turning his gaze around the room. I did too, seeing the dead bodies of the members of Lost Legion spread around the floor.<br>\r\nAlthough Alester Sarwyck, Oberyn Martell, Asher Forrester and Beskha were unarmed, they were obviously fast and good at hand-to-hand combat.<br>\r\nObara pulled out her spear off a dead Lost Legion, and eyed on me holding Herbert. Everyone quickly regrouped by the tables, watching the dead with sorrow on their faces.<br>\r\n\u201dWhy did he do that?\u201d, Marika whispered with fear and sadness, having never witnessed these sort of events before in her whole life.<br>\r\nOberyn, the Red Viper, says, \u201dIn all my years\u2026 I have never witnessed such madness!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dHe wasn\u2019t this fucking crazy back in Tilea!\u201d, Asher said while comforting Gwyn.<br>\r\nBeskha says, \u201dFucking lunatic with a small fucking army!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dHe seriously believed that cutting babies out would do any good?!\u201d, Edwin says in utter disbelief, \u201dAnd why killing Herbert\u2026?! Doesn\u2019t he realize the consequences of what he has done?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d, Mors asked as he rose up from the floor, \u201dHe has lost his grip on reality. There will be nothing to save him\u2026 He needs to be stopped\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dNo\u2026\u201d, I said as I got up and walked out of the dining room, \u201dHe needs to die\u201d. I will not rest until justice is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe collected and readied our weapons. As Aaron was putting on his chainmail-shirt, Chataya, still carrying Barra, told him, \u201dKill all of them for what they\u2019ve done. None of them deserves to live\u201d, and Aaron replied, \u201dThey will die tonight. I swear it\u201d, and he kissed the forehead of his daughter.<br>\r\nMors loaned out his longsword to Oberyn while keeping the greatsword. \u201dIs this forged by elves?\u201d, Oberyn asked him, \u201dLong story\u201d, the scarred knight answered.<br>\r\nFalena asks Gawen to be careful, and he replies that, no matter what happens, she will have a place in the Sarwyck household, with Alester saying that he\u2019ll make sure of it.<br>\r\nAsher and Gwyn were hugging each other, with Gwyn saying, \u201dIf you don\u2019t come back, I\u2019ll kill you\u201d, Asher laughingly replies, \u201dThen you\u2019ll have to get in line\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Marika, who stood next to me, and said, \u201dI\u2019m truly sorry you have to see all that, Marika\u201d, she simply places her paws on each side of my head and says, \u201dMother warned me things like this could happen often in this side of the world. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get over it\u201d, she then connects her lips with yours, which lasted a few seconds before she pulls away, \u201dStay here with the others, where you\u2019re safe\u201d, I told her, \u201dBe safe, little brother\u201d, she replied, before cursing herself for the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarika followed Chataya upstairs along with Gwyn, Ellaria and Tyene. Earl Edwin Rainheart, royal chancellor, was about to join them, before he turns to me and asks, \u201d\u2019little brother\u2019?\u201d. Even though everyone was getting ready, it was obvious that they all heard her.<br>\r\n\u201dYeah\u201d, I replied. There was no sign of shock, anger or disgust everyone\u2019s faces, like they don\u2019t care that I did it with a sister.<br>\r\nEdwin placed a hand on my shoulder and says, \u201dPerforming incest with furries is inevitable, even traditionalists like me have to accept that. We\u2019ll talk about it at the castle tomorrow, along with a message from the High priest and his Conclave\u201d, and he walks towards the stairs. \u201dI may not be much of a fighter, but I\u2019ll help protecting them\u201d, he says while walking up the stairs.<br>\r\nI turned to the others, \u201dEveryone ready?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\n\u201dThis will be my first real battle\u201d, Obara replied while gripping her spear, \u201dMine too\u201d, says Lady Nym, holding her whip in right paw and a knife on left.<br>\r\nOberyn asks Areo Hotah, \u201dReady to put your axe to work?\u201d, to which the captain of his brother\u2019s guard replies, \u201dAlways, Prince Oberyn\u201d.<br>\r\nAsher twirls two axes he has on each hand.<br>\r\nSir Robert Wolfsbane, my marshal, says while gripping the hilt, \u201dIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been in a fight, so\u2026 Apologies for what you\u2019re about to see\u201d, and he draws his sword, with me, my Kingsguard, Earl Alester Sarwyck, sir Mors Westford, Prince Oberyn Martell \u201dthe Red Viper\u201d, Sir Aaron Price, Gawen Sarwyck, Sir Malcolm Branfield and Beskha doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dLet\u2019s do this\u201d, I said, before signaling two of my Kingsguards, sir Thomas Marshall and sir Adrian Connor, to go out first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they went trough the doors and starting to cut down some of the Lost Legion, the rest of us followed out to the street.<br>\r\nThen I get to see on the right my other guards, sir John Connor, Legolas the wood elf and Gimli the dwarf, also fighting the Lost legion, not resting in the castle, and they\u2019re not alone.<br>\r\nAlongside them there\u2019s sir Duncan the Tall and his knife-wielding squire Egg, and then there\u2019s three identical knights.<br>\r\nThey look identical in appearance, could be brothers, but I could tell them apart by their hairstyle and clothing; the each have a colored tunic, red, blue, and green, over their chainmail and they have different lengths of ginger red hair: red with short hair, blue with medium hair, and green with long hair.<br>\r\nWhat caught my interest is what\u2019s on their tunics; on the front of each tunic, there\u2019s a head of a lion surrounded by stars. That\u2019s what I saw in my dreams!<br>\r\nI also noticed that while the red and the green fought with longswords and shields, the blue fought with a greatsword with which he cut the mercenaries with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left I see the rest of the Lost Legion, Tazal, Hugo and his knights lining up several feet away. Gimli showed up next to me and asked, \u201dWhat happened in there?!\u201d, I didn\u2019t want to answered to that right away, instead I asked him, \u201dWhere did you guys come from?\u201d, and he replied, \u201dOh, an old friend of mine, a dwarf from the Grey Mountains, had opened a tavern just down the street, and we met Dunk and his little friend there. Then we hear that these Tilean bastards are harassing people outside the brothel you were in, so we decided to teach them a lesson. Hehe\u201d.<br>\r\nThen the three brothers turned up close to us, \u201dWho are these three?\u201d, I asked Gimli.<br>\r\n\u201dNo idea, they just joined in on the fun\u201d, the dwarf replied.<br>\r\nThe redhead with the blue tunic says with a Morien accent, \u201dWe are the Lionstar-brothers!\u201d.<br>\r\nThe one in red then says, \u201dI\u2019m sir Alvin, this is sir Robin\u201d, he gestures at the one in blue, \u201dAnd this is sir Martin\u201d, he gestures at he one in green.<br>\r\n\u201dTriplets?\u201d, I asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\u201dYes\u201d, sir Alvin answered.<br>\r\n\u201dMorien? You do have the accent\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dMother and father were\u201d<br>\r\nJohn came up and asked, \u201dWhat the bloody hell is going on here?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019re dealing with an insane son of the Duke of Bordeleaux, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on!\u201d, I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the fight outside the doors were over, we started lining up with old and new allies, facing the other bastards.</span></div></div>",

So he, reluctantly, went inside Chataya\u2019s brothel to joined the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rest of us, we\u2019re now facing the mad Hugo and his mixed mongrels of Bretonnian knights and Tilean mercenaries.<br>\r\nHis knights are dressed in full suits of steel plate armour and are armed with swords, maces, poleaxes and shields.<br>\r\nLost Legion, on the other hand, wears iron helmets (that shows only their eyes and mouths) and leather armour, and have many weapons like crossbows, spears, swords and dagger. Several of them even have dual wielding weapons.<br>\r\nAnd if what Asher and Beskha said is true, then there are still at least 50 men of the Lost Legion and more than 30 Bretonnian knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears that ordinary people had long fled indoors. As for people from the tavern that was facing the brothel? A lot of them were still inside, while a few are on their knees with their backs facing the enemy, as hostages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo has the face of someone completely insane, wide eyed and jaw clenching, and his broken nose from Mors\u2019 fist is bleeding. And he\u2019s holding a young woman\u2019s hair and has his sword near her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind us I hear a lot of steps. I turn my head and see Gold Cloaks, men of the City Watch, marching towards us and led by their commander, Janos Slynt.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat took you so long?\u201d, I asked him when he arrived, \u201dAnd how did these ruffians get in my city?!\u201d.<br>\r\nWhile Gold Cloaks with shield got in front of us, he replied, \u201dThe captain in charge of the gate facing the docks tried to stop them, but they all just walked through them and even dropped a large bag of Silver Shillings at his feet. Like they think they owned the whole place!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dWhere are the soldiers of the Royal Army?\u201d, I demanded to know.<br>\r\n\u201dThey\u2019re coming\u201d, he answered, \u201dI have more men on the other side of these ruffians. We stand with you, Your Majesty\u201d.<br>\r\nJudging from some of them looking far behind them, he\u2019s probably right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlynt stood by me and shouted, \u201dIf you wishes to live, lay down your arms immediately! Or face the City\u2019s justice!\u201d.<br>\r\nNot one appears to comply.<br>\r\n\u201dDo you all wanna die here?!\u201d, I yelled at them, \u201dAre you all going to obey this maniac over a woman?!\u201d.<br>\r\nOne of Hugo\u2019s knights said, \u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter. We had sworn an oath, and we\u2019re not oath breakers\u201d.<br>\r\nI said loudly, \u201dHe has disgraced himself by killing my Royal Steward and two innocent women! He\u2019s bringing dishonor to Bretonnia!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter, an oath is an oath!\u201d, the knight replied. By Gods! Are all those knights as insane as Hugo?!<br>\r\n\u201dEnough with the lies, peasant, and give me Gwyn!\u201d, Hugo yelled out.<br>\r\nI yelled back, \u201dIf anyone\u2019s lying it\u2019s you, to yourself! I am the last descendent of the first KING ARTHUR!\u201d.<br>\r\nHe responded by slitting the young woman\u2019s throat and dropped her on the ground.<br>\r\n\u201dNO!\u201d, said Sir John.<br>\r\n\u201dBASTARD!\u201d, said Sir Mors.<br>\r\n\u201dWHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!\u201d, said Earl Alester.<br>\r\n\"WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!\", said Sir Malcolm Branfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo then took a middle-aged man and said \u201dGive her to me\u201d, before killing him too and dropped him. Repeatedly he says \u201dGive her to me. Give her to me. Give her to me\u2026\u201d, like he was trying to perform a spell of some kind.<br>\r\nAs he was nearing an old man, who I recognized as Old Ren, the everyone around me were shouting at him. Wether they were cursing him and tried to make him see reason, Hugo didn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\nOld Ren begged for mercy and pleaded us for help, but Hugo just plunged his sword through his frail body.<br>\r\n\u201dSlynt! Prepare to attack!\u201d, I shouted. It has to end now.<br>\r\nJanos Slynt ordered crossbowmen forward behind the ones with spears and shields, ready to fire.<br>\r\nAt the same time, Hugo took a little girl, about 7 or 8 years old, and held her arm despited her crying and trying to get off of him.<br>\r\n\u201dWHY?!\u201d, I screamed, \u201dWHY DID YOU KILL MY STEWARD? WHY DO YOU KILL THESE PEOPLE? THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE THIS! DO YOU NOT SEE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS ONLY MAKING THINGS WORSE FOR YOU!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI love her!\u201d, he responded, \u201dNothing will come between us! She needs to be saved!\u201d, he raises his blade to pierce the little girl, before screaming, \u201dGIVE. HER. TO. ME!!!\u201d<br>\r\nI was just about to order the crossbowmen to fire at him so the girl would be saved\u2026 When all of a sudden, an apple flew at his faces and got smashed to pieces. That made him let go of the little girl in order to wipe the splattered apple off his face.<br>\r\nAnd while Hugo was doing that, and before I could blink, a woman in robes suddenly went to the girl, grabbed her and threw her to other women in robes standing outside the tavern. The little girl looked surprised while a waitress from the tavern took her in her arms and ran inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and everyone on both sides were completely surprised of what we just saw. Who is this woman? Why did she risked her own life to save that girl? And why is she and the other women outside the tavern wearing long grey robes? Are they part of some cult?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hugo had finished wiping off his face, he turned to the woman who I guessed have thrown the apple.<br>\r\nShe had pulled back her hood, revealing that she has a beautiful face with dark hair and blue eyes, and has some type tiara on her head. She couldn\u2019t be another unknown sibling of mine, could she.<br>\r\n\u201dHow dare you!\u201d, Hugo angrily said to her.<br>\r\nIn turn, she said, \u201dThat child was guilty of nothing\u201d, she then gestures to the other hostages, \u201dThese people have done nothing to you to deserve death! What is the matter with you?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThis has nothing to do with you, harlot!\u201d, Hugo yelled at her.<br>\r\n\u201dIf my brother\u2019s subjects are in danger, it has to do with me\u201d, she calmly replied.<br>\r\nYep, that settles it. She\u2019s an unknown sister of mine, but from where?<br>\r\nWhile everyone looks at her surprised, I said, \u201dIf you really are my sister, then you better get off the street to safety\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dNo need\u2026\u201d, was all she said before one of Tazal\u2019s men wraps a left arm around her neck and holds his curved short sword in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crossbowmen aimed at them but I held my hand up to prevent them from firing, as I do not wanna risk her life. \u201dThe Lost Legion really has no idea when to quit, huh?\u201d, I asked Tazal who stood at the front.<br>\r\n\u201dWe are the blood of Tilea, and we rather face the God of Death than going down on our knees, begging for mercy\u201d, replied the mercenary leader.<br>\r\nI hear one of the Lionstars, Robin, chuckle and say with Morien-accent, \u201dJudging how your men fought us, your so-called \u201dLegion\u201d is nothing but a few crusty bitches and rag-tag puppies!\u201d, and he laughs.<br>\r\nInstead looking angry and insulted, Tazal and his men of the Lost Legion were confused, murmuring \u201dCrusty?\u201d and \u201dPuppies?\u201d. Seems that they have never heard something like that before.<br>\r\nEven the one holding the dark-haired woman looked confused. And when Robin had finished his laughing, we hear two of the robed woman by the tavern chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou better let go if you don\u2019t want her to break your arm\u201d, one of them said.<br>\r\nStill holding her, he turns and aims his blade at them and says, \u201dShut up, or else I-\u201d, but before he could his sentence, the dark-haired woman grips his sword arm, right hand on the upper and left hand on the lower.<br>\r\nAnd in a blink of an eye, she pushes her left hand and bends the arm, breaking it. The soldier, after a moment of shock, screams out in pain.<br>\r\nAs everyone on both sides were shocked, including me and Hugo, the hostages took the chance and ran off to the inside of the tavern.<br>\r\nNot standing out with the screaming any longer, Tazal grabbed a crossbow from one of his men near him, aimed at the one with broken arm, and silenced him for good.<br>\r\nHe then apparently gives an order to another of his soldiers with armed with a crossbow. Before I could react, he aimed at the woman and fired a bolt\u2026 which then suddenly hit the face of one of Hugo\u2019s knights who had his visor up, the knight then fell on the ground, which made the bolt pierce further upon landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all shocked and confused of what happened. I looked at the woman, who had her left arm raised, showing arm enclosing vambrace made of metal (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dccu/images/6/65/Wonder-woman-gualets-final.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180219022732\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dccu...</a>).<br>\r\nShe deflected the bolt with that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTazal regained his composure and seemingly tells his men with crossbows to fire at her.<br>\r\nBut as they did, she moved so fast that she was like a blur and deflected every single bolt they fired at her!<br>\r\nWe hid behind the shields on our side, even though only two or three bolts hit the shields. And a few of the enemies either got wounded or killed by them.<br>\r\nWhen they were finished, she was on one knee with her back on us, with her right brace in front of her face. I couldn\u2019t see one scratch on them.<br>\r\nShe slowly stood up, and Tazal says, \u201dI don\u2019t believe it\u2026 What are you?\u201d, he seriously couldn\u2019t what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman replies, \u201dA believer\u201d, and when she slightly smashed her braces against each other, there was a bright light\u2026</span></div></div>",

But Hugo angrily remarks, \u201dWhat you are is a bitch using tricks! We knights of Bretonnia are the greatest warriors in the world, and your words are meaningless! Anton, kill that bitch!\u201d.<br>\r\nThe knight called Anton charged at Diana with his poleaxe\u2026 When she suddenly jumps over him just as he\u2019s about to swing it at her.<br>\r\nShe then lands on her feet behind him. Anton just stands still for some reason, \u201dWhat are you waiting for?!\u201d, shouts Hugo, \u201dKill her!\u201d.<br>\r\nSuddenly he falls sideways on the ground\u2026 and his head falls off his shoulders and rolls a bit. She chopped his head whilst in the air?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other knights and the Lost Legion gasped at what they just saw. Hugo orders his knights to attack her at the same time.<br>\r\nBut as they did, she turns out to be too fast as she\u2019s easily dodging and weaving their attacks. She kills them one at the time, cuts through their armor, cut off their limps, and even uses her shield to beat down her opponents and, shockingly, pounces one with the flat-side, sending him flying into a wall!<br>\r\nShe moves like she\u2019s dancing.<br>\r\nAnd then she\u2019s joined by two of the other women who had discarded their robes, revealing themselves to be Amazons as well.<br>\r\nOne has long, ponytailed dark red hair and wields a long greatsword, which easily she cuts a knight in half with.<br>\r\nThe other has short pale blond and wields a weapon on each hand, with which she hits and bashes knights\u2019 helmets with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, all of Hugo\u2019s remaining knights are all dead, leaving Hugo visibly shocked and scared.<br>\r\n\u201dHmph! Calling yourselves \u201dthe greatest warriors in the world\u201d seems very exaggerating\u201d, says the red-haired Amazon.<br>\r\n\u201dCouldn't you have gotten a bigger sword?\u201d, Sir Robin Lionstar asked curiously.<br>\r\nThe red-head cockily replied, \u201dSword? This is but my dagger\u201d, and she chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head to Commander Slynt, \u201dHave your men here stand down and the men on the other side cut down any Lost Legion who tries to escape\u201d, seeing that it will be easy to wipe them out with these Amazons.<br>\r\nAs Slynt did as he was told, me and the others joined up with Diana and her two warriors.<br>\r\n\u201dHugo!\u201d, I shout out, \u201dLost Legion! This is your last chance: lay down your weapons now, or die!\u201d.<br>\r\nThe Lost Legion and their leader replied by standing battle ready. Hugo gripped tightly on his sword, raised it above his head, scream like a madman and charged at us\u2026 only for Diana to use her shield to make him fly through the Legion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the fight starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercenary soldiers kept charging at us. I have to admit, for a group of younger sons of Tilean aristocrats and merchants, they\u2019re really determined to die rather than giving up.<br>\r\nBut we\u2019re determined to kill them all.<br>\r\nOne by one they die at the hands of me, my friends and my allies.<br>\r\nThey all had to pay for what they have done.<br>\r\nAsher and Beskha fought Tazal, while Hugo held against Robert, Mors and Gawen Sarwyck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that despite his apparent madness, he\u2019s a great fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he cut off Sir Robert\u2019s right arm, above the elbow.<br>\r\nThen, the tip of his blade pierced Mors\u2019 left eye and with that distraction, Hugo was about to pierce the blade through his body.<br>\r\nBut just at that moment, Gawen pushed Mors aside and took the blade through him instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNOOO!\u201d, Alester, his older brother screamed out before taking him into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTazal screamed in pain when Asher cut off his right arm. And then Beskha kicked him down before piercing both her blades into his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlester held onto his younger brother. He place the hilt of his sword on Gawen\u2019s chest and whispers, \u201dRest now, Sir Gawen of Riverspring\u201d, knighting him posthumously. Gawen smiles with pride, before closing eyes\u2026 forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo is now all alone. With Tazal, the entire Lost Legion is wiped out and he stands there completely surrounded.<br>\r\nRobert lost his arm and Mors lost his eye, so that leaves me, my Kingsguard, Sir John Connor, Prince Oberyn \u201dthe Red Viper\u201d Martell and two of his bastard daughters, Earl Alester Sarwyck, Sir Duncan the Tall, Sir Aaron Price, Asher Forrester and Beskha, Sir Malcolm Branfield, the Lionstar-brothers, Legolas, Gimli, Diana the Amazon and her two warriors, and the men of City Watch to encircle him.<br>\r\n\u201dYou vile creature\u201d, says Alester with poisonous words, \u201dDeath is too good for you\u201d.<br>\r\nAll Hugo say is, \u201dGive her to me\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYou murdered the man who was like a father to me!\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me\u201d, Hugo says again.<br>\r\n\u201dYou killed Mors\u2019 wife!\u201d, said Oberyn.<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYou killed the mother of my child and the only girl I ever loved!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYou killed my brother!\u201d, Alester says.<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\nI had enough, \u201dGive up already!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dDo you really think we would just do that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dAfter what you\u2019ve done?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dShe never loved you!\u201d, Asher shouted.<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYou are going to die here, do you hear me?!\u201d, I continued.<br>\r\n\u201dGive her to me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dDO YOU HEAR ME?!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo then does a long scream and holds his head with his hand (though his right still clinches his sword), before saying, \u201dSHUT UP! STOP WITH THE LIES! I LOVE HER, SHE LOVES ME, WE ALWAYS HAVE! WHY ARE YOU ALL TRING TO PUT LIES IN MY HEAD?! WHY?!\u201d, he raises his arms in the air, \u201dI AM TAKING HER HOME! AND THEN I AM GOING TO EXTERMINATE YOUR LIE FORE-\u201d, but before he could finish, his right arm was suddenly cut off by my now one-armed marshal, Sir Robert, with one of Adrian\u2019s swords!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seem to go very slowly. Hugo\u2019s arm floating in the air, Hugo looking at where his arm was, and Robert with his angriest expression ever with gritting teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad knight is now on his knees and covered and pressured the stump with his last hand in an attempt to stop bleeding, but didn\u2019t scream in pain like Tazal did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAn arm for an arm, you bastard\u201d, says Sir Robert, who doesn\u2019t seem to care about the pain from losing the arm. He gave back the sword to Adrian, accepted a dead Legion\u2019s belt from a man of the Watch and used it to put pressure on his stump to stop the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped in front of Hugo, \u201dWill you stop now?\u201d, I asked. But Hugo just looks at the ground and whispers, \u201dGive her to me\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it!<br>\r\n\u201dWhat the fuck is wrong with your head?!\u201d, I shouted.<br>\r\nHe suddenly snaps up his head and repeatedly shouts, \u201dGIVE HER TO ME! GIVE HER TO ME! GIVE HER TO ME! GIVE HER TO ME! GIVE HER TO ME!\u201d.<br>\r\nJust before I decided to kill him, Diana takes her rope, which looks like the kind you hang people with, snares his neck and it starts to glow gold.<br>\r\nHugo stops screaming and turns silent. \u201dWhat is this?!\u201d, he asks.<br>\r\n\u201dThis lasso compels you to reveal the truth, and gives pain if you lie or stay silent. Now, why are you here?\u201d.<br>\r\nHugo then starts to cry, \u201dWhy\u2026?\u201d, he whispers, \u201dWhy doesn\u2019t she love me back\u2026? Why did she fall for him\u2026? Why won\u2019t she accept my heart?! Why can\u2019t my father see my greatness?! I defended her from a woman\u2019s vile mouth! Why won\u2019t anyone ACCEPT ME?!!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Hugo finished his sentence, the rain starts to pour down. Well, it helps washing the blood of the street. Hugo, on the other hand, just kept crying his eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd out of nowhere, I hear \u201dYour Majesty!\u201d. And it came from my Court Mage, Selena, who rode down to us, along with Violet, Royal Priestess, my Spy Mistress Zandria and Sir Balian and his men.<br>\r\nSelena and Violet were both disturbed by the carnage before them, while Zandria and Balian were used to it.<br>\r\nEarl Edwin then showed up next to me, and he and I quickly explained what has happened so far to the other Council members.<br>\r\nZandria and Violet both wept tears of hearing about Herbert\u2019s death, and while Selena was saddened by it, she\u2019s also intrigued by Hugo\u2019s madness. She has the ability to see the inside of a insane person\u2019s head and see the cause of their insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile my Court Mage did that, Sir Robert Wolfsbane and Sir Mors Westford were sent to the healers of Goddess Shallya for their injuries. Few of them had studied at the Coven of Magi, which is at the south side of the river.<br>\r\nEarl Alester Sarwyck were watching over his younger brother Gawen\u2019s body. He thought it was a blessing that the rest of the Sarwyck-family stayed behind in Riverspring to stabilize the county, so they wouldn\u2019t have witnessed this bloodbath. He also thought that Gawen wouldn\u2019t have had anyone else than his older brother to knight him.<br>\r\nThe soldiers of the Royal Army was ordered to collect all the dead mercenaries and Hugo\u2019s knights (the families of the knights were to be notified via pigeons) and burn them, but their weapons and armor were to be sent to the royal armory in the castle. When Selena had finished, the City Watch Commander Janos Slynt took Hugo away, while the mad knight screamed out Gwyn\u2019s name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we all gathered in the brothel. I will make sure to promise Chataya that the Crown will pay for the damages done by Hugo and his cronies.<br>\r\n\u201dHugo is indeed in love with you, Lady Gwyn, since you both were children\u201d, Lady Selena said to Gwyn Forrester, \u201dBut he deluded himself believing that you were in love with him too when you two first met.<br>\r\nAnd when you disappeared 4 years ago, he was convinced that you were kidnapped and not ran away as many had thought, and tried to make his father assemble all the knights of the Dukedom of Bordeleaux to search for you. But Duke Alberic refused. After all, Hugo has misbehaved rather than doing \u201dgreatness\u201d as he made himself to think.<br>\r\nAnd the final straw was months ago, when a wife of one of Alberic\u2019s vassals gossiped about you possibly running with a lover, Hugo snapped and repeatedly slapped her face in front of everyone. And so he was disinherited and banned from the castle. <br>\r\nAfter that, he and his likeminded entourage journeyed to Tilea. When he saw you and Asher together, that\u2019s when he became truly mad, believing he had taken you away against your will and corrupted you into his plaything\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat about all that stuff about lies?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\nSelena continued, \u201dBecause he\u2019s so deluded that truth became his enemy\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dSo what\u2019s gonna happen to him now?\u201d, Asher asked.<br>\r\nAlester says, \u201dEven though he killed my brother, I have to say he\u2019s to pathetic to kill after seeing him cry like an infant\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI agree\u201d, I said, \u201dI will let him heal in the temple of Shallya and then put him on the next ship to Bordeleaux and let his father decide his fate\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Balian as his men were placing the bodies of Herbert, Mhaegan, Cerenna and Gawen on stretchers, \u201dPlease, take them to the castle\u201d, I told him, \u201dAnd ready a funeral pyre in the morning, after the raining stops\u201d, he respectively bows his head and did as he was told.<br>\r\nAs the bodies were carried out, I turned to Gwyn, \u201dWhitehill?\u201d, I asked her, \u201dAs in, the daughter of Duke Ludd Whitehill?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYes\u201d, she replied, \u201dI\u2019m sick and tired of everyone in the family talking ill of Asher\u2019s family despite it\u2019s been 500 years, and it wasn\u2019t their fault that our ancestor got exiled\u201d, she turns her head to Asher, \u201dAnd I don\u2019t regret turning my back on them\u201d, she rubs her hand on Asher\u2019s bearded cheek, \u201dAs far as my father and brothers are concerned, they can go to hell\u201d, and she kisses him, and he returns the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sir Malcolm coughs, gaining the attention of the couple. \u201dI think it\u2019s about time for your wife to meet the in-laws\u201d, he says to his nephew, \u201dI don\u2019t doubt your mother will find it hard to control herself when she finds out she\u2019s going to be a grandmother\u201d, and he smiles.<br>\r\n\u201dRight~\u201d, Asher says nervously, \u201dYou coming along Beskha?\u201d, he asked Beskha.<br>\r\n\u201dSure\u201d, she replied, \u201dI\u2019d like the surprises on their faces\u201d, and she chuckles.<br>\r\nAsher looks at me, and I nod with understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they left, Zandria asked, \u201dWho are they?\u201d, gesturing toward the Amazons and the Lionstar-brothers. Oh right, I nearly forgot about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Alvin went first, \u201dI am Sir Alvin of House Lionstar, and these are my brothers Robin and Martin\u201d, he gestures to his brothers.<br>\r\n\u201dI read a book long ago about a knight called \u2019the Lionstar of Morien\u2019\u201d, said Alester.<br>\r\n\u201dHe was our grandfather\u201d, Alvin replied, \u201dAnd he left Albion to defend peoples of other realms in Middle Earth from bandits and monsters. Our father continued that, and with us after we were knighted. And now that father has past, we made the decision to pledge our swords to the King\u201d, and he and his brothers knelt down to one knee, facing me.<br>\r\n\u201dThen I accept\u201d, I said and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was Diana\u2019s turn and says, \u201dI am Diana, Princess of Themyscira, daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Edward the Seafarer. I am here as an emissary of my people\u201d.<br>\r\nZandria was surprised, \u201dI had no idea he bedded an Amazon?!\u201d, she said. All of us looked at her with a raised eyebrow. \u201dWhat?\u201d, she asked, \u201dGeecku and I weren\u2019t with him <i>all the time</i>\u201d, and she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201dIf you knew my mother, you\u2019d know he worked hard for it\u201d, Diana chuckled.<br>\r\nAnd then I asked, \u201dAnd who are your companions?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThey are my sisters of Themyscira\u201d, she replied before introducing them one at the time, \u201dThis is Artemis\u201d, she gestures to the smirking red haired Amazon with the greatsword, \u201dOne of our finest and strongest warriors of our tribe\u201d, then she gestures to the one with short pale blonde hair, \u201dPersephone here is one of our best warriors\u201d, and finally I see another redhead I don\u2019t recognized, \u201dAnd lastly, this is Alexa, Artemis\u2019 younger sister\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dHalf sister\u201d, Artemis said with scorn.<br>\r\n\u201dSame mother, different fathers\u201d, said Alexa, who has very pretty face.<br>\r\nArtemis continued, \u201dShe rather plunge her brain into a book rather than a sword into a body\u201d. Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t see Alexa fight at all.<br>\r\n\u201dIt is important to have knowledge in many things other than fighting\u201d, Alexa said calmly to her sister.<br>\r\n\u201dA wise warrior once told me that an intelligent mind is as dangerous as a double-edged sword\u201d, I told them, making Artemis raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\nPersephone spoke up, \u201dReally didn\u2019t expect such young king to be that wise, and have a face of scarred fighter\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYou can thank a Dragon-kin for this\u201d, I pointed at my two scars on the left side of my face, \u201dWe encountered a group of them on the way home\u201d.<br>\r\nThe Lionstar-brothers, Artemis and Alexa got intrigued and curious, while Persephone said \u201dYou got lucky\u201d, and pulled aside the hair that covered her right eye, revealing a battle scar that ran over her eye, which has a solid, pale green color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarika then suddenly appeared out of nowhere and embraced me. I hugged her back before I hear Diana of Themyscira say, \u201dMarika?\u201d.<br>\r\nMarika let go of me, looks at Diana and says with glee, \u201dDiana?!\u201d, and they hug each other. Wait\u2026<br>\r\n\u201dYou two know each other?!\u201d, I asked them both.<br>\r\n\u201dShe visited Themyscira with her mother and sister and when we were little\u201d, Diana replied.<br>\r\n\u201dMy mom wanted to establish trade relations between us\u201d, says Marika.<br>\r\n\u201dTrade relations?\u201d, I asked her, making her realize her slip up.<br>\r\nDiana looks at Marika and teasingly asked, \u201dYou slept with our brother and you didn\u2019t tell him you\u2019re a royalty?\u201d, making Marika blush extremely red.<br>\r\n\u201dYou\u2019re a princess?\u201d, I asked Marika.<br>\r\n\u201dCrown princess of Teer, to be exact\u201d, Diana replied with a smirk, before turning to our sister, \u201dAnd look at how you\u2019ve grown!\u201d, referring to Marika\u2019s massive breasts.<br>\r\n\u201dOh, but you\u2019re a beauty too!\u201d, she says to Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZandria whispers in my ear, \u201d4 half-siblings in less than a week?!\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYeah\u201d, I whisper back, \u201dWhat are the odds?\u201d.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marika thought I needed some time alone with Diana and the other Amazons knew she could take care of herself. So all four followed the rest to the castle, but not before Marika said goodbye to Chataya (who was sad that Marika\u2019s leaving, but delighted that she had a princess in her employ) and gave me a peck on the lips.<br>\r\nMy Kingsguard stayed and silently waited outside the dining room as we started to talk while drinking orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFurries visits the Amazon Islands?\u201d, I asked my first question to Diana.<br>\r\n\u201dWe have resources and things that can only be found on our islands, and the surrounding seas\u201d, she tells me, \u201dSpices to season meats, and help increase the intimate drive of people\u201d, she blushes on that part, \u201dSugar canes that can be worked into substances to sweeten drinks &amp; breads. One tribe have a lagoon full of sea creatures that can produce luxuries for peaceful trader. We began trading with Furries of South Narnia long before I was born, and it was in the recent decade that North Narnia started trading with us, Teer being the first one\u201d, that\u2019s probably how she knew our father was dead.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd that\u2019s how you and Marika met?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYes, we were both eight years old at that time, and she was a very energetic for someone at that age, but we quickly became best of friends and when our mothers realized we shared the same father, we grew closer as sisters and we kept in touch through letters via trading ships\u201d, she chuckles, \u201dBut I do wish she\u2019d stop detailing all the \u201dfun\u201d she\u2019s been having\u201d.<br>\r\nI chuckle, \u201dNot surprising, and if I hadn\u2019t have eaten a fermented crab, I would have died of exhaustion!\u201d, and I laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana blushed but asked, \u201dYou have that too? One tribe uses that as an alternative to spices\u201d.<br>\r\nI haven\u2019t heard about it until Prince Oberyn introduced it to me as a bet. It\u2019s mostly used in the south of Middle Earth, I\u2019d like to think\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThe Estalian that Furries refer to as \u201dthe Red Viper\u201d?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, he\u2019s a living legend, both as a warrior and a lover. And you\u2019ve seen three of his famous daughters, the Sand Snakes\u201d<br>\r\nShe nodded, \u201dMhm, and they fought like Amazons\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo, you call that a lasso?\u201d, I asked her.<br>\r\n\u201dYou don\u2019t have lassos here in Middle Earth?\u201d, I shook my head before she continued, \u201dA lasso is loop of rope designed as a restraint to be thrown around a target and tightened when pulled. We use regular lassos for horses and cattle. This one has the ability of compelling whoever is in physical contact with it to tell only the truth when questioned, those who try and resist experience a hot burning pain from the lasso. The lasso can also be used as a both offensive and defensive weapon and is indestructible. One of many gifts to our tribe from our Goddess\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat other gifts?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dMy armor, sword, bracelets and shield, all magical in nature\u201d, she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled out my sword and placed it on the table between us, \u201dThis is Excalibur\u201d, I told her, \u201dForged magically by the Lady of the Lake, Goddess of purity and chivalry, and the mighty sorcerer Merlin. They thrusted it into stone and only those who were worthy could pull it out, which is what our ancestor, the first Arthur, did and so began the long line of Pendragon-kings\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana looked at it with admiration before pulling out her own and placing it on the table, \u201dI call this one \u201dGod Killer\u201d, along with the rest it was given by the Goddess to the first Queen of Themyscira, who was also one of the first Amazons\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYou must be very special for being given such powerful items?\u201d, I wondered.<br>\r\n\u201dMy mother was always overprotective of me when I was little. Back then I wanted to be a warrior so badly, and finally mother reluctantly allowed me to train under my aunt and mentor, Antiope, the general of the army of Themyscira\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI guess your mother told your aunt and teachers to go easy on you?\u201d, I chuckle.<br>\r\nAnd Diana chucklingly replies with a smile, \u201dNo, far from it\u2026 Antiope was told to train me harder than any Amazon before me. 5 times harder. 10 times harder! Until I was even better than her, Themyscira\u2019s greatest warrior. I had an extensive training in all forms of Amazonian combat. And before I knew it, I became a formidable warrior who defeated Antiope last year, who gave me her tiara as a symbol of me being the greatest warrior of Themyscira\u201d, she took it off and handed it to me. I looked at it with fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues, \u201dBut over the years of training and reaching adulthood, we all noticed that I am stronger and faster than any Amazon alive. Half-a-year ago, during a training session observed by my mother, I sparred against my fellow warriors, demonstrating my weapons expertise and defeating each of them swiftly\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dNot hard to believe, judging from what I saw\u201d, I added.<br>\r\n\u201dYes\u2026 My final opponent was Antiope herself. The two of us fought with all our might. I managed to disarm her and looked toward my mother for approval. Antiope seized the opportunity to push me to the ground and pick up my sword, admonishing me for letting my guard down. As Antiope slashed at me and forced me backwards I instinctively brought my arms together to block the attack. I clashed my arms gauntlets together, resulting a powerful shock-wave that sent Antiope flying back and left all spectators, and myself, in complete shock\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dLike you did with Hugo and his men\u2026\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dThat was little. If I used full force the damage would have been much worse\u201d, she paused looking at my surprised face before continuing, \u201dAntiope holds no grudge, fortunately. The next day mother, Antiope and I went to the temple of the Gods to find answers. The oracle proclaimed that due to our father\u2019s blood, I was gifted with the strength, stamina, speed, reflexes, agility and endurance of a demigoddess. After that, I put much thought of my parentage, and decided a while ago to journey here as an emissary and meet you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, I asked Diana, \u201dHow did you found your way here?\u201d.<br>\r\nShe answers, \u201dWe amazons as good as warriors as well as sailors. A neighboring tribe had found a map of the world from a raid on a Middle Earth trade ship. My mother knew she couldn't stop me from going, so long as I\u2019m not traveling alone, thus Artemis, Persephone and Alexa came along. And here I am\u201d.<br>\r\nIn astonishment I said, \u201dIncredible. I have so many questions about your people and your home\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\nDiana held up her hand, \u201dPerhaps a later time, now I think we should get some rest. The funeral is tomorrow after all\u201d, she stands up, \u201dBut when we have time for it, let\u2019s talk your childhood and how you got those scars\u201d.<br>\r\nI stood up saying, \u201dDeal. By the way, does your mother have dark hair?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dYes\u201d, she replied, \u201dWhy?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThen it seems our father has a thing for dark-haired women\u201d, I chuckled at the thought.<br>\r\nAs we began walking to the exit, I told her, \u201dAnother thing: never let your guard, because fights are never going to be fair\u201d. She just rolled her eyes and said, \u201dYou sound just like my aunt\u201d, and I laugh in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I completely forgot, on the way back to the castle, I told Diana about another sister of ours, Princess Kairel of Dolandis.<br>\r\nEntering the Maidenvault, we found her Amazon-sisters and Marika interacting with Kairel, Bruma, Panthy, the Vixens Sheila and Artica, and Akita the dragoness. Marika\u2019s obviously joyed of meeting another half-sister, hugging Kairel tightly against her chest, with Kairel seemingly embarrassed. But she is pleased to meet Diana, and instead of a handshake, she receives a hug from our sister.<br>\r\nWhen she looks at me though, after hearing of Herbert\u2019s death, she gives me a hug for the first time since we met a few days ago, as a comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I returned to my bedroom where Zandria was waiting, with sad and teary eyes. She\u2019s holding Balto, my direwolf pup, in her arms between her breasts and told me that Geecku is crying in the gardens after hearing of Herbert, and probably wishes to be alone for now.<br>\r\nThey both have been close to Herbert especially since my parents died. And I feel the same sadness in me, and we both lie in bed, holding each other as I cry my eyes out to sleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up looking at the roof. I turned my head sideways and sees Geecku laying beside me, her beautiful golden eyes red from all the crying last night.<br>\r\nIn Narnia, love making is considered holy, a way of honoring the dead by celebrating life. Herbert told me once that there is nothing wrong with people, human and Furry, comforting each other.<br>\r\nSo, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do now.<br>\r\nI move up above her, pull out my morning-wood and thrust it in her folds. Geecku moans while I slowly move my hips back-and-forth, places her hands on the sides of my face and pulls me in for a kiss, which I responded with passion and letting our tongues move in our mouths (though her very long reptile tongue reached down my throat).<br>\r\nI kept on thrusting for several minutes before releasing inside her. We broke our kissing, Geecku shed a few tears, which I brush off.<br>\r\nWe then notice Zandria standing next to the bed, naked. I roll onto my back, with my shaft still ready to go. Zandria straddles on me and presses the shaft in her.<br>\r\nShe gyrates her hips, making her large, scaly breasts bounce. Normally I would focus on them, but now for the entire time, I focus only on her face, her eyes.<br>\r\nFor several minutes we looked into each other\u2019s eyes until we came, and then we kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating breakfast, Zandria told me that the rains stopped before dawn and preparations for funeral pyre has begun.<br>\r\nI asked who will be attending, other than the ones who were related or close to the dead. She gave me a list of who will come and who will not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are those who\u2019ll come out of respect for Lord Herbert. And those who won\u2019t come, most because the funeral included a prostitute and some out of no respect for the late Steward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWait\u201d, I said, \u201dWhy is Lord John Price and his children and nephews coming, but not his wife?\u201d.<br>\r\nZandria says, \u201dTheir marriage is to be annulled\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhy?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\nShe told me this: after returning to the castle with baby Barra in his arms, Aaron Price revealed everything to his whole family, about how he met Mhaegan, how Barra came to be, how he planned to give up his family-name and move to Estalia with them, up until how the young mother was murdered while defending their child.<br>\r\nTremaine was outrage, and she and her son argued with Aaron defending his daughter while his mother tells him that he brought disgrace to the family.<br>\r\nJohn tried to stop it, but when his wife said that the child should be left in the gutter where it belonged, he slapped her in the face, something he had never done before.<br>\r\nHe then said that while Barra is the child of a one-time prostitute, she\u2019s still their grandchild. And if Tremaine cannot deal with that, then she should not be part of their family. He also said that he knew of her affair with his nephew, Sir Lancel. After telling her that he\u2019s going to Bishop High Sparrow and have their marriage annulled, he chased his now soon-to-be former wife out of their quarters and banned her from seeing his children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThen, what are we gonna do about Sir Lancel?\u201d, I asked Zandria.<br>\r\n\u201dWell, Lord John told Tremaine that she was free to keep fucking Lancel if she so wished, since she\u2019s \u201dan unfaithful harlot\u201d, as he put it. So, Lancel is probably desperate for redemption right now, and that could be of use to us, for we still don\u2019t know what she planed on doing with the wildfire or what she\u2019s planning next\u201d, Zandria replied.<br>\r\n\u201dThen bring him to my quarters after the funeral\u201d, I told her.<br>\r\n\u201dAs you wish\u201d, she said. She paused before saying, \u201dAnother thing, Arthur, about Tremaine\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\nShe replies, \u201dAfter Lord John confronted her about her adultery, Tremaine then yelled at him saying that he had sired bastards through his entire life, and covered it up\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?! That doesn\u2019t make any sense. He\u2019s not the type of man who would do that\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dI agree, Arthur\u201d, said Zandria, \u201dHe never goes to houses of ill-repute for example, and he never had seduced any other woman or sets his sights on one. I should know since I became Spy Mistress and had done background checks on many members of the court\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething feels wrong, but what\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA corpse shall be burned in a funeral pyre, then by tradition the ashes shall be collected together and given to the Cult of Morr, who\u2019s members will spread it out in the ocean.<br>\r\nKing Arthur VIII, my ancestor who reigned from 596 to 619, was extremely afraid of necromancers, due to the horrific \u201dVampire Wars\u201d that plagued the Empire of Sigmar at that time.<br>\r\nHe decreed that all corpses, peasant and noble, are to be immediately burned, not buried (though some noble families place ashes of the heads of the family in crypts). Those who were buried in graveyards long before his reign are to be guarded by the Knights of Morr, the God of Death, to ensure that the dead will not rise from their graves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodies of Herbert Turner, Gawen Sarwyck, Cerenna Westford and Mhaegan were on piles of wood in a shape of an X, with their feet facing the middle.<br>\r\nI stood by Herbert while Alester stood by his brother, Mors by his wife and Aaron by his beloved.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m so sorry, Herbert\u201d, I whispered with my eyes closed and my hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201dHe would have died in a year or two\u2026\u201d, I hear someone whisper. I look up to see an elderly man stand on the other side of Herbert, close to Alester who also heard. This man is bald with wrinkles by his eyes and is dressed in a green clothing of a nobleman.<br>\r\n\u201dA year or two?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he never told you or anyone else, but he was sick with a weak heart. But to think he would be murdered by a madman\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\nAnd then I remember\u2026 \u201dYou were at the funeral of Earl Raynald Sarwyck\u2019s funeral\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dYes\u201d, he replied, \u201dI am Earl Arwood Harlton of Castlewood. Herbert, Raynald and I have long been friends\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI have heard of the Harltons of Castlewood\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dHave we met before?\u201d, asked Alester Sarwyck.<br>\r\n\u201dOh yes, many a time. But the last time we spoke was an age ago\u201d, Harlton replied, \u201dBefore and during the Seafarer\u2019s reign, Herbert and I visited your father many a time. You were young back then and more interested in the art of combat than conversation. More recently, we briefly crossed each other\u2019s paths during your father\u2019s funeral at Riverspring\u2026 But Herbert and I knew it was not the time for discussions. I wish to tell you both that your sudden and unexpected bereavements troubled me deeply, especially when I arrived at the capital last night. Raynald and Herbert were great men and trusted friends\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dWhile Herbert Turner was not a king, he ruled fairly like one\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dMy father isolated his lands and blamed a lot of people for my disappearance\u201d, said Alester.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd sadly, I was there the night he died\u201d, said Harlton, who then asked, \u201dIf it\u2019s not too much trouble, I wish to invite you two to my manse for dinner\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019d be happy to\u201d, I replied.<br>\r\n\u201dMe too\u201d, Alester replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harlton went back to who I presume is his family, Diana and Kairel came up.<br>\r\n\u201dWe are so sorry for your loss, Arthur\u201d, said Kairel.<br>\r\n\u201dThank you\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dYou were very close?\u201d, Diana asked.<br>\r\nI reply, \u201dI was 1 years old when my father and mother died. Along with Zandria and Geecku, he raised me as his own, and he was a good teacher too. And he ruled as a regent for 15 years\u201d, the key he gave me is hidden beneath my clothes. What is it for, and why giving it to me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came Duke Gregor Forrester. After being introduced to my sisters, and had a small talk with them, he turned to me and gave me his condolences.<br>\r\n\u201dHow are you doing?\u201d, he asked me.<br>\r\n\u201dFine, I guess\u201d, I replied, \u201dStill sad though. But I was gonna ask you that\u201d, I asked, referring to Asher and his wife and companion.<br>\r\nGregor chuckled, \u201dElissa, my wife, nearly fainted when we were told we\u2019re gonna be grandparents\u201d, we both chuckle, \u201dAnd whether or not Gwyn was born a Whitehill, she\u2019s part of the family now. As for Asher\u2019s friend, Beskha, I hope she\u2019d make a good addition to our household guard\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI hope so too, from the way she fight\u201d, I agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around. I see Duke Endrew Frost speaking with the eldest daughter of the Forresters, Mira, and Sir Alvin Lionstar with Lady Margaret Rainheart, Edwin\u2019s daughter. Mira seemed shy, while Margaret is giggling, and both were blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around more, I see Mors comforting his daughter, Tya. She and her mother came to the city to rejoin with her father and hope for a good life.<br>\r\nBut now her mother lies dead in front of her, and Tya look at her with tears in her eyes. After a while Mors and his daughter separate, with Tya going to the few soldiers loyal to House Westford, and Mors going to me. I see bandage over where his left eye used to be.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m going the Kingsguard\u201d, he said bluntly.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?\u201d, I asked, \u201dBut Why\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dCerenna was the only woman for me. I cannot see myself married to another woman. As for Tya, She\u2019ll return to Riverspring and I know Sir Ryman will take good care of her\u201d, he kneels down to a knee, \u201dPlease, Your Majesty, accept me as your executioner and Kingsguard\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no choice but to accept.</span></div></div>",

And whatever she says or do, you will tell us everything. And if you do good, you will serve in a templar order for a few years as an act of redemption. Understood?\u201d, I told him.<br>\r\nHe bowed his head and whispered, \u201dYes, Your Majesty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left, I got myself ready to go to Earl Harlton\u2019s residence for dinner. When I opened the door to get out, however, I see Obara, Oberyn\u2019s daughter, and the Lionstar-brothers standing outside.<br>\r\n\u201dSo you allow women into your Kingsguard?\u201d, Obara asked.<br>\r\n\u201dUh\u2026 Yes?\u201d, I answered.<br>\r\n\u201dI want in\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dSo does my brothers\u201d, said Alvin Lionstar.<br>\r\n\u201dLet me get this straight: we just met yesterday, and you heard of my Kingsguard just recently, and you three wanna go celibate?\u201d, I asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\u201dWell I can\u2019t make someone pregnant now would I? And I\u2019m not interested in marriage anyway\u201d, Obara replied, \u201dAnd I\u2019d like to be known as Obara the Sand-Horse\u201d, she added with a smirk. I have to admit, that is a bit catchy.<br>\r\n\u201dAnd I have slept with enough women so I don\u2019t have to worry about dying a virgin\u201d, said Robin Lionstar with a chuckle, \u201dSo I am not interested in marriage either and even less interested in owning lands\u201d.<br>\r\nThen Martin Lionstar says, \u201dAnd I pledge my life to both the Gods and the King, knowing our brother will continue our family legacy\u201d. Huh, didn\u2019t expect this one to be religious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, humans are born free to chose, so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh Sparrow, the Bishop of Camelot, had not left the Castle yet, he was praying to the Gods for mercy for the souls of the dead.<br>\r\nHe made a quick ceremony and I placed the white cloaks on my 3 new Kingsguards, making the total 7. But then High Sparrow suggested that I make it having 12 members, as in 12 months of a year, since my Kingsguard will be protecting me every day and month of the year.<br>\r\nI had to agree with him on that (and order more white cloaks).<br>\r\nHe also insisted that we travel to Lord Marius\u2019 estate in a few more days, so I have time to recover from my loss, before he left for the cathedral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also turns out Diana is also invited to the dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before we ride out, while we all saddle, Diana says, \u201dI met our brother, Gendry, away from prying ears of course\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dHe\u2019s very good with the hammer my Master-at-arms says, but is still practicing with other weapons\u201d, he worried of my safety yesterday, but also disappointed of missing out a fight.<br>\r\n\u201dBut why the secrecy?\u201d, she asks, \u201dHe\u2019s your brother, but doesn\u2019t have the family name?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019am a bastard\u201d, Gendry says next to us, \u201dOur father was already married when he met my mum\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dIf I were to die without issue, Gendry could be a potential heir to the throne\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n\u201dBastard?\u201d, Diana asked.<br>\r\nGendry and I share a look before he asked, \u201dYou don\u2019t have bastard were you\u2019re from?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dAre the customs regarding illegitimate children different in the Amazon Islands?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\n\u201dWell I can tell you both that the concepts of \u201dbastards\u201d or \u201dillegitimate\u201d doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, Diana replied.<br>\r\n\u201dThat sounds liberating\u201d, said Gendry.<br>\r\n\u201dSeems we have much to learn about Amazons\u201d, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe traveled through the streets until we entered the wealthier areas of the City. Houses owned by noble families, merchants and members of the court.<br>\r\nAnd then we came to our destination. \u201dThis is the residence of House Harlton\u201d, said Alester Sarwyck as he stares at large manse in front of us, \u201dThe Earl must be much more important than I thought if he could afford a manse in this part of Camelot\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dWell, he is an Earl from Eastshire after all\u201d, I added.<br>\r\n\u201dI really don\u2019t understand people in this part of the world\u201d, Diana said.<br>\r\n\u201dI don\u2019t blame you\u201d, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose joining me are; may sister Diana of Themyscira, my squire Brian Connor, Earl Alester Sarwyck of Riverspring, my Kingsguard (Commander Sir Thomas Marshall, Sir Adrian Connor, Sir Stephen Clifford, Sir Mors Westford, \u201dthe Butcher\u201d, Obara the Sand-Horse, Sir Robin Lionstar and Sir Martin Lionstar) with their squires (including Gendry) and my other bodyguards (Sir John Connor, Sir Alvin Lionstar, Legolas and Gimli).<br>\r\nThe Amazons who came with Diana are inside the Castle; Alexa is looking into the Royal library while Artemis and Persephone are at the courtyard, practicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlester is dressed in noble clothing while Diana had burrowed one of Zandria\u2019s dresses: a sleeveless one with slits on each side showing her legs, covered in a pair of thigh-high boots. The dress is also designed for riding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked through the open gate and up the stairs. We were then greeted by who I assumed was the captain, \u201dYour Majesty, welcome House Harlton\u2019s residence and I\u2019m captain of the guard, Sir Ethan\u201d, he said bowing his head, and his men does the same.<br>\r\n\u201dWell met Sir Ethan\u201d, I said, \u201dEarl Harlton is expecting us. Accompanying Alester of House Sarwyck and my half-sister Princess Diana of Themyscira\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dAh, so you two are the heretics he\u2019s been talking of. Let me warn you, your worthless religions has no place here\u2026\u201d, says Sir Ethan.<br>\r\nI grab the collar of his armor and shouts at his face, \u201dHow dare you\u2026?!\u201d, but Diana places her hand on my shoulders, telling me to stop.<br>\r\n\u201dWe\u2019re here for dinner with Harlton, not preaching our faith\u201d, she says.<br>\r\n\u201dWe don\u2019t have time for theological debate with his underlings\u201d, said Alester.<br>\r\nBefore letting him go I told him, \u201dShe\u2019s a princess and my sister and he\u2019s of nobility\u2026 Show some respect!\u201d, and I push him off to the stone floor.<br>\r\nAs we went on, Diana tells me, \u201dYou better control your temper\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI\u2019m sorry\u201d, I apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant lead the way to the dining room, where Arwood Harlton waited for us.<br>\r\n\u201dAh, there you all are! Did you meet any trouble on your way here?\u201d, Earl Harlton asked.<br>\r\n\u201dAh well, other than the warm welcome we received from an amateur theologian in your employ, we have no complaints\u2026\u201d, I replied with sarcasm.<br>\r\n\u201dYou must be speaking of Sir Ethan, he\u2019s the captain of my guard. Please forgive him, he is deeply devoted to the Faith. While I was waiting and getting ready for you, I made the mistake of telling him that you, Alester, belong to the Cult of Lightbringer and that you, Princess Diana, are of the Amazons\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dBut the Cult is of the Faith\u201d, said Alester.<br>\r\n\u201dThat\u2019s what I told him, but firmly believes that it\u2019s heretic\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dAnd he foolishly insults a princess\u201d, Diana added, \u201dWhere I\u2019m from, he would have been tortured and killed for that\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dI am very sorry, my Princess\u2026 Anyway, when the other guests arrive, we will the dinner\u201d, Harlton said.<br>\r\n\u201dOther\u2026?\u201d, I wondered, before a young woman entered the room.<br>\r\n\u201dHello, Your Majesty, my lord and princess\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n\u201dHello, my lady. I don\u2019t have I\u2019ve had the honor of meeting you\u201d, said Alester, with a hint interest.<br>\r\n\u201dNeither did I\u201d, I added.<br>\r\n\u201dI am Lady Marianne, niece of Earl Harlton here\u201d, she turns to her uncle, \u201dAnd your wife and son are being comfortable in the main bedroom by the way\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dAh, that\u2019s good!\u201d, Harlton chuckled.<br>\r\n\u201dYou have a wife and son too?\u201d, I asked.<br>\r\n\u201dYes, lovely Sara and our little toddler, Raynald\u2026 I named him after your father, Alester. And they are both my blessings\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dBlessings?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dBefore he married Sara, we were the last two members of the family, you see\u201d, Marianne answered.<br>\r\n\u201dOh\u2026 And how is that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dAh well\u2026\u201d, she looks at her uncle, who nods in approval, before continuing, \u201dMy father was the original Earl of Castlewood, until he was tortured and executed by the Blackadders\u2026 for treason. As I was my father\u2019s only heir, and Uncle Arwood had no heirs of his own, he took me under his wing, and I accompany him on most of his trips\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then we doors open\u2026 To reveal Balian of Ibelin and Duke Gregor Forrester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is going on, and why are they invited?</span></div></div>",

The Kingsguard and bodyguards were standing outside the room, and around the residence, on guard duty.<br>\r\nAs we ate the small but fancy dishes Arwood Harlton had made for us, we talked about small things. Balian of Ibelin asks Diana about Amazon society with genuine interest, Marianne Harlton talks with Alester Sarwyck (with hint of flirting between them), Harlton telling that he knew Herbert Turner and Alester\u2019s father Raynald since they were young men, When I asked about what he meant at the funeral about Herbert \u201ddie in a year or two\u201d, he told me that they corresponded regularly, and Herbert didn\u2019t want me to worry to death over him.<br>\r\nAnd finally, after dinner, Duke Gregor Forrester reveal that he had known my father since they were little boys and they were also friends with Balian\u2019s father, Godfrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYour father and I were both sent to Ibelin to be fostered by Godfrey\u2019s father, the previous Baron, in order for us to establish friendship between us when we grow up\u201d, fosterage is a common practice of a noble raising the child of another noble, \u201dWe were 8 at that time and Godfrey was 6 years older, but he became like a big brother for us.<br>\r\nAnd I tell you, Edward spends more time with books than with sword practice. He was particularly interested in the stories of your ancestor King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dThe Round Table?\u201d, Diana asked.<br>\r\n\u201dA large table around which King Arthur and his knights congregate. It\u2019s round to represent the equality of all the members. The knights were an order in the service of the first King of Albion, tasked with ensuring the peace of the kingdom with ides that might does not make right and that truth, justice, honor and friendship should be the guiding forces in people\u2019s dealings with each other\u2026\u201d, and I kept talking about how my ancestor pulled the sword from the stone, the uniting of the realm, battles against the norsemen, the fair and just rule of Arthur with the wise counsel of Merlin the Wizard, and the fight against Morgana Le Fay and her demon-son Mordred.<br>\r\nDiana\u2019s amazed by the stories of the ancestor we share, and I added that his work to unite the land was similar to Sigmar of the Empire, Gille the Uniter of Bretonnia and House Martell of Estalia. When she asked about Avalon, the place where Merlin buried the King, she\u2019s told that it\u2019s both mythical and unknown, and only first mentioned by Merlin himself when he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then let Gregor continue, \u201dYes, it is well known that Merlin took Arthur\u2019s body across the seas to Avalon, and never seen again\u2026 One day, when we were 12, where we having a lesson about the history of Albion. When the teacher finished the part were Merlin and King Arthur\u2019s body vanished from the isles, Edward raised his hand\u2026 And asked this strangest question: <i>\u201dHow can we be sure Merlin stayed and died in Avalon, if it even exists?\u201d</i>. We didn\u2019t know what to make of it\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana, Balian, Alester and I were surprised by what we heard.<br>\r\n\u201dWhat did he mean by that?\u201d, I asked, \u201dI mean, no one in the world has heard of him in the centuries after King Arthur\u2019s death, right?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201dIt\u2019s well known by historians of Middle Earth\u201d, said Alester.<br>\r\n\u201dBretonnia included\u201d, Balian added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe all asked different questions to him about it too\u201d, said Duke Gregor, \u201dHis thinking, is that as long as there are no evidence to the contrary, we can\u2019t be sure that he died the years after the death of his king. When the teacher argued that like all humans, Merlin would have died of old age. But Edward retorted, <i>\u201dAnd that is precisely what those so-called historians would claim\u201d</i>, while we gave him a confused look he continued, <i>\u201dThink; if those books were to be unbiased, they should say <b>\u201dit is believed that Merlin was mortal\u201d</b>\"</i>.<br>\r\nI told him then, <i>\u201dIf I\u2019m being honest, I think you\u2019re splitting hairs here\u2026\u201d</i>, and he shouted back, <i>\u201dI\u2019m not! It\u2019s a deliberate choice they made!\u201d</i>.<br>\r\nWhen the teacher asked what he meant by that, your father answered, <i>\u201dThese books were commissioned by nobles and councilors with superiority complex, get it? Their intent, is to make us believe that Merlin was a regular mortal human, in fear that there would be cults worshipping him\u201d</i>, when he was asked why he thought Merlin was not mortal he replied, <i>\u201dHe was described as a old man in the time of Arthur pulling the sword from the stone, the very same description he had at the time of the Battle of Flayed Rock. If he really was old in the beginning, why didn\u2019t he die of old age within a few years? And what human sorcerer would have that much magical powers? How could he possibly be mortal?\u201d</i>.<br>\r\n<i>\u201dMaybe they just assumed?\u201d</i>, I asked jokingly <i>\u201dAren\u2019t you getting way into this?\u201d</i>, and your father stormed out frustrated.<br>\r\nI was just laughing at his theories\u2026 And he may have been right\u2026\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised an eyebrow and asked, \u201dMay have been?\u201d. What is he trying to say with all this? Diana, Alester and Balian are just as confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregor Forrester says, \u201dFor several days he was obsessed with Merlin and his apparent \u201dimmortality\u201d and powers.<br>\r\nAnd one day, my father, Duke Thorren the Bold, Sir Arwood Harlton, future Earl of Castlewood, Sir Raynald Sarwyck, heir to Riverspring, and young Herbert Turner, who was not a steward yet, arrived at Ibelin for a visit.<br>\r\nThat night, they called for your father, me and Godfrey to one of the guest rooms. There they told us of what\u2019s really going on\u2026\u201d, he turned to Harlton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Harlton tells us, \u201dDuring the decades after the deaths of Arthur I and his son Loholt the Chivalrous, the Knights of the Round Table began to gradually losing importance and influence.<br>\r\nThe Royal court was getting infested by plotting and intrigue, lords and ladies scheming for power. Eventually, even a few knights of the Order began to thirst for power, making it falling apart from within.<br>\r\nIn the beginning of Year 100 in the Arthurian Calendar, during the reign of King Edward the Confessor, the last few good Knights of the Round Table quickly realized that no matter what, the Order of the Round Table will soon be of no use anymore and extinguished, nothing good would come out of that. And in time, they came to understand that they weren\u2019t the only ones disappointed in its decline. Many others were of the same opinion, lords as well as ordinary men and women. Gradually, they became a very large group and realized that by joining forces, they could perhaps bring about change and ensure the survival of both the Kingdom and the good of Pendragon-bloodline.<br>\r\nBy that year, everyone thought that the Knights of the Round Table have been disbanded, while in reality we became \u201dthe Round Table Brotherhood\u201d.<br>\r\nA brotherhood founded in the beliefs of King Arthur and his knights; peace, truth and honor.<br>\r\nWe tried to place those ideas to every generation of kings in the last 900 years. We succeeded with some, but failed with many.<br>\r\nWe also have the belief that Merlin might return one day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him wide-eyed, \u201dAre you saying\u2026?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYes\u201d, he said, \u201dIt was we who made the books telling that he was a mortal wizard and that he died in Avalon, because we didn\u2019t want people to have too high hopes.<br>\r\nMerlin had confined in Arthur and his knights that he had journeyed through the islands for centuries. The reason was because he\u2019s a half-human, half-demon, created by a demoness named Mab to cause chaos in Middle Earth. But instead, when grown up, he destroyed her, and as a final revenge, she transferred her powers to him claiming he\u2019s cursed to live for eternity.<br>\r\nHe raised young Arthur, helped the Lady of the Lake forging Excalibur, helped the king ruling the realm and fought beside him against Morgana le Fay and Mordred.<br>\r\nWe told all this to your fathers and Gregor here, because we were going to invite both Godfrey and Gregor when they were ready, and we couldn\u2019t ignore your father\u2019s obsession with Merlin\u2019s disappearance. And so, he became the first Pendragon, and later the first king, to know of the Brotherhood\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Information is\u2026POWER!) (Update: planing on a wiki-site of this)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll take control of a ruling family in the island kingdom of Albion. This island nation is located northwest of the continent of Middle-earth. A large continent with many varying fantasy people, creatures and races. Your mission is to guide this family through the ages, through many generations and keep the nation together and your family alive. Should every member of your family die, you will have failed. That\u2019s the end. You can be conquered, you can be killed and your dynasty erased. You may lose the throne, but getting it back may be a challenge. If you really fall far and lose all of your relevance, then your family will fall into obscurity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might not be as easy to survive as you think. Starting off, you'll only have one person. The progenitor of the rest of your line. Customs and traditions in Albion are important and dangerous things may happen if you attempt to subvert them. Kings and Queens cannot take the throne until the age of 16. Until they come of age, the realm is ruled by a regent which holds all the authority and power of a true king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou live in a world full of fantastical people, creatures and magic. Things may not be what they seem and people you might not suspect may be eyeing your throne as their own. Remember: the word of the day is Consequences. You have the power and authority to do as you wish, but others may not approve or it may cause other problems. Making unpopular decisions at court may lead you to taking a knife in the back and of course, even if you avoid that, most people won\u00b4t tolerate a Tyrant for long\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Titles:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitles are important in any feudal society, so you know that who is is charge of whom. Titles come in four tiers that are named based on what type of government they have and how far up the political food chain they are. In a formal setting and even some more relaxed settings, the person\u2019s title is said first, followed by their first name. For example: Countess Marie, Count Deekan, Duke Ducal, etc. In less formal settings, the higher title may drop the lower person\u2019s title. For example if a count and king were having a dinner, the king may say \u201dHey Robert\u201d, but the count must use King, or Your Majesty. Your Highness is used when addressing a prince and Lord is used to address an unlanded noble. That is - noble without any major title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are the different major titles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor feudal rulers (the most common), the titles go: Baron, Count, Duke, King, Emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarons tend to rule over a relatively small estate with a simple castle. Counts (or Earls) rule over whole counties and may have multiple Barons as vassals. Dukes rule over entire regions of counties and may have multiple counts as vassals. Kings, of course, rule over whole kingdoms. Emperors can rule over multiple kingdoms. There are currently two emperors in this world; one in Middle-earth, and one in Cathay (China).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kingdom of Albion:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kingdom of Albion is where most of the story will likely take place. It\u2019s on two islands called Great Albion and Morien and it\u2019s northwest of Middle-earth. Great Albion is moderately prosperous with primarily forests and plains with a few hilly landscapes splattered about. Also a mountain range in the north, small valleys in the south and a swamp in the east.<br>\r\nMorien, the western island, has a long river from west to the center and also have a mountain range near the north side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a thousand years ago, the island was divided in small and rivaling kingdoms. Merlin, the most powerful sorcerer of all times, and the Lady of the Lake decided to form a sword and thrust it into a stone. Merlin proclaims to everyone; \"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king\u201d. The sword was named Excalibur (which means \u201dthe sword of power\u201d). Many knights, warriors, nobles, even peasants had tried, only to fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur, an orphaned young knight raised by a poor hedge knight, decided to try one day. And to his own surprise, he easily pulled Excalibur from the stone. Everyone was so awed that they all knelt before the first true King of the united Albion. He was crowned and given the name for his new dynasty: Pendragon (which means \u201dson of the dragon\u201d).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 40 year reign of King Arthur was peaceful and prosperous. He was as wise as he was brave, and thanks to his military prowess and Merlin\u2019s counsel he successfully defended the realm from a massive invasion of the norse vikings in the Battle of Badon.<br>\r\nArthur later married a young maiden named Guinevere and together they had a son named Loholt, who became an embodiment of chivalry. <br>\r\nHe also created a round table and established the Knights of the Round Table : an order of knights dedicated to bring peace and stability to the realm.<br>\r\nMerlin, advisor and friend of the king, helped him build a castle around the stone from which Excalibur was pulled. It is today one of largest castles in the known world: Camelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a great threat began to arise: Arthur\u2019s unknown older half-sister, Morgana Le Fay. She was born with dark magic and is as powerful as Merlin.<br>\r\nMorgana made a pact with the God of Chaos. In exchange for giving Morgana the Demon-army she needed to gain the throne from her brother, he demanded that she bear him a son, which she gladly accepted. The result became a immortal, demonic warrior who couldn't be killed by any mortal weapon or by any sorcerer alive: Mordred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mordred turned 20 and his training was completed, it was time for Morgana Le Fay to strike. However Arthur and Merlin had already found out about her plan, and spent 20 years to prepare for the upcoming and deadly battle.<br>\r\nWhen Morgana and her small but powerful army of demons arrived through a large portal and was getting ready to attack Arthur, a thick mist suddenly appeared, blinding them all. Merlin created the mist with the help from witches and wizards who joined Arthur and his army to the advantage in the fight against the demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Battle lasted through the night, and despite the heavy losses inflicted upon Arthur\u2019s army, it was turning victorious when the demons in Morgana's army was nearly exterminated, and the few who survived fled back through the portal which immediately closed. Finally Arthur and Merlin dueled Mordred and Morgana respectively. Morgana\u2019s magic was too powerful for Merlin to defeat. But that changed thanks to Arthur. Since Excalibur was forged by a more powerful magic it was able to destroy any demon-born, so Arthur was forced to kill Mordred, his nephew. Mordred\u2019s death made Morgana extremely weak and Merlin was able to destroy her once and for all. But when the sun rose in the horizon, nobody celebrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany died in the Battle of Flayed Rock, and King Arthur was mortally wounded. Arthur asks one of his surviving knights to thrust Excalibur back into the stone in Camelot. When Loholt asked his father why, the dying king proclaimed that <i>\u201donly a true king of Albion shall wield the sword. And when a king dies, his son will draw the sword from stone\u201d</i>. It means that Excalibur will pass down from one king, who deserves to wield it, to the next of the Pendragon bloodline. Those were last words of King Arthur, and Merlin took his body to Avalon to be buried. And Merlin was never seen again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoholt later pulled Excalibur from the stone and was then crowned King of Albion, and the bloodline went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the last nine hundred years of history, while there was peace and prosperity, Albion was also inflicted occasionally by war, tyranny, reaving, famine, sickness, dragons (last one seen in Albion and Middle-earth was less than a hundred years ago) and civil war (fortunately Excalibur never fell in the hands of those who were not worthy). And the Round Table company had ceased to exist by the beginning of the first century. But the Table itself remained to this day as a reminder of \u201dthe old days\u201d, and the chivalry of the knights of the Round Table lived on in memory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 years ago. Edward, only son and heir of King Oliver I (his mother died at childbirth and father refused to marry after that), decided on his 17th birthday to sail to the giant continent of Narnia in the far west beyond the island-continent of Ulthuan (home of the High Elves). Filled with civilizations with very fascinating peoples living there: Furries. He wanted to travel along the coasts and see the inlands of that world. This continent is also a valuable source of trading with all kinds of resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father was afraid he would never see his son again and that Albion would be without a king when he dies, but he reluctantly let him go. Edward promised to come home and after having tearful a farewell with his father, he began his journey west, knowing it will be years before he returns home, but not that he will be named \u201dthe Seafarer\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward and his crew journeyed west while resupplying at both Misty Isles and Ulthuan. Not long afterwards they arrived in Narnia and as expected, the Furries are being very welcoming to the foreigners, nearly naked and the females are extremely beautiful and have bodies that a few human women could possibly have. A feast was assembled by the local Lion King with the prince and the crew as the honor guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Edward\u2019s crew of young men to get used to the customs of the Furries, as they began to get \u201dacquainted\u201d with the local females. And soon Edward fell for the temptations the females had to offer, including the lion queen and her daughters. And he didn't have any regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following years he explored the continent from north to south and back. During this time he mated with many female furries and they all had his bastard children (all born Furries). Finally, after nearly ten years, he wanted to go home, but his crew did not want to leave the pleasures of Narnia. He did convince them to drop him off at Ulthuan before they went back to the beauties while Edward booked an Elven ship home to Albion. However he was not alone (i\u2019ll tell you guys later at the character-list).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father was already on deathbed, so Edward \u201dthe Seafarer\u201d became King Edward VII when his father died and later married lady Mariam of house Haytham, and was given a son he named Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward's reign ended however when he and his queen died in a shipwreck fifteen years ago, leaving their one year old boy to inherit the throne as the youngest king in history. Today he is crowned Arthur XV of House Pendragon. Today, he is the one who wields Excalibur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaws and Traditions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbion has Male-Preferred primogeniture succession laws. This means that the oldest son of the King or Queen will inherit. Should a King or Queen die before their child reaches the age of 16, a regent will be put in place. The regent is only around until the new ruler reaches the appropriate age. A child\u2019s parent will always be the preferred regent. Should neither of the parents survive, the council will dictate who will be regent. Typically picked from among themselves. The council also has the power to legitimize bastards, if there are no other legitimate children to the previous and there\u00b4s sufficient evidence that an illegitimate child was conceived by that ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by tradition before the coronation, a king must draw Excalibur from the stone to see if he is worthy to be King of Albion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Council: The council is a group of people who helps the king with the day to day politics of the realm. The positions in the council are; Royal Chancellor (chief advisor to the king and is the executor of his commands), Steward (head of the treasury and finances of the kingdom), Lawmaker (overseer of the law and justice for the kingdom), Court Mage (king's advisor on magic and healer), Marshal (advisor on military matters and commander of royal soldiers), High Admiral (commander of royal ships), Royal Priest (advisor on religious matters) and Spy Master (and the head of intelligence).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Talent: In order to protect the realm from mages gaining too much power; people (both peasants and nobles) that show a talent for magic are sent off to the Coven of Magi to be trained as a sorcerer. The Coven was founded by Merlin and is located in the Crownlands, on the south-side of the mouth of River Mere, facing Camelot.<br>\r\nNobles with titles or in line to receive a title are required to to abdicate unless there is no legitimate heir.<br>\r\nWhile the Empire of Sigmar have battle wizards, Albion's mages are only used for defense against demons and dark magic, and healing wounded soldiers. They are also educated to be advisors on magical matters for kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReligion: The most dominant religion in Albion, and most of Middle-earth, is simply referred to as <b>the Faith</b>. The only parts of Albion where the Faith is not widespread are the Duchies of Ironrath and the North, where the practice of the Old Gods (trees and rocks with carved faces, wooden figurines, rune-stones and stone circles) are still strong. The gods of the Faith are sometimes known as the <b>new gods</b> to differentiate them from the older religions. Laws of hospitality are considered sacred for the old gods and the new.<br>\r\nBoth men and women can be priest and priestess respectively. The figurehead is known as the High Priest and he rules from the Great Temple in Altdorf, the imperial capital. There are temples, monasteries, nunneries and holy sites in most parts of Albion.<br>\r\nTo become a knight, a squire must be anointed in the name of the new gods.<br>\r\n- List of Gods prayed to and worshiped in the Faith:<br>\r\n-- Taal - God of the Wilds and the husband of Rhya (by hardy woodsmen, trackers, and rangers)<br>\r\n-- Rhya - Goddess of Agriculture, Community, Well-being, Health, Love, Fertility, and Birth and the wife of Taal (by peasants, mothers, wives and daughters)<br>\r\n-- Manann - God of the Seas and the Tides and the son of Taal and Rhya (by sailors and fishermen)<br>\r\n-- Ulric - God of Winter, Wolves and Battle and the younger brother of Taal (by warriors)<br>\r\n-- Morr - God of Death, Dreams and Dreamers and the husband of Verena (by his followers)<br>\r\n-- Verena - Goddess of Knowledge, Science, Law and Justice and the wife of Morr (by scholars and lawmen)<br>\r\n-- Myrmidia - Goddess of Warfare and Strategy and the daughter of Morr and Verena (by soldiers and generals)<br>\r\n-- Shallya - Goddess of Mercy and Healing and the daughter of Morr and Verena (by the weak and the helpless, the sick and the injured)<br>\r\n-- Ranald - God of Trickery and Thieves (by thieves, tricksters and gamblers)<br>\r\n-- Sigmar - God of mankind, the founder of The Empire, considered to have ascended to Godhood.

Incest was a common practice among our historical rulers and that practice also exists on Middle-earth. However, Incest between siblings is considered taboo and the children of such union are considered abominations. Typically these children are abhorrent in the eyes of the nobility and subjects alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResources: Albion is rich with resources like gold, silver, iron, copper, amber and ironwood (a type wood that is known to be hard to break and is not so easy to burn, therefore making it invaluable as furnitures for the wealthy or as shields for knights). This makes this nation a profitable trading partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKinslaying: That is also a great taboo next to Incest. Any individual who kills a member of their own family (both noble and subject) is dubbed a Kinslayer, and believed to be cursed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrency: In every land, people refer to coins by common names. Gold coins are Gold Crowns, silver coins are Silver Shillings, and copper are Pennies.<br>\r\n- 1 Gold Crown = 20 Silver Shillings = 240 Pennies<br>\r\n- 1 Silver Shilling = 12 Pennies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthurian Calendar (AC): The Known World takes 400 days to travel round its sun, a much larger and hotter star than our own, and is orbited by two moons. The larger of these - known in The Empire as Mannslieb (\"Beloved of Manann\") - has a cycle of 25 days from full to full and looks not unlike the moon of our own world. The other - named Morrslieb (\"Beloved of Morr\") - is erratic, appearing now closer, now further away than its partner.<br>\r\nThe <b>Arthurian Calendar</b> is the official calendar of Albion and the usual metric used to describe events in the Kingdom. It is centred around the year of King Arthur I Pendragon's coronation, 0.<br>\r\nThe Calendar is of great importance and influence in Albion. It allows the common folk to count the passing days and prepare for the festivals. It allows for historical events to be recorded and contextualized in time.<br>\r\nIt's inspired by the Imperial Calendar in the Empire of Sigmar, and formed by the powerful sorcerer Merlin. The dating system splits the 400-day year into twelve months of 32 or 33 days, and includes six important festival days, each of which lie between the months. The months are further divided by eight-day weeks, which bridge the months uninterrupted, even if a week is broken by one of the intercalary festivals.<br>\r\nLike any other kingdom, Albion has its own names for the months of the year;<br>\r\n1. Frostmoot (January)<br>\r\n2. Deepsnow (February)<br>\r\n3. Winterwane (March)<br>\r\n4. Rainmoot (April)<br>\r\n5. Palesun (May)<br>\r\n6. Highsun (June)<br>\r\n7. Firemoot (July)<br>\r\n8. Firewane (August)<br>\r\n9. Lowsun (September)<br>\r\n10. Redfall (Oktober)<br>\r\n11. Snowmoot (November)<br>\r\n12. Fellnight (December)<br>\r\n\"Moot\" means \"meet\" or Meeting.<br>\r\nThe eight days of the week are: Workday, Levyday, Marketday, Bakeday, Taxday, Kingday, Startweek, and Festag (Holiday).<br>\r\nThe reasons for these names are long-forgotten and probably originated in pre-Empire times. Nowadays, market day occurs on any day of the week depending on which part of the kingdom you are in, and festivals and holidays take place according to the traditions of each city or town. There is no weekly religious holiday, but everyone seizes the chance to celebrate at festival times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilitary: The military of Albion include knights, infantry, archers, crossbowmen, men-at-arms, lancers, militia and heavy artillery (catapults and trebuchets). A knight wears a suit of plate armour over their chainmail. The few fleets of this nation (owned by houses Blackadder, Haytham, Greystone, Mercia and Vectis) have a few of the best and fastest ships in the known world.<br>\r\n60 years ago, King Robert I Pendragon formed an army loyal only to the crown. The now 6,000 strong Royal Army is led by the Marshal of the Council. It has currently 6 regiments with 1,000 men each.<br>\r\n(There is no such thing as gun powder in this universe)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapons: Knights uses different types of swords; longsword (one-handed), greatsword (two-handed) and bastard sword (a hand-and-a-half). They also uses clubs, maces, war hammers (long two-handed) and lances. Other mounted troops also uses lances.<br>\r\nMost infantry uses spears and shields, and also shortswords, falchions and daggers.<br>\r\nArchers uses bows and arrows while crossbowmen uses crossbows.<br>\r\n(more info on weapons and armour: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armament\" target=\"_blank\">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armament</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaw-enforcement: Upholding the law is very important in the kingdom. In a village there is a sheriff and his deputies, in a town there is a town watch and in a city there is a city watch. They keep the peace, maintain public order and defend the cities and towns from attacks of enemy armies.<br>\r\nThe City Watch of Camelot, also known as \"gold cloaks\", are the 1,000 strong defenders of the city of Camelot (the castle with the same name is defended by the castle guards) and the enforcers of the law, sworn only to the Crown. The City Watch wear cloaks, usually made of heavy wool, dyed gold. They are equipped with mail armor, iron cudgels, iron spears, dirks, and occasionally longswords. Their armor, boots, and gloves are black. The officers (such as the captains of the gates of the city walls) wear black breastplates ornamented with four golden disks. They can be used as guards, foot soldiers or in some cases, as mounted lancers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcalibur: Also known as the \u201dSword in the Stone\u201d it is a powerful weapon forged by magic. Light as a feather, hard as a dragon\u2019s scales and so sharp it can cut through steel.

It sits along the mouth of River Mere by the sea in the east, north of Andredesweald Forest in the Crownlands (region of Diocletia), in southeastern Albion. Currently the largest city in the realm with 50,000 citizens, surrounded by high strong walls, protecting the city from sea-based raids and land-based attacks. This city is often looked big enough for more because of the Cathedral, the barracks and the headquarter of the city watch, and all the various shops, apothecaries, brothels, guilds, manses (homes of the rich) and orphanages.<br>\r\nThe castle is located on Excalibur\u2019s High Hill and is made of pale grey stone. It has seven massive drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts. Massive curtain walls surround the keep, with nests and crenelations for archers. Thick stone parapets, some four feet high, protect the outer edge of the wall ramparts, where the heads of traitors are traditionally placed on iron spikes between the crenels at the gatehouse. The walls have great iron gates and portcullises, with narrow postern doors nearby. The immense barbican has a cobbled square in front of it. Behind the walls are small inner yards, vaulted halls, covered bridges, barracks of the household guards, dungeons, granaries and hot springs.<br>\r\nThe godswood is an acre of elm, alder and black cottonwood trees that overlook the Bay of Kings. The heart tree, a tree with carved face of the old gods, is a great oak, whose limbs have become overgrown with smoke berry vines. The godswood is also a large part of the Camelot gardens.<br>\r\nInside, the keep holds the seat of the monarch in the throne room, and has several gathering halls, including the Queen\u2019s Ballroom. Doors are made of oak banded with black iron.<br>\r\nThe royal chapel inside Camelot has crystal windows placed high in the walls. It is located in front of the Maidenvault.<br>\r\nThe throne room itself is cavernous, and can sit 1,000 people. It is oriented north to south, with high, narrow windows on the eastern and western walls.<br>\r\nThe Stone, from which Excalibur was pulled out, is located on the main courtyard.<br>\r\nDragon\u2019s Holdfast is a massive square fortress inside the heart of Camelot Castle. Named after the sigil of House Pendragon, it is a castle-within-a-castle and is the strongest place in Camelot. The holdfast lies behind walls twelve feet thick. A dry moat lined with a bed of formidable iron spikes surrounds it, with a drawbridge spanning the moat. The only way in or out of Dragon\u2019s is across the drawbridge. Two household guards are always posted at its far end. The royal apartments are located in Dragon\u2019s Holdfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiocletia - The county of Diocletia (named from the original name of the region) lies west of Camelot by the north bank of River Mere. It\u2019s been ruled by the Lennon family for generations and is directly under vassalage of the King of Albion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIbelin - A castle belonging to the House of Ibelin. Ibelin is a square enclosure, with four towers. It is located northeast of Diocletia in the Crownlands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRottingham - A town in the mists of Sherweald Forest. The sheriff there is obsessed with hunting down the outlaw Robard Hode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiverspring - The seat of House Sarwyck. The town is situated near the source of the River Mere and its castle contains a godswood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWood's Mark - A ruined castle on the edge between Crownlands and Sherweald Forest. Founded in the time of King Arthur I Pendragon, but got burned by Alaric \"the Mad\". Believed to be cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoads and Rivers: Albion has a wast network of roads on the island and they are all made of stone (except in the north were the roads are of dirt).<br>\r\nThere are currently three rivers in Albion: River Mere in the south, River Heaver in the north and River Saffron at the central Albion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessages: Both riders and birds are used to deliver messages between towns, cities and castles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherweald Forest - Also known as The Great Woods of Sherweald. Sherweald Forest lies on the central region of Albion. The legal boundaries is split reasonably between the two duchies of Westryk and Eastshire. It is also rumored to be full of strange creatures and monsters (it\u2019s curious how Robard Hode and his merry men would survive in there if there were any).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYnys Wydryn - A line of tall and massive mountains in northern Albion, the name means \u201dthe Frozen Teeth\u201d for their frozen mountain tops. The mountain range runs from the inside of the northern Sherweald Forest to right next to the ocean in the northernmost of Albion. Serves as a border between the regions Dumnonia (west) and Berengaria (east). Ynys Wydryn is much more inhospitable than others having rough mountainous terrain. The lake Troll Tarn is right in the middle of the southern line and is connected to River Saffron as it goes south through the mountains into the Sherweald and turn east and gets divided to three smaller rivers (Red Saffron, Blue Saffron and Green Saffron) just before they continue to towards the sea. River Heaver in the north goes from the sea in the east though the northern mountains into sea in the west.<br>\r\nAfter mineral wealth was discovered on one of mountains in Eastshire-part of the range by a dwarf lord named Durin, a dwarf colony was established very long ago, forming the Kingdom of Erebor (meaning \"the lonely mountain\") with Durin as its first \"King under the Mountain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaredesweald Forest - Also known as \u201dThe Iron Forest\u201d as it is the largest ironwood forest in Albion. The forest stretches all over the entire southwestern peninsula and is part of the Duchy of Ironrath. The Saxony peninsula is named after a famed warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndredesweald Forest - A large forest in the southern Crownlands. It is currently being protected by House Wolfsbane (family of the Marshal). South of River Mere. Also home of unicorns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlayed Rock - An area of swamps in eastern Eastshire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchy of Ironrath - The Duchy of Ironrath lies on the southwestern Albion. Ironrath lies nestled between the Duchy of Westryk and Sherweald Forest to the north, Andredesweald Forest to the east and the sea to the south and west. <br>\r\nIt\u2019s ruled by House Forrester. An old family with a long tradition of honor and loyalty who rule from the ironwood castle Ironrath by the edge of the forest. <br>\r\nThe duchy also include the merchant city of Mercia. The faith of the old gods is strong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchy of the North - The Duchy of the North controls the regions of Dumnonia and Berengaria in northern Albion. These hardy regions form together a large land with fields, valleys and inhospitable mountains. This duchy includes Ynys Wydryn, a large mountain range. The faith of the old gods is strong here also.<br>\r\nRuled for generations by the House of Frost from Frost Wolf, a castle built into the northernmost mountain, facing the cold winds coming from the north. <br>\r\nThese regions houses the few but powerful Wolf Warriors. These powerful men have honed their skill against the dangers of the land. The only trees here are in the (very) small forest by the northern coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchy of Eastshire - A duchy that controls the eastern coast of Albion and eastern half of Sherweald Forest. <br>\r\nRuled by House Blackadder from the city Durnovaria. House Blackadder is currently the richest house in Albion, by owning the gold and silver mines in the region.<br>\r\nEastshire is the most populated region in Albion.<br>\r\nThe wealthy and fertile region by the sea has been and often is the target of raiders from pirates to foreigners, along with Morien.<br>\r\nTo the south it borders Diocletia (the Crownlands) and Westryk to the west and the region of Berengaria to the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchy of Westryk - Lies on the western coast and controls western half of Sherweald Forest. Ruled by House Haytham from Wickford. The king\u2019s mother was of House Haytham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchy of Morien - Formerly a smaller island kingdom (a quarter the size) next to Albion to the west. Centuries before the first Pendragons, they were strongly independent and fought off both raiders and invaders.<br>\r\nThanks to a lucrative trade with both the neighboring realms of Bretonnia and Albion in the east and the lands of Ulthuan and Narnia in the west, this island nation gains wealth that rivals House Blackadder, not to mention its gold and silver mines.<br>\r\nMorien joined the unity of Albion when King Arthur married Guinevere, daughter of Earl Patrick Leodegrance of Carmelide and the niece of the ruler of Morien, who bent the knee. Since then, lords of Morien were loyal to the kings of Albion (with the exception of tyrants, madmen and usurpers of course).<br>\r\nMorien is also known having the best archers in the realm, that even rivals the elves.<br>\r\n(Morien's culture is based on medieval Ireland, Scotland and Wales)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuchy of Diocletia - A rarely held title as it is typically only held used as a titular title for family members of the King and the king rules from the Crownlands (the region was originally named Diocletia). This region border the south of Sherweald Forest also covers the entire Andredesweald Forest and the hills southwest of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The world around Albion:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/0/06/Old_Albion_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160414131715\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/0/06/Old_Albion_1.jpg/rev...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Aeryn and Albany</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The island of Aeryn is about two-thirds the size of Albion and lies north of Morien, infested with Dragon-kin, war-like decedents of the ancient Dragon-Emperors. Once the seat of the great Akhenaton Empire which once ruled over all the islands, 10,000 years before the start of this story. After its collapse, the island dissolved into warring tribes (clutches) and nearly always collapses into civil war after the death of the previous High Warlord, the de-facto ruler of Aeryn.<br>\r\nThe known clutches on this island are Fire, Moon, Darknight, Wood (in the island's only forrest), Water (by the island's only lake), Rock (rules on the island's only mountain range), Grass, Ice, Earth and Air.<br>\r\nIt's not rare for bands of Dragon-kin to raid coasts on nearby islands for many things, including slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Albany is a smaller island east of Aeryn and north of Albion. This island is inhabited by tribes of woad-wearing humans led by Truthsayers, druids and wise elders.<br>\r\n(Based on Celtic Britains and Scottish Picts)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Middle-earth</u> (analogous to real world Europe)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/35/69/5c/35695c03ac76fd3c5a1dc87577c8cb77.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/35/69/5c/35695c03ac76fd3c5a1dc875...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso known as \"the Old World\", a continent with many different races, cultures and nations. The Middle-earth consists of mostly human nations, but it also holds the Dwarf Kingdoms and the land of the Wood elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE EMPIRE OF SIGMAR - The Empire has stood for over 2500 years as the most powerful nation of men in Middle-earth and is loosely based on late medieval Germany. The Empire was founded by Sigmar Heldenhammer from a collection of warring tribes inhabiting the region that is now the Empire. Sigmar was of the Unberogen tribe who inhabited what is now Reikland, and he is now the patron deity of the Empire. The territories of the other tribes now exist as the Empire's various other states such as Ostland and Talabecland. The Empire is led by an Emperor, though he is elected from and by the ranks of the Elector Counts, rulers of each individual state. Though it has gone through various periods of fragmentation, it was reunited two centuries ago into the strong power it now is by Emperor Magnus the Pious. Its dates are measured with the Imperial Calendar, IC. The current Emperor is Karl Franz from the capital city of Altdorf. He is said to be the greatest statesman ever seen. Altdorf is also the home of the High Priest of the Faith.

It was formed from a collection of warring Dukedoms by Gilles le Breton at the bidding of the Lady of the Lake, who would later become the patron deity of Bretonnia.<br>\r\nBretonnia is the second largest nation in the Old World after the Empire and has a strict class system where the upper class abide by principles of chivalry and are rich and educated. The lower class makes up the majority of the population, and is made up of oppressed peasants. Bretonnians favors more traditional mounted combat using knights, accompanied by hordes of peasant footmen as support.<br>\r\nThe Knights of Bretonnia are regarded as the greatest in Old World, and all male nobles are expected to train in the arts of war and chivalry, or face dishonor. Most renowned of all are the Grail Knights, beings who have supped from the Holy Grail and become imbued with strength and longevity.<br>\r\nBretonnia is ruled by a Royarch, a fearsome warrior-king. The current Royarch is King Louen Leoncoeur - The \"Lionhearted\".

Kislev is ruled by the Tzar and the Ice Queen and bears the brunt of most Chaos invasions. Erengrad, Kislev (the capital) and Praag are the three largest cities in Kislev, with Erengrad and Praag both being situated on the river Lynsk, Kislev's largest river. Kislev was founded around 1000 years after the Empire by Gospodar and Ungol tribes. Its main god is Ursun, the father of Bears, at least in the Gospodar influenced south. In the nomadic north, the Ungol tribes keep the worship of Dazh and Tor alive, as well as the veneration of minor spirits.

Tileans are known as extremely skilled traders and are able to swindle anyone but the cunning Arabyans into a bad bargain, and to take great offence at having their personage or accent mistaken as coming from Estalia. Most warfare in Tilea is conducted through the hiring of mercenaries. (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.geocities.ws/oldsage.geo/tilea-map.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.geocities.ws/oldsage.geo/tilea-map.gif</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nESTALIA - Estalia, a peninsula southwest of Bretonnia, is loosely based upon the culture, history and language of late medieval Spain and was once divided up in various rival city-states such as Magritta and Tobaro.<br>\r\nEstalians take great offense at being mistaken for Tileans and vice versa despite the similarities of their native languages. Estalian steel is famed throughout the Old World for its quality, and Estalia was famously invaded by a Sultan of Araby, which served as the inciting incident for the Crusades. The resulting Crusade involved soldiers from as far away as The Empire, Bretonnia and Albion.<br>\r\nSince the crusades, it has been united under the kings and queens of Estalia (from the current capital, Magritta).

Its people built great cities out of white stone and carved marble. They constructed vast roads and fleets of ships to connect each city to its neighbors. Mighty kings, whose every whim was law, ruled the people. Vast armies of disciplined soldiers were raised and trained in the king's name, and those that invaded their cities were mercilessly cut down.<br>\r\nThe pyramids of these lands are the final resting places of dead kings and are always protected from tomb-raiders who seeks the treasures within.<br>\r\nSince the defeat of Nagash (a priest-king and a necromancer) and the first vampires, the cities of Nehekhara have furiously defended their peoples for thousands of years from both necromancers and invaders.<br>\r\nThe Great Vitae River, or the River of Life, is a mighty life-giving river which flows throughout the lush and plentiful valleys of Nehekhara, providing its inhabitants with some of the most fertile lands within the world. Forming the fertile cradle from which the first Human civilization was founded, the Great Vitae River provided enough trade along its waterways and food from the fertile soil to sustain and uplift the petty nomads of the desert from their primitive existence into the first Human civilization.<br>\r\n(Inspired by Ancient Egypt and its Pharaohs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Races:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Humans</u><br>\r\n- Humanity is by far the second most numerous race in the world. They have the most varied cultures and several kingdoms while other races are far more united in their causes. They also have a high amount of sexual compatibility\u2026being able to breed with just anything that\u00b4s humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Furries</u><br>\r\n- The furries are most numerous and varied race in the world, even outnumbering the humans. All Furries are mammals, avians, reptiles, simians and amphibians. The males are known to be strong and the females are strikingly beautiful with their voluptuous bodies. The natives either speak with their own tongue or the tongue of other peoples and they go nearly naked.<br>\r\nThe act of lovemaking is considered an important and even holy skill. Prostitution is a respectable profession, practiced even by the high-born furries (which is why they\u2019re are seen in many brothels in Middle-earth and Albion). The furries respect their elderly, and mourning customs include celebrating the dead with wine and lovemaking. Be warned though that Incest is quiet common among lions, rabbits and cows.<br>\r\nThe best bows are made here and they also make a sweet amber wine. Their diet consists primarily of crops, vegetables, fruits and fish.<br>\r\nAll furries are treated as equals and bastards are being appreciated by their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Amazons</u><br>\r\n- Not much is known in Middle-earth about how this particular group of humans came about. No archeological expedition has ever been done, or at least have the team return home with the research. <br>\r\nWhat is known from the tales of those that have survived their raids, is that the Amazon women are some of the strongest, fiercest warriors on the battlefield. They also appear to make fantastic sailors, particularly on the unforgiving open seas - a feat that seems to be matched only by the sailors of Araby, and the vikings. <br>\r\nFew survivors, so far, have been able to accurately sketch or draw the images of these strong, yet feminine women. An even smaller amount of survivors have written or verbally told tales of their passion for sex, and the amount of freedom they have in having sex, compared to the people of Middle-earth. <br>\r\nFew accounts of their religion is known, but some believe that their religion is based on ancient pantheon of gods, led by some kind of goddess that fuels their passion for love and battle. <br>\r\nRecently, few accounts of these Amazon women have reached Albion, telling a bit more about their culture on their tropical islands, and why the women seem to be picky about their sex partners. What cannot be denied, is their battle skills, seemingly able to match the Elves with their archery skills, and the elite warriors of Middle-earth with their ability to handle a wide range of weapons, especially the spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Elves</u><br>\r\nThe Elves are one of the most ancient and powerful of all the intelligent races of the World. They are tall, slender humanoids who are inherently magical and live for millennia. There are three main factions of Elves in the world: the High Elves, Dark Elves and Wood Elves.<br>\r\nCompared to humans, Elves are taller on average, fair-skinned, and slender. They possess high cheekbones and slightly angular faces and slanted eyes. Some depictions show them with completely black eyes, while in others they possess human-normal pupils and irises.<br>\r\nHigh Elves are often shown with blonde hair, Wood Elves with brown and Dark Elves with black, white or gray, but these changes are minor and cosmetic and the three groups are for the most part physically indistinguishable and all members of the same species. What defines each kindred of Elves more than anything else is their different cultures.<br>\r\nAssuming they do not die a violent death, Elves are capable of living for several thousand years. It is not considered impossible for an Elf to live seven thousand years or more, although only a few could claim such an achievement at present. Most often an Elf will not die of old age in the human sense, rather he or she will simply grow weary of the world's troubles and lose passion for life, eventually slipping away into death.<br>\r\nElves are inherently magical, and their long lives provide magically-gifted elves more than enough time to train their skill at controlling many of the Winds of Magic. This is in contrast to human wizards, who can usually only hope to wield one form of magic during their lifetimes. Elves are resistant to disease and to physical mutations. They are also known to be the best archers in the world.<br>\r\n- The High Elves are one of the most ancient and powerful mortal civilizations within the known World. Hailing from a mighty mist-shrouded island-continent located within the centre of the Great Ocean, the High Elves of Ulthuan are a proud and mighty nation of masterful warriors, peerless mages and lords of the sky and sea. They are an ancient race with powerful armies and even grander magic, building a grand and all-mighty civilisation who, alongside the Dwarfs, fought a long-forgotten, apocalyptic war which saw some of the greatest and most powerful mortal heroes battle against the great darkness that tried to consume the world many thousands of years ago.<br>\r\n- The Wood Elves, are a reclusive, secretive and highly isolationist race of Elves that have long ago voluntarily split off from the rest of their kin, preferring instead to live out their lives in Nature's embrace beneath the enchanted forested canopy of Athel Loren. From here, they have learnt to dwell in concord with the seasons and the weave of life and death that binds all living things together. They are the defenders of the forest, guardians of all things natural and pure. For millennia, the Wood Elves have lived in this state of harmony, lying in wait and hidden from the prying eyes of the wider World.<br>\r\n- Few ancient books tell of how the Dark Elves came to be, but all of them very ancient stories of a rebellious group of High Elves that worshipped ancient dark gods, particularly a \u201dSpider Goddess\u201d. When these rebels were defeated, they were banished to the underworld, never to see the light of the stars and the moon again.<br>\r\nInstead of dying off, these exiled Elves adapted to life underground, incorporating things learned or taken from the Dwarfs, building cities in the deep caves.<br>\r\nTo adapt to underground life, the color of their skin evolved to a dark, ebon color, while the color of their hair changed either to black or to shades of white and gray. Their eye color tend to be in shades of red, although some exhibited other colors.<br>\r\nMuch like the Dwarfs and the humans of the Empire and Araby, they have perfected the crossbow, favoring one-handed versions equipped with sleeping poison bolts. They also match their surface counterparts in the use of magic.<br>\r\nEach Dark Elven House is ruled by a Matron Mother, while a Matriarch - Usually the Matron Mother of the top House - rules over an entire Dark Elven settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Dwarfs</u><br>\r\n- An ancient, grim, and determined race were integral in the founding of the Empire of Sigmar, the Dwarfs spend their days avenging grudges and counting gold. <br>\r\nDwarfs are the greatest craftsmen in the world and in addition to enjoying fine arms and armour, they implement the best heavy infantry and artillery. Dwarf armies are well suited to defensive warfare, however due to their lack of mobility they do not do well when forced to go on the offensive.<br>\r\nDwarfs are legendary for their ability to never forget or forgive a wrong against them, their finely crafted weapons and armour, ability to consume large quantities of ale, extreme stubbornness, mistrust of elves and hatred for goblins and orcs.<br>\r\nDwarfs are the closest ally to humanity against the goblins, although the Elves of Ulthuan have united with the humans as well in the last few hundred years. Due to the horrid \u201dWar of the Beard\u201d, Dwarfs hold a grudge against Elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Centaurs</u><br>\r\n- The centaurs are a race of highly intelligent, loyal and honorable creatures that are half horse, half human. They appeared human from the abdomen up to the head, while the rest of their body was that of a horse. And they also have ears of a horse.<br>\r\nThey are seen as wise prophets or sages, loyal courtiers and majestic, powerful warriors. They are highly skilled in astronomy and divination, being able to read the stars and tell of future events. They are also proficient warriors and healers.<br>\r\nIt is said in Middle-earth that no one ever laughed at a centaur and that no one who valued his life would ever saddle one (if offered the opportunity). They also have two stomachs \u2014 one human and one equine \u2014 which means they eat quantities of both human and equine food.<br>\r\nCenturies ago, they were nomadic tribes in the steppes east of the Worlds Edge Mountains. But then they were foretold of a great war on the other side of the great mountains, that threatened to destroy the human nations there. And the centaurs decided to come to their aid. That war is known in world history as <b>the Great War Against Chaos</b>, when Norsca, taking advantage of the divided Empire (late Age of Three Emperors), invaded Kislev and laid waste on its cities and besieged the city of Kislev.<br>\r\nHowever the future Emperor Magnus the Pious united it again and marched the imperial forces towards Kislev with their Dwarf allies. And when the battle began, the centaurs arrived to aid the Empire, Kislev and the Dwarfs to victory against the barbaric forces of Norsca.<br>\r\nForever grateful, Kislev and Empire named the centaurs their eternal allies and allowed them to settle and made citizens of their respective nations.<br>\r\nToday, the centaurs of Kislev and the Empire serves as scholars, councilors and soldiers. In Bretonnia, however, few are allowed to settle only to serve as farmers, rangers and shepherds, not soldiers.<br>\r\n(<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://previews.123rf.com/images/warpaintcobra/warpaintcobra1710/warpaintcobra171000016/89113114-centaur.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://previews.123rf.com/images/warpaintcobra/warpaintcobra1710/warpaintcobra1...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Halflings</u><br>\r\n- Halflings, or hobbits, are a race of short humanoids (roughly half a man's size) dwelling primarily in The Moot (an imperial province and one of the main providers of food for The Empire) and various other scattered regions in Middle Earth. Halflings are known for their excellent produce and cooking, but are often discriminated against by other races, particularly humans. It is a common superstition/bias that all Halflings are thieves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Greenskins</u><br>\r\n- The Greenskins are a highly primitive and warlike race of bestial humanoid barbarians and raiders that inhabit this world.<br>\r\nThe term \"Greenskins\" is a common collective description used by many civilised nations to refer to the forces of the Orcs and Goblins and other biologically related races.<br>\r\nThe broadest division is between the Orcs (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Orc_grunt_by_Lucas_Salcedo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Orc_grunt_by_Lucas_Salcedo.j...</a>), who are strong, brutish, and savage warriors, and the Goblins, who are smaller and weaker, but cunning and conniving creatures.<br>\r\nThe Greenskins are considered by many to be the scourge of all civilisation. These tribal warriors are extremely violent, raiding ceaselessly, carrying war and barbarism to all corners of the known world.<br>\r\nTime and again, hordes of Greenskins would arise without warning and lay a great swath of destruction that has no direction or purpose other than simple violence. Indeed, the Greenskin race's single motive is violence, an ever increasing mass of warfare that has the potential to dominate and cover the entire world in a seething green tide.<br>\r\nHowever, the Greenskins' tendency for warfare has created a division within their society that has ensured their race shall never reach such heights. Since the dawn of their history, the Greenskins have been plagued by a never-ending series of civil wars that has consumed millions of their own kind, for such is their desire for battle that Greenskin tribes have been known to fight each other just as much as they fight the other civilized races of the Old World.<br>\r\nThough such strife should spell doom for their race, such are the Greenskins' ability to both survive and thrive in the harshest of environments that they can never truly be exterminated from the face of the world.<br>\r\nWithout the proper knowledge or unity to progress past even the most basic foundations for a civilisation, the Greenskins never seem to amount to anything more than primitive savages living within scattered tribal societies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Ogres</u> - Massive Eastern barbarians who will do any work for gold and will eat anything and anyone. They ride large beasts resembling mammoths and saber-tooth tigers. Since ogres are guided solely by their stomachs, they spread devastation and destruction wherever they go. Ogres are often considered to be a \"neutral\" army, and can end up fighting for any side, they hire themselves out as mercenaries to feed their lust for food. They have a resemblance to humans from the ice age or cave man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Demons</u><br>\r\n- Demons aren\u2019t so much a race as they are manifestations of an idea. Usually this idea resolves around sowing chaos and corruption. They\u2019re inhumanly powerful and fast and typically are adept at magic. They come from the abyss and most of their motivations involve power plays, or simply alleviating their boredom. many of them have the ability to change their form and have the capability to reproduce with just about any race\u2026although they rarely see any use in such a task and can alter their bodies to be fertile or infertile depending on what they wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Beastmen</u><br>\r\nThe Beastmen, sometimes known as the Cloven Ones, the Horned Ones, the Beast of Chaos or even the Children of Chaos are a race of savage mutant humanoids that bear various traits of bestial appearance, such as cloven hooves, muscular human bodies, horned bestial heads and a malign primitive intelligence. Proud of their origins, it is said that they are the descendants of ancient humans corrupted and twisted by the influence of the God of Chaos at the dawn of time.<br>\r\nFrom deep within the twisted forested woodlands of the mainland Middle-earth and beyond, the Beastmen are a violent, war-driven race that seeks only to plague and destroy the civilizations of Mankind. They prey on the weak and defenseless, striking at lonely settlements without warning in a rampage of destruction before disappearing into the protective darkness of their dark wilderness, running away from the dire retribution that fails to follow.<br>\r\nTo the citizens of the Empire, Bretonnia and the other nations of the Old World, the Beastmen have come to represent creatures from a half-remembered age of nightmare. Men deceive themselves that the danger has passed; that they are safe in their walled towns, that their steel and gunpowder, wizards' arts and engineers' creations will hold at bay the lowly beast-things that haunt the woodlands. Men tell themselves that the creatures of the forest are disorganized and incapable of fielding armies that can threaten their crenellated, high-walled cities.<br>\r\nThey are quite wrong. To underestimate the Beastmen is a fatal mistake. The Cloven Ones are creatures of violence and conflict, and they are far more cunning than the Empire believes. Worse still, the more noble and haughty the foe, the more the Beastmen are driven to prove their own supremacy by casting him down from his lofty pedestal and trampling his body beneath blood-encrusted, filthy hooves. As such, these unruly, course and foul creatures would go to war with savage intent, slaughtering the civilized races like cattle, burning down and shattering their homes, and stomping on the remains with their cloven hooves until there is nothing left but devastation and ruin. It is said that so long as Chaos reigns over this world, the Beastmen shall plague the lands of Mankind for all eternity.<br>\r\nThe only places they do not appear are the isles of Albion, the double continents of Narnia, the continent of the Southlands and the island of Nippon. These regions are lucky...<br>\r\n(<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/de/1f/4fde1fa0c537333a049b5dbc3b302720.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/de/1f/4fde1fa0c537333a049b5dbc3b302720.jpg</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Dragons</u><br>\r\n- Dragons are large, intelligent, fire-breathing (or ice\u2026or lightning\u2026or many things other things!) and incredibly dangerous. On top of their brawn and brains, they also have a lot of skill in magic. They start quite small at birth, but can grow nearly indefinitely. The largest of dragons can threaten whole kingdoms with nothing more than their gargantuan size. Fortunately, their greed and lust means that they typically get slain before they can become that large. They often hoard money and and harems and are infamous for it on top of their dangerous nature, they also have the capability to breed with just about anything and can use magic to disguise themselves if they feel like being subtle (which they rarely do). However, unlike demons, they don\u00b4t have an off switch. This means that half-dragons are common in regions infested with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Dragon-kin</u> <br>\r\n- Dragon-kin (or Half-dragons) Aren't exactly their own species. They are the child of a dragon and another (usually intelligent) race. Although really, any person or creature with dragon features are referred to as Dragon-Kin whether they are truly half-dragons or somewhere in between. Dragon-kin retain features of their dragon-ancestry. These features can vary from case to case: full-body scales, patches of scales, claws,vestigial wings, slit eyes\u2026etc. The more dragon blood one has, the more dragon-like their features.<br>\r\n(<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QrWLlwIbgCQ/Uvalsqp9UsI/AAAAAAAAn1Y/XXG5the_cqw/s1600/Dragon+in+armour.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QrWLlwIbgCQ/Uvalsqp9UsI/AAAAAAAAn1Y/XXG5the_cqw/s1600/...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Giants</u><br>\r\n- Living almost exclusively in the north of Middle-earth, and rarely seen anywhere in the southern lands. Giants are a race of powerful, muscular and bearded creatures, having twice the height and girth of ordinary humans (average over 10 feet tall) they are  warlike but also have a fondness for mead and brawling. Only male, Giants are generally unable to reproduce and increase their numbers, giants are said to be born from the cold winds of the north. Giants are generally strong and aggressive and have the reputation of being impeccable fighters. Despite their warlike culture, they too cultivate family and are not without emotions, similar to humans. Their attitude towards other races is somewhat condescending, believing that they are the superior beings, particularly when it comes to strength and fighting. Giants sometimes pair with a female of some other race and produce a Half-giant, a very rare occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-giants generally take the shape of their mothers race but are extremely large, being anywhere from 7 to 8 feet tall with proportional bodies to match. While they are not the same size as their fathers, they inherit almost equal strength. They can be both male and female and any descendants tend to retain some trait of giant blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Faeries</u><br>\r\n- Also known as Fae, they are a collection of magical creatures of the known world: pixies, nymphs, mermaids, satyrs and harpies. The females are always pictured with immaculate skin, perfect bodies and enormous breasts, and the men always muscular and handsome, with noticeable, great manhoods.<br>\r\nIt is believed that some Fae lives in the woods of Albion and waters around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, only 1 in 20 are born male. As a species, the Fae were perilously fearing extinction, and required human men to breed with, in order to keep their hopes alive. But this has caused jealousy from the human women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Vampires and werewolves</u><br>\r\n- Vampires are immortal beings that have spread the loathsome curse of Undeath across the realms of Men for centuries. Though many lineages of this foul race now live in the rain-swept forests of the far north, their true origins lie within the once great civilisation of Nehekhara. The true masters of Undeath; they retain much of their original intelligence and capabilities despite their curse, and hence retain their ambition and desire. This makes them very dangerous indeed, for Vampires, due to their immortality, have an extensive period of time in which to hone their skills and refine their schemes to utter perfection.<br>\r\nThey cannot resist the sunlight and need to feed on blood of the living in order to survive, and they use undead in their armies.<br>\r\nThe last remaining vampires of the world lives in Middle Earth and are known as the <b>Vampire Counts</b>. Most of them rule Sylvania (formerly an eastern province in the Empire of Sigmar), while a few resides in the former Dukedom of Mousillon in Bretonnia.<br>\r\n- Werewolves are people with the ability to shape-shift into a wolf or a wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Some claims to have seen one in Sherweald Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Pegasus and unicorns</u><br>\r\n- Pegasus is a horse with wings and unicorn is a horse with a single horn on it\u2019s head. Pegasus's live in uninhabited areas and the last unicorns in the world lives in secluded forests, including the Andredesweald Forest, which is protected by the knightly House of Wolfsbane.<br>\r\nA few people in the recent years had claimed to have seen a Unipeg, a horse with both wings and horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Hippogryphs and Griffons</u><br>\r\n- A Hippogryph is a hybrid animal that has the head winged features of a predatory bird, the forequarters of a mountain lion and the rear end of a horse, complete with tail. The Hippogryph species inhabit the upper reaches of the mountain range that\u2019s forming the border between the Empire of Sigmar to the east and Bretonnia and the Loren Forest to the west, occasionally prowling the green lands below for prey such as sheep and cattle, although they have also been known to hunt humans, orcs or just about any creature that cannot quickly hide from its vision. Being a predatory animal, Hippogryphs are savage and highly aggressive in their nature and would attack anyone or anything with very little to no provocation or warning.<br>\r\nAs you might expect, the Hippogryphs species are unnaturally bloodthirsty animals who would wantonly slaughter every animal on sight, not necessarily for food but as a simple act of pure aggression. In fact, a Hippogryphs desire for warm flesh is so great that those around them can literally sense their terrible hunger. Survivors of a Hippogryph attack often keep a sharp lookout skywards for years afterwards. They are unrelentingly territorial and will fight to the death against any creature that strays into their chosen domain.<br>\r\n- A Griffon is a combination of a giant bird of prey and a big cat, such as a lion, or tiger. Griffon\u2019s have massive feathered wings, and beaks which are hooked and can easily sever a man\u2019s limb. Their claws, which are reminiscent of a hawk\u2019s talons, are kept sharp by regular scoring against stone.<br>\r\nThey are voracious predators, flying out for miles to hunt from their mountain lairs. Griffons then swoop down on their prey, screaming war cries as they come. The cry of a Griffon is often enough to send enemies running. For the Griffon, this is an ideal situation as it prefers its meals on the run, and alive. They then continue to attack until no opponent is left moving. Survivors of the griffon attacks often have dreams of being hunted down and rent limb from limb for years afterward. Despite being large and monstrous creatures, Griffons have reputations as noble beasts. This is in part due to their proud and regal bearing \u2014 Griffons are not ravenous and frenetic like Manticores (creatures in the underworld). Instead a Griffon strikes with swift and precise grace, its motion poised and controlled. Yet this elegance in no way undermines its deadliness, for a Griffon is more than capable of using its talons and razor beak to rip a foe apart. Skilled and efficient fighters, Griffons do not kill indiscriminately, although they show no reluctance when hunting or protecting their territory. They are fierce and merciless, but never cruel.<br>\r\nGriffons prefer their meat raw and screaming, though they\u2019ll scavenge if no other prey presents itself. This is fairly rare though, as their hunting grounds tend to range for miles around their chosen mountain aerie. Their eyesight is as sharp as raptors and they can see motion from miles away.<br>\r\nAs a result of a Griffon\u2019s possession of a noble temperament and an impressive intelligence, they can be trained as loyal and deadly mounts. For anyone to have the slightest hope of mastering a Griffon, the beast must be capture and trained while young, forging a bond that only death can shatter. Griffons are prized for their sharp claws and powerful beaks which rival <b>Greatswords</b> (elite units of the Empire) in their deadliness.<br>\r\nThe Griffon is a sacred symbol in the Empire of Sigmar which appears frequently adorning temples, chapels and churches dedicated to the Faith. It is no coincidence that the Order of the Griffon was so named. Emperor Karl Franz himself enters battle on the back of <b>Deathclaw</b>, his personal Griffon mount. As well as the empire the High Elves also use Griffons as mounts. Many Griffon\u2019s dwell in the mountains in Ulthuan, where they are more colorful than the ones in Middle-earth, but equally as deadly.<br>\r\nA few Griffons in Albion lives in the southern half of Ynys Wydryn (the Frozen Teeth) in the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Direwolves</u><br>\r\n- A direwolf is a close relative of the wolf, but larger and stronger. They are named after the real world dire wolves (extinct), Pleistocene megafauna, which were larger than modern wolves (but not as large as portrayed here). Direwolves are on the continent of Middle Earth but are near extinct in Albion, as they are a very large and dangerous predator, and people have probably trying to hunt them out.<br>\r\nDirewolves can grow as large as ponies. In proportion to their bodies, their legs are longer and their heads are larger than normal wolves. Their muzzles are also longer and more pronounced. Possible colorations include grey with yellow eyes and black with green eyes. Albino direwolves have white fur and red eyes.<br>\r\nLike other wolves, direwolves are social animals and travel in packs. They are efficient solitary hunters and are extremely intelligent. Left to its own devices a solitary direwolf may join a pack of common wolves and establish dominance over it thanks to its larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There\u2019s a lot of information, but there\u2019s always room for improve and add more. The last thing i want to do is to stifle your creativity. This is hardly a comprehensive guide to Middle-earth and there is plenty of room for more races and lands than just what\u2019s listed here. The things here are listed here, because that\u2019s what has been set in stone through my stories and the stories of other writers. Feel free to come up with new ideas as long as they don\u2019t conflict with the information above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after reading everything you still want to continue. Great! I do have one request though. If you want to add a whole adventure in, try to have good idea of where you want it to begin and end. Inspire your creativity and see it through until the end. I highly encourage anyone who wishes to write a large number of chapters to mail me and we can have a discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can start a parallel story or a whole new story. Chapters that leave off at court, waiting for a crisis or other major event to happen is a great place to branch the story off. Likewise anytime there\u2019s a new ruler or an heir is born is a good time to start a larger story with a new ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you still feel oppressed, I can always use help developing the sexual encounters. I don't have particular confidence in mine and i always feel like they can use more options and interactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, I hope you enjoy reading and i certainly hope things meet everyones expectations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd please, PLEASE add chapters.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(And as usual: reward of 1,000 GPs per chapter)</td>",
