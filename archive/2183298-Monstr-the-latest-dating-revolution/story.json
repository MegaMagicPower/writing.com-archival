Conventional dates weren't really all that fun anymore, but this was on a whole new level. The app held such an impressive variety of options available, humans from across the world and monsters from just about any reality. A few nights of swiping left and right and now a date unlike anything ever tried before was about to start. But who are the lucky ones? Did someone find a monster to date or was it the monster that connected with that special person?</span></div></div>",

He was content enough, but something deep inside him wanted more. When he came across the app he saw it as the perfect way to add some much needed spice to his life. He just hopes that whoever he ends up with mirrors his own calm and collected nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChadwick Tenneville. A 24 year old construction worker and by his own description a 'raging sex bomb'. He's never been in a relation that lasted more than a month and he's never looked at a woman as anything other than some nights of hot sex before moving on. Most of his friends call him Chad and though they won't tell him, he can tell by their faces that they're definitely jealous of his precocious lifestyle. All these rumors that everyone considered him to be a massive douchebag were probably just that, rumors. But after years of chasing after human girls he began to get a little bored with it. He wanted something new and exciting and that's when he stumbled upon this app. He couldn't wait to show these monster girls what they've been missing out on all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl Hessen. A 19 year old blogger and self-styled 'debunker'. He travels all over the country to research the science and hoaxes behind local myths and legends. He had a shot of popularity when he revealed the sightings of a local town ghoul to just be someone in a suit. Since then he's chased more stories than he can count, but nothing managed to rake in the views of that big scoop. Now he's come across this Monstr app and he was eager to blow the lid of this one. A dating app for monsters? There was no doubt in his mind this was all an elaborate prank. He'd invite one of these 'monsters' for a date and carefully record him unmasking them. This would get him the fame he always desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou. It's you. You're mildly jealous of all these other guys getting to date monsters and you want in on the action. Hopefully you don't find yourself in over your head.</span></div></div>",

The two of them have been chatting back and forth for days now and she finally decided to come over. There were so many things he wanted to experience up close with her. The smooth scales on her skin, her cute long muzzle embraced in an intimate kiss. The list goes on. He checks his hair and outfit again for the third time in five minutes. He wanted to make a good first impression at all costs and she said she'd be here at 7, mere minutes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calms yourself by whipping out his phone and looking at the pictures she'd sent. A few cute shots of her face, highlighting her draconic features. A few aerial shots along with the promise that if Matt was real sweet she'd take him for a ride. Though it didn't take much to guess that the ride she was talking about didn't have anything to do with flying. He may feel bad for thinking it, but her messages did make her sound quite eager to get to the action. Not that it mattered too much. Getting to score with a dragon was more than he could've ever imagined himself achieving romantically. He scans the room one last time to make sure everything is perfect for his guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy beat of wings suddenly echoed all around him. Emily was arriving. But if that was the volume her wings could produce he might run into an issue. It now dawned on Matt that in his eagerness to meet her he never quite accounted for her size. Her pictures didn't really have a lot of reference material to suggest her to be anything other than human-sized. It'd be awkward if she had to struggle to fit through the door. More heavy thumps followed, pounding on his nerves. Finally relief as the doorbell rang. Matt straightens himself up one last time before walking down the little hall and swinging open the front door to greet his date. What he saw nearly caused his jaw to hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stood in all her radiant beauty, easily blocking the road and sidewalks with her giant stature. The dragoness wouldn't be able to fit through Matt's door indeed as she was at least twice as tall as his whole house. Her piercing gaze down at her little human date was effortlessly intimidating. Her smile was kind and her features were intoxicating. She was covered from head to toe in a fine pattern of deep red scales, shimmering like rubies. There wasn't a blemish to be seen in them on her whole body. Her leathery wings a faded beige matching the underside of her clawed hands and feet. She stood on all fours like the European dragons he'd seen so often in movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" She said, her voice reverberating with power. He was awestruck at her sheer size and beauty, stammering out a timid hello in return. The dragoness leaned her head in close, her fiery gaze inspecting him thoroughly. She seemed pleased, humming with delight as she spoke to him. \"You're Matt, right? You're precisely what I was looking for.\" She tried to be sweet, but her voice was so powerful it made his legs wobble. He swallows his fears and replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you must be Emily. Pleased to meet you. I was going to invite you inside, but I'm thinking that might not end well for my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's kind of you.\" She said, giggling a little at his gesture. \"It's okay, little guy. How about I take you someplace nice instead?\" She reached her large clawed hand towards him, each of the fearsome talons longer than his leg. With practiced care the thick digits wrapped around him and with a heavy beat of her wings she lifted herself off the ground. The whole experience felt like a dream. The firm grip of her claw, the air rushing by as she flew away with Matt in hand and the pang of fear that settled in once he realized he had no idea where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Matt had no choice but to wait for her to reach her destination. The forests and mountains seemed to stretch on without end. Hopefully this date went well, because there would be no way out of here without her help. Finally she slowed herself a little, approaching a mountain with a large gash in the side. It was the entrance to her lair. By his estimation even the hardiest explorers would need weeks to reach this place on foot. No wonder she'd managed to stay hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily carefully glides down, landing on three feet. Matt shivers as the ground came frightfully close, but this wasn't the dragon's first time bringing something along. The tight grip of her leathery claw dissipates as she gently sets her date down on the ground. The cavern stretching out before him looked strangely well-kept. There was no clear sign of anything living here, but the floor had been smoothed out and the walls didn't quite look natural either. A large tunnel stretched ahead and Emily wandered in, shaking the ground a little with her every step. Matt runs alongside her, struggling to keep up with her casual pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Matt.\" She announces proudly, turning a corner. Before him stretched out a huge cavern. The walls were lined with lights getting their power from who knows where. The ceiling too was adorned with all manner of small lamps tied to the rocky surface. The floor was smoothed, a mesmerizing pattern running throughout the cave. But his attention was drawn almost immediately to her hoard. She'd mentioned it a few times, but she never told him what she hoarded. He always just assumed dragons would all be hoarding gold or other valuables. But Emily had a somewhat... different collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw hits the floor as Matt stares at her hoard of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scurrying all over the expansive cave were men. It didn't take Matt long to notice some eerie similarities. Each of them seemed to have the same shaggy haircut he does. They all also wore roughly similar outfits. Was that why Emily insisted on him wearing this? The red dragon beamed with joy upon looking at her collection. It was always a good day when she found more souls to add to it. Emily loudly cleared her throat, causing all the men in the cave to freeze in their tracks and turn their attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back everyone, and I've got another boyfriend to help you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome forced cheering and a lot of murmuring rose up from the crowd. None of them seemed particularly happy to see Matt arrive. He didn't know what was going on, but he became very nervous. Is this what she had in mind for him? Another slave to add to her hoard? He didn't have to wait long for an answer as the dragoness happily continued her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love this new app. It makes finding suitable boyfriends and capturing them so much easier. And since the hoard has grown so much lately, there's so many new faces around. If you've been here for a while, get back to work. For the newbies, let me explain what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two-thirds of the men went back to whatever it was they were doing. Mostly it seemed they were busy hauling around food to prepare dinner for everyone. One massive plate of various meats, both raw and cooked, for Emily and whatever scraps were left over for them. Matt gulped as he and the other new joiners kept their attention on the towering dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple really. I expect my boyfriends to treat me like the queen I am. That means you'll do everything I say when I say it. I won't tolerate any lip from you and while we're on that subject...\" She trails off as her eyes scan the cave, looking for someone in particular. She walks over to the kitchen and grabs one of them men in a large clawed hand. Her grip was murderously tight, but his crushed lungs wouldn't permit him to scream. He winced uncomfortably as she carried him back to the awestruck men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you disobey me, give me attitude, piss me off or worst of all, <i>steal</i> from me...\" Her grip tightened. Matt was sure he could hear one of the man's bones snap. Suddenly she released her grip and with a large claw tore at his tattered pants. The pockets were ripped to shreds and several glimmering ruby scales dropped out. The man tried to cry out an apology, but Emily was going to make an example out of him. She snatched him up again and brought him to her fearsome maw. Rows of razor sharp teeth glistened in the cave's light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened wide and dropped the man on her squishy tongue. She quickly snapped her jaws shut, her victim pulling his arms on board before she would sever them in a single bite. The dragon didn't care. With or without arms, there was only one place left for this thief. She tilted her head back and with a single mighty gulp she sent him down her gullet. Matt stood there, looking horrified. His date just casually ate a man. Swallowed him whole. As the bulge traveled down her neck and disappeared into her body she looked back down at the frightened men, finally finishing her sentence. \"... I will reduce you to a quick snack, if I don't feel like torturing you first. Now get back to work! Except you, Matt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other men quickly scurried back to their tasks, looking busier than ever to avoid becoming an example too. Emily took a step closer to her date, looming over him with a gleeful smile. She lowered her head down and stared into his eyes. Matt had no idea what horrible plans she had for him, but he needed to be careful if he ever hoped to get back home. Her hot breath washed over him as she intently watched his every jitter. \"Now what should this lovely new boyfriend do for me...\" She mused with a broad toothy smirk.</span></div></div>",

Please don't hurt me.\" He muttered, barely loud enough for the looming dragon to hear. Emily cracked a toothy smile, snorting a bit as she held back a laugh. Her new boyfriend already knew his place it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural...\" She mused, leaning in close and letting her tongue slip from her lips. The slender muscle dragged along Matt's face, leaving a trail of warm drool behind. \"...and you taste just right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gulped. He couldn't begin to guess what Emily had in mind, but being referred to as tasty didn't ease his nerves in any way. He always thought the risks of dating a monster would be some bad body odour or rough manners. How did he ever think it was a good idea to go and date a full-blown dragon. Internally he was kicking himself, but all Emily saw was her date muttering and twitching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute when you're desperate.\" She said bluntly. Matt snapped out of his little tantrum to look up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\" He said, immediately flinching as he feared he'd overstepped his boundaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From you personally? Right now... I think I want pleasure.\" Emily's smile grew wider and she grabbed her boyfriend in a large clawed hand. With big steps she marched through her cave to what seemed like a bedroom. The large doors swung open and Matt's fears were confirmed. It was a bedroom. A separate smaller cave sealed behind a set of imposing metal doors. A large mountain of pillows passed for a bed and the remainder of the room was filled with all manner of heaps. A pile of self-care products with a large pack of humans toiling to keep them sorted. A stack of old clothes, no doubt from other people she'd abducted and gotten rid of. And lastly a small pile of shimmering red scales. The same she took from the thief moments before eating him. It was the closest thing in this cave resembling a dragon's hoard of treasure. Matt wasn't given another second to look around as he was thrown across the room into the large collection of pillows. He screamed all the way, only widening Emily's playful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other humans toiling in her bedroom all dropped what they were doing and scurried for the door. Their master was looking for private time and those that got in her way would meet a swift demise. In under a minute Matt was the only human left in the room, the doors closing with a heavy thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to help pleasure me. Do well and I might let you stay here and recover. Resist if you must, that usually just makes it feel even better for me. And if you're really good, I might feel so generous as to let you return to your boring life. But mark my words: Once you've experienced what pleasures I and I alone can bring you, you'll be begging me to take you back.\" Emily spoke confidently, slowly approaching her date. Matt looked up like a deer in the headlights and gulped. There was no escape. He could only beg her for what little mercy was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... please don't kill me.\" He stammered. Emily paused her approach to laugh, leaning her large head close to her boyfriend and whispering in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't killed anyone with sex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could utter another word the dragon got started.</span></div></div>",

The lustful look in her eyes didn't bode well for him. He tried to get back on his feet, but the small mountain of pillows he was standing on failed to provide a solid enough surface for him to stay up. He fell back down and could only gasp in horror as he witnessed just how forward his date was intending to be with her advances. She stood over him, her large rear turned his way. Looming overhead was her sex. The first drops of her arousal were already leaking from the glistening slit. She only had a narrow ribbon of leathery white scales that formed her underbelly, the only part of her body not covered in radiant scales. Sitting at the very base of that thin strip of white were two puffed up labia, each at least as big as Matt's whole body. Before he had met her, the sight of a dragon's pussy might've aroused him. But now he stared in fear as the snatch slowly lowering itself onto him looked ready to swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his head Matt imagined how different this whole scenario would be if Emily was closer to his size. He might not be fearing for his life right now. But if the sex wasn't going to kill him, would he really be that much better off? As far as he could tell his survival only meant that he could join the hoard of other 'boyfriends' Emily had gathered. And seeing how she treated them, being a part of her collection just seemed like a death sentence with extra work. The despair in his eyes had not gone unnoticed though, as the dragon suddenly paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up, you'll probably be fine. I was only joking before. About the killing you I mean, not the setting you free if you're pleasurable enough part. That's still open for you to achieve. Just wriggle lots in there and I'm sure you'll be fine.\" The dragon tried to be comforting, but the overwhelming nature of the situation made it hard for Matt to draw much solace from her words. Her booming voice didn't help things either. He dreaded to discover what that large pussy would feel like up close and hearing her talk about going 'in there' removed all doubt on what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to go but in, Matt grit his teeth, straightening himself out and preparing to take the plunge. He sat up and reached for the sky, putting his hands together like a diver ready to jump into the pool. Emily smirked naughtily and didn't keep her date waiting another second. She lowered herself down onto him, moaning as she felt his hands slip between her lower lips and into her love tunnel. He tried to maintain his resolve, but seeing that huge pussy fill his vision forced him to let out a panicked scream. Her aim was practiced, insuring she would not accidentally crush him flat beneath her vast body. A sloppy, wet squelch signaled a successful landing, putting a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily huffed and moaned, feeling the little man wriggle inside of her. Even his smallest movements against her sensitive folds were enough to send waves of pleasure through her. \"Oh yes, that's the spot! More! Please, <i>more!</i>\" Her words slurred a little. It didn't matter much anyway, as Matt was in too deep to hear a single letter of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe struggling man had more pressing things to worry about. In an instant everything from the waist up had been engulfed by his date's love tunnel. The slickened walls dragged against him whilst her inner muscles occasionally gripped him, forcefully rubbing her feminine juices into his body and hair. The smell was overpowering, a piercing musk that stank unlike anything else he'd ever smelled. His nose ached from the sheer intensity of it. Strangest and scariest was the uncanny feeling that the inner walls were trying to pull him in deeper. He couldn't tell for sure, his mind and senses hazed by the heavy scent of Emily's arousal, but it felt like more and more of his body was pulled into the slimy, warm embrace of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon cried out with pleasure, her living man-toy providing stimulation in ways only a real man could. No vibrator or dildo came close to the bliss she felt at this very moment. It wouldn't be much longer until~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooh\" Emily moaned lewdly as she rolled around on the huge heap of pillows, scattering them everywhere. Her orgasm hit like a freight train, a river of unfiltered joy streaming from her nethers. It lasted for what felt like an eternity, drenching many of the pillows in sticky slime. She could only imagine what kind of rollercoaster that must've been for her date. Highly satisfied, the dragon slowly regained her bearings and checked up on Matt. </span></div></div>",

She couldn't remember the last time a human was capable of bringing such joy to her day. After this he'd certainly earned his freedom. The dragon rolled onto her side to inspect the state of her date and a broad smirk crept onto her face. Even a climax that intense wasn't enough to dislodge him from her love tunnel. Only his legs dangled limply outside, drenched in her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was carefully pulled free and flopped onto the pillows. He didn't move a muscle, something Emily attributed to him being utterly exhausted from such a wild ride. Maybe she shouldn't have gone at this so quickly. She'd only met the guy today. But he was just one in her hoard of boyfriends. If it wasn't him, another would find himself in the same place. As seconds ticked by she did feel a pang of concern. He hadn't moved at all, but he also didn't gasp for air like some of her other lovers did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt? Hello? Can you hear me?\" Her voice was a little cracked from the intense pleasure, but the concern in it was clear as day. Emily reached in and poked him with one of her sharp talons. No response, not even a flinch. The bitter truth began to creep up on the dragon. She'd ended him for her pleasure. In the heights of her climax she must've drowned him in her juices. Or maybe her inner walls had simply crushed the life from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Emily felt overwhelmed with emotions. There was sadness that Matt was already gone, but it was overshadowed by something far darker. She felt empowered, affirmed in her draconic might. A man had died to bring her pleasure, and that felt almost as good as his writhing inside of her. The dragon's loins burned with renewed eagerness. With a cruel smirk and a seductive voice she asked him a question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling all kinds of ready to go again. Any objections from you?\" The dragon knew the answer already but waited politely for a few seconds in case Matt made a miraculous recovery. Her patience could only hold back her lust for so long though as she grabbed his body and shoved it right back inside of her pussy. The mountain shook with her moans several more times that day as she used up her boyfriend. Each round her powerful inner walls cracked more of his bones until she'd finally had enough, leaving him covered in layer after layer of her juices for her servants to dispose of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such a thoroughly entertaining day Emily could only think of one more thing to do. She opened up her phone, launched Monstr and started looking around for the next addition to her hoard. Hopefully this one would be a little sturdier.</span></div></div>",

They swept past the residential area where Matt lived and over the heart of the city. Something seemed to change in the air, and before long Matt noticed signs of other large creatures flying in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could make out what they were, Matt felt Emily's grip shift, and the two of them swooped downward. The air rushing by roared in his ears, and he couldn't help but feel like he was falling. Thankfully, Emily's sure grip provided a sense of security even as a primal terror gripped Matt. They soon landed in front of an enormous building with an imposing set of doors, though after a moment Matt realized there were several sets of smaller doors set into the main pair that would let creatures of a wide variety of sizes through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily placed Matt gently on his feet, and supported him as he struggled to find his balance. Once he was standing on his own, she asked him in a playful tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the flight?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMatt didn't want to admit that he'd been afraid, and chose instead to say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's got to be the most exciting way I've ever traveled!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily seemed to appreciate that, smiling as she gestured toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, m'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a gentleman!\" Emily laughed as she pushed open the large door and led the way into a foyer decorated with lush plants, beyond which lay an array of candlelit tables. Sharp-dressed waitstaff pushed carts laden with dishes too large for any human, and a variety of monsters sat at various tables, speaking quietly amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily spoke with a host, a black-haired troll with gleaming white eyes and an imposing set of horns. The host looked up her reservation quickly, and Matt realized with a jolt that she must have planned this from the very beginning. When the host asked where the pair wished to be seated, Emily looked at Matt expectantly.</span></div></div>",

It was only a moment before the pair had been led to a spacious booth that was easily the size of Matt's house. Emily gently scooped Matt up with a clawed hand, her grip much lighter now than the first time she had held him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily lifted Matt up to the edge of the table, Matt was relieved to see that the restaurant had accounted for the difference in size between creatures such as Emily and himself. There was a human-sized walkway affixed to the side of the table leading to a comfortable-looking seating area that dipped down below the tables edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Matt walked along the walkway, Emily climbed into the large seat on the other side. She rested most of her body sideways aling the padded seat, allowing her tail to hang over the edge and curl on the floor. The low light of the restaurant booth caused Emily's scales to take on a golden glint as she made herself comfortable. She fixed Matt with another smile when he sat down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made small talk as a griffon waiter, smaller than Emily but still massive by human standards provided them with menus and drinks. Matt talked about his job and desire for something new, while Emily described a fascination with humans, but the trouble she'd had meeting them. Matt still found the dragoness overwhelming, with breathtaking beauty and a terrifying sense of power; but she spoke with a casualness and confidence that made him trust her easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew it, the waiter was back and asking if they were ready to order.</span></div></div>",

It's made from the finest beef. I believe that's the custom in the human world too, right?\" Emily chuckled as her date's face got almost as red as her scales. She gave her own order, a luxurious feast that could feed Matt and his entire extended family for a week. He didn't mind her large appetite one bit. The more she gorged herself now, the less chance there was of him becoming dessert. She might be his date, but the towering dragon still looked like she could snap him up without another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was oblivious to his fears and when the waiter left smalltalk resumed. Matt talked a bit about his friends and family and the dragon had more than a few stories to share as well. One that stood out to him was the tale of Sapphire, a close friend of her and by her description the unluckiest dragon out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she decides it's time to make a name for herself, since she accidentally destroyed the last kingdom she was trying to dominate. Plan's easy enough: Swoop in, grab the princess, take her to lair and bingo, knights and heroes will come to her. She finally gets the attention she deserves and if that don't work, snatch up more of the royal family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sat and listened, no longer feeling unnerved by the casual tone with which the red dragon regaled stories of abduction and murder. There was something empowering about feeling completely outside of the law like her. The confidence with which she spoke was impressive, like this was just how things were supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, few days pass, nobody shows up yet and suddenly some scrawny peasant arrives. She puts on her best intimidation, but the guy explains he's not here for the princess, he's got a message from the king. Turns out the princess was a royal pain in the ass and he sent his thanks to Sapphire for dealing with his problem. So she's so pissed she goes from a blue dragon to a red dragon for a minute, flies over to the king and burns some villages along the way. Grabs the snarky shit right of his throne and nearly just eats him right there. She leaves, hoping the abducted king would spur some action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can see where this is going...\" Matt said jokingly, a big grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, after a week a nobleman arrives to explain that the king was almost as big of a dickhead and if she could please eat them both. She just goes back inside and the only thing the guy hears was her loudly yelling 'oh for <i>fuck</i> sake!'. I mean, it'd be kinda sad if it wasn't so funny. I don't know how she does it, but this happens almost every time. She really has the worst luck. All she ever wanted was the attention of some valiant hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though? Don't those guys usually only try to kill you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily burst out in laughter, her bellowing voice sending a shiver down your spine. \"Hah, you really think their little swords can harm us? Nah, most stories about a hero defeating the foul dragon are a very one-sided retelling. Truth is, we just toy with them for a bit and leave when we're bored. If they survive the toying, they're free to write whatever heroic poetry they want, doesn't matter to us. Honestly, it's just fun to mess with people like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt felt a little nervous at his date's stories. Part of him felt like he was just another guy for her to play around with. By now their food had arrived and they were nearly at the end of their dinner. But Emily still had a surprise in store for him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Aaaaah, that was delicious.\" Emily said with a deep sigh. A small burp followed, making her blush. Matt almost expected to see flames from the dragon, but the intense heat was present all the same. He was thankful to be sitting across from her. Any closer and  that might've done some damage. It was awe-inspiring that even something so casual and small from the dragon could pose such risks. As he kept staring dreamily at her she flagged the griffon to get the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the waiter arrived with a large leather clip holding the bill for Emily and left the pair to serve another table. The red dragon would be paying, since she ordered a hundred times more than the human. Matt tried to be polite and pay for his meal, but he was quickly laughed away as she reminded him she had a literal mountain of treasure at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for today, Matt.\" She said with a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for such an unforgettable experience.\" He replied, making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This restaurant always has the best food around. But if I'm honest, I don't like coming here alone. It makes me feel sort of self-conscious.\" Emily muttered, her voice somewhat hushed. He was surprised to hear this mighty dragon was even able to feel that kind of embarrassment. With the way she radiated power and confidence, it was odd to hear her describe feeling any kind of outside pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of why you're here.\" She continued, her tone becoming more stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Matt asked, feeling his concern mounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've not really got much more use for you.\" She stated flatly, reaching over and grabbing him. Matt let out a shocked yelp, but the dragon's tight grip prevented him from making a scene. She opened the clip again, money already present inside, and placed her date on top. Emily quickly snapped it shut, trapping him up to his neck in the thick, leather binding. Without another word she got up and left, simply abandoning her date as a tip for the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt tried to struggle free, but the magnetic clasp was too powerful. The pressure was overwhelming, but not painful. What did sting was the utter bluntness with which his date had simply discarded him. It shouldn't come as a surprise when she talked so much about using others, especially humans, for her own goals but it hurt all the same. With every passing minute he feared some opportunistic patron or waiter would snap him up and make him into a quick snack. He would soon discover if his fears were true as the griffon approached the table. The man only ended up tiring himself out by the time the waiter arrived. The griffon looked down at the clip with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess you didn't impress the lady. Don't feel too bad, most of her 'dates' end like this.\" His voice was comforting, but Matt still felt very afraid as the griffon popped loose the clasp and grabbed him. The waiter's talons were rough, but compared to the sheer size and strength of Emily's claws a lot more comfortable. The griffon checked the payment, nodding to himself before taking it to the register. He paid little attention to the human in his hand until he'd finished putting away the money. After that, the mythical beast's attention turned fully to the little man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gryphon waiter held Matt close to his face, inspecting him thoroughly. The man could see the gears in his captor's head turn, shivering a little at the possibilities. He was completely at the monster's mercy and he wasn't na\u00efve enough to believe he wouldn't be gobbled up just like that if it felt like it. He stared into those cold, avian eyes for a moment until the tension was finally broken. The waiter looked around, nodding to himself and going to the kitchen. As he walked through the busy kitchen he announced to nobody in particular:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having my break, it's quiet right now. I'll be back in 30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome vague mumbling from the other staff confirmed the gryphon's break and he pushed through another door. There was a small set of offices in the back as well as a break room. Matt was surprised to see the monster walk right past the break room and into a small cubicle all the way in the back. He closed the door and switched on the light. The place was a mess, stacks of paper everywhere and enough unfinished work to make any office worker throw up their hands and quit. The dust on the shelves gave the human the impression that this place hadn't seen active use in months. Until now, that is. The gryphon finally released him from the firm grip of his talons, setting him down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening?\" The man asked, his voice full of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. I want to make a deal.\" He said, catching the little guy off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal? What are you talking about?\" Matt tried to temper his voice, but still sounded irate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you got ditched here and that sucks. But if you help me out I'll fly you home. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you? How is someone my size gonna be able to help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon just let out some incomprehensible muttering before giving Matt a very clear impression of his intentions. He dropped his pants and dragged his talons along his crotch, the tip of his pointed cock poking out from his sheath. The little man's jaw nearly hit the floor. What the hell was this monster planning to do with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll feel huge in your hands...\" The gryphon mumbled awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not going near that thing!\" Matt shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down.\" The waiter hissed back. \"You're lucky I'm even giving you a chance. Most unattended humans end up in someone's belly, so unless you'd prefer taking your chances with the other staff this is your ticket back home.\" He gave his cock another stroke, eliciting more of the fleshy spire to emerge from its den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shuddered to think what foul thoughts were running through the gryphon's mind, but if he spoke the truth then there might not be another way. The chances of another staff member treating him kindly were there, but they could just as easily snuff him out. At least the waiter seemed to want him alive, even if just for this. With some reluctance he probed a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do this, you'll take me home... This isn't some cruel joke where you'll just eat me anyway once you're done with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to trust me...\" The monster gave Matt a lecherous smile.</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to take his chances and try his luck with the other staff. The gryphon might be lying about it all, but if he didn't it would be the death of him. He looked the monster in the eye and nodded begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter let out a dark chuckle, his cock nearly fully erect by now. He'd felt pent up for days and this little man was just what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now give me a hand so i can get over there.\" The man complained. The distance between the desk he was on and the gryphon was far too great to jump. The waiter quickly obliged, grabbing Matt and bringing him to the musky pillar. The man's nose ached from the strong smell. He winced as the monster pressed him into the fleshy surface. Every throb resonated through him and the damp surface stained his clothes. He'd have to burn those back home, there's no way that kind of stench is ever gonna come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to it, little man. If I have to help it might not end well.\" The monster squeezed his victim against his cock tightly, making Matt wince in pain. The man reached his arms as far as he could, but the thick shaft was too girthy for him to wrap around completely. He started rubbing, eliciting a moan from the gryphon. The crushing grip lessened, allowing the man more mobility to reach even more of the sensitive flesh. The musky tower twitched. The waiter wasn't lying about being on edge. Only a few seconds of rubbing at it already felt on the verge of erupting. But Matt knew it would take more than just working the shaft to finish this task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon looked down at his crotch in wonderment as he felt the little man move. He was really trying to climb up? After all that moaning the effort Matt was putting in was commendable. Not wanting to wait until the little man finally reached his sensitive tip the gryphon carefully held a talon under his feet. Matt saw the kind, if horny, expression on the monster's face. He carefully put his feet on the talon and in mere moments was boosted up to the top of the monster's cock. The tapered form let him wrap it into a wide hug, something that proved needed because every twitch shook him around so much more. It was hard for him not to be flung off, but Matt was on a mission to get this over with as fast as possible. The gryphon had to struggle more and more to subdue his moans as the little man carressed his cock in ways he didn't think could feel this good. Those tiny hands made him feel so damn powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt couldn't hold on much longer. He needed to finish this before the throbbing shaft threw him off. He reached up as far as he could and found the beast's slit. He closed his eyes, shutting off his brain as much as he could for the disgusting act he was about to perform. He raised his arm high and plunged it in as deep as he could. Gooey, warm slime covered his arm but there was no time for revulsion. The waiter moaned, the manhood quaking with pent up release. Matt was thrown into the monster's hairy belly, holding on as he watched the fleshy tower spew thick ropes of cum into the air. He was glad not to be anywhere near that. The monster's whole body relaxed, tension dissipating along with the powerful release. The man felt a strange sort of relief himself too. Hopefully this was enough to earn him a way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter sat back in the office chair, basking in the afterglow of a spectacular orgasm. He'd made quite a mess, but nobody ever came into this dusty old room anyways. These stains wouldn't be the first he'd made in here. He'd kept his reservations about the little man's abilities. The monster was entirely ready to eat him if he didn't do a good job. But after this he felt Matt had more than earned his reward. There was just one little problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome, little guy. You definitely know how to handle big guys like me.\" He spoke softly. Matt didn't seem too impressed by the compliment, rolling his eyes. The waiter chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that wasn't quite how you expected your date to end either. But I'm a monster of my word. I'll fly you back home...\" Matt smiled, but the gryphon still had something to add. \"...right after my shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man groaned a little. \"Well, how long's that gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Fine... Not like I have a choice. I'll wait.\" Matt's frustration was clearly present, but the gryphon's mind was elsewhere already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to hide you until then. Can't have one of the others finding you and chowing down on you. Oh, I know. I've got just the place.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt grumbled a little as the gryphon grabbed him. The monster's large talons wrapped around him tightly, carrying him away from the soft-furred lower half of his belly. He even got to watch as the wilting cock withdrew into it's sheath. The tip was still messy and leaking, but the waiter seemed in a hurry to retract his manhood. Once only the narrow tip still peeked out from the furred pouch Matt was alarmed to see it come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there you'll be safe and warm. Just don't wiggle too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you crazy? Just put me in your apron or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't risk having you slip out and hurt yourself, Matt. This place is dangerous for unattended humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they might run into monsters that want to shove them up their dicks!\" Matt shouted back angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter wouldn't hear another word of protest, squeezing the little man to silence him and bringing him right up to the musky sheath. The pervasive stench irritated Matt's nose, but it would be nothing compared to what was awaiting him inside. The gryphon grunted with pleasure as he pushed the squirming man in head-first. There was no resistance against the overwhelming force pushing the human inside the damp cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt could feel the smooth surfaces around him. Both the inside of the sheath and the flaccid manhood it contained were damp with slippery slime. The stink of the monster's last orgasm hung heavy in the air. The waiter busied himself with wiping away the mess on his belly, ignoring all the streaks of white he'd leaked onto the office floor. He saw the little man still stuck in his position, two little legs still squirming outside. With a lewd moan he helped the last of the man into his sheath. Already he could feel his manhood stir, but he couldn't have the human causing trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen closely, Matt. I don't want you trying to get me into trouble by giving me a boner. Just hold still and everything will be fine. But if you go wriggling around like that I will get hard and I will let nature take its course. And if you're wondering what that means, picture yourself trapped in there whilst my growing cock slowly crushes you to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Don't give me a boner.' Says the guy that shoved me in with his dick!\" Matt snarked back, but his words were muffled by the musky pouch holding him. It was no use. Even flaccid the gryphon's manhood was too heavy to move around. Climbing out would probably arouse his captor too much and even if he succeeded the waiter would almost certainly capture him immediately. It irked the man that the gryphon hadn't even considered stashing him somewhere in this little office. By his own admission nobody ever came here. But as even his slightest twitch seemed to send a shiver of pleasure down the beast's whole body it became clear for the man that this had as much to do with his safekeeping as it did with the waiter's enjoyment. He let out a weary sigh. This wasn't even the first time today he'd been used as a sex toy. Hell, counting being stood up earlier it was the third time he was used by a monster in the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's world shook as the waiter got on his feet. He dusted himself off and straightened his outfit, trying to hide the last few hints that could've alluded to his actions in the office. Jerking off during breaktime wasn't strictly forbidden, but the others tended to frown on it. But how could the waiter ignore the opportunity provided by this desperate lost human? He felt the odd tingle from his crotch, but nothing that would be a cause for alarm. The next two hours practically flew by, the monster's thoughts frequently wandering off to his little passenger. Finally his shift was over. The waiter changed into his casual clothes, not mentioning a word of the little human to the others. Everyone else had already left when the gryphon slowly coaxed the slime-covered Matt from his sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was exhausted, beaten down by the intense smell and warmth he'd been marinating in for the last two hours. The waiter gave him a vague smile before stepping outside. With a powerful beat of his wings he launched himself into the air, holding his little friend tightly in his left talon. Finally the man spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster smiled and replied.</span></div></div>",

Did he expect a pat on the back for being honest? He did follow it up with a question. \"So uhm... where is your place exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave the monster his address and the waiter nodded. The man didn't question how his ride already knew his neighborhood. Emily had flown for a good while before arriving at the restaurant, it couldn't be close. \"So you're actually just gonna fly me home? No catch at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't you trust us monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, but my monster date stood me up and left me in the middle of nowhere, so I had to resort to giving out handjobs in exchange for getting back home. Just saying, I've not got the best track record for monster trust.\" The man snarked, making the gryphon laugh out loud. At least Matt's sense of humor was still alive and well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll find a way to make it up to you or something.\" The monster added awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, maybe you can talk some sense into my annoying neighbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got one too? Some things never change.\" The gryphon lamented, sympathizing with the little man in his talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, asshole complains if so much as a pin drops in my house. He's constantly harassing me about the smallest squeak. I'm pretty sure he makes half of it up just so he can get in my face and be a dick about it. I've tried to get him to stop, but nothing I say or do ever seems to get through. Maybe a building-sized monster could convince him to leave me be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that, those types of neighbor don't listen to anyone, human, monster or otherwise.\" The gryphon gave Matt a nod and a smile. As they rocketed through the sky Matt began to recognize parts of the skyline. They'd been in the air for what couldn't have been longer than half an hour and already they were at the city limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, you're a lot faster than her.\" He remarked with surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she took the scenic route to impress her date.\" The gryphon mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean her meal ticket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't feel too bad, man. You could've ended up in her belly along with the food.\" The monster tried to cheer the man up, but Matt wasn't feeling too happy after everything that happened today. Minutes later they soared over his neighborhood and the waiter loosened his grip just enough to let Matt free an arm to point out his street and his house. They landed in front of his house. The tight clench of the beast's talons finally opened up completely. Matt didn't mind being held tightly as they flew. Rather that than risking him falling. His steps were a bit shaky after being handled by monsters for so long, but soon after he found his footing. Before he could walk away though a talon stopped him. He turned to see the waiter blushing awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... uhm... before you go, let me give you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was immediately apprehensive, worried the monster would demand more degrading tasks. Instead he was caught off guard as the beast fished a small scrap of paper from his pack and wrote down a number on it. He handed the scrap to Matt, who saw a phone number scribbled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my number... In case you ever want to... You know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spend more time with your dick? Sorry, but that's not my kind of thing.\" Matt threw up his hands, not wanting to give the waiter the wrong impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? You seemed awfully familiar with how to handle it.\" The monster chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was terrified you'd kill me otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon scoffed. \"Nah, you went out on a date with a <i>dragon</i>, you don't scare that easily. Look, just think it over and who knows where it'll go, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. He gave a half-hearted nod to the monster. He didn't see any merit in building a friendship with someone who only seemed interested in using him as a toy. But he wasn't about tell the gryphon that. The last thing he wanted was for the waiter to change his mind and abduct him anyway. He was finally able to walk back home as he heard the beast's heavy footsteps pace over to the house to his right. Apparently the gryphon wasn't kidding when he mentioned talking to the annoying neighbor. The man entered through his front door, but what he heard outside sent a chill down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are y~ Oh my God! AAAaaa-...\" His neighbor screamed before a wet crunch followed. The waiter had undoubtedly unleashed all that pent up frustration from his own annoying neighbor. Loud gulps followed. Matt had never been more curious, but he decided not to look. Ignorance is bliss and all that. From outside the waiter's voice rang one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solved you neighbor problem.\" He said cheerily. Shortly after that the heavy flap of wings fading into the distance let Matt know that this ordeal was finally over. He closed the door behind him and went straight to the bathroom. The next hour would be spent cleaning himself of the horrors he'd been left to stew in for hours. Today had been distressing to say the least. At first his date with a dragon seemed to go alright, only for her to leave him stranded. Then this pervert of a waiter flies him home, but only after jerking the guy off and spending two hours stewing in his sheath. Was this normal for monsters? He seemed to have no issue doing any of this at work. It made him wonder what the dragon would've done if she brought him to her place. Maybe being stood up was a blessing in disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days pass...</span></div></div>",

Being stood up like that had sapped his desire to date more monsters, at least for a while. All of which served to add to his surprise when a large shadow darkened his house. He looked up from his book in surprise. The shadow passed but Matt had a sinking feeling he was about to be part of another monster adventure. He hoped it was all just a figment of his imagination, but moments later his doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpf, let's get this over with.\" He sighed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opened his front door and before him towered Emily. The large red dragon looked imposing as ever, but her expression was far less confident than before. They hadn't exchanged a word since their date. Given how she'd used him, he didn't expect to ever see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... hi?\" He stammered, unsure what his visitor wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Matt...\" She said with a sigh. Before he could ask what she was doing the dragoness continued. \"I just wanted to say... I'm sorry for what happened earlier. It was rude of me to just discard you like that. I... I felt bad about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess there's a first time for everything, right? You, feeling bad for a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a twinge of anger in her eyes, but it melted away as she let out a resigned sigh. Hot breath washed over the man as she had to admit he was right. \"Yeah, I deserved that one. Look, I'm not used to this whole dating thing. Usually the humans that 'accompany' me are just random strangers I grab off the streets. But you... You're someone who specifically sought out a connection with me. And more importantly, through the app I sought a connection with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave her a puzzled look, making Emily huff a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not good at this sappy emotional stuff. Bottom line is I wanted to apologize to you for my actions. I shouldn't have left you behind in that restaurant and I was hoping I could make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man wasn't sure what to say. A full-blown red dragon was on his doorstep apologizing to him. He could tell this was fresh territory for Emily and he almost wanted to reach out and soothe her. But she might just take offense to that and burn him to a crisp. Instead he waited for her to take charge and soldier on with her apology. She did so by producing a tiny satchel and handing it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, a little token from me to you.\" She said. The small bag was surprisingly heavy. Matt opened it up to find a handful of coins and jewels inside. These must be worth a fortune. Those rubies alone looked like they were worth more than his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... Thanks.\" He stammered, shellshocked by the great wealth she'd so casually given him. But Emily wasn't quite finished yet.</span></div></div>",

It was hard to place where it came from precisely, but it distracted him just long enough send a shiver down his spine. \"I don't need this, I got a hot babe waiting to meet big Chad...\" He mumbles to himself, turning his attention back to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f...\" He stammers as he suddenly sees another figure standing behind him in the mirror. She was roughly as big as Chad, but her skin was a deep purple and she had two short black horns growing out of her head. A slim tail could be seen whipping around behind her. But what stood out most was her outfit. She made strippers look modest, wearing a few strings and scraps of cloth held together by little more than wishful thinking. It did nothing to hide her enormous rack. But even with those beauties staring right at him he couldn't muster more than a shocked yelp at seeing them suddenly appearing in his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps around to look at the intruder directly, but the room was empty. Was his mind playing tricks on him or did this girl put a spell on him already? Suddenly something grabbed his shoulder and Chad nearly jumped out of his skin. Leaping away from the mirror he looks back to it to see the girl step through it like it was a portal. She giggles loudly and reaches out her purple hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, I'm Lily. Are you Chad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scrabbles back onto your feet, refusing to take her hand until he's back up again. Finally he shakes it, trying his best to look charming. \"Hey babe, that was one hell of an entrance. You shoulda told me you would come through the mirror, could've cleaned it real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins from ear to ear. The cocky ones were always more fun to play with. She spoke softly, her words sweet as honey. \"So Chad... what convinced you that dating a demoness from the circle of lust was a good idea? Or was that just 'Big Chad' that swiped right?\" She shot a salacious look at his crotch before looking him in the eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... I wanted to date someone that could keep up with me...\" He stammers, still trying to sound cool. Finally recovering from the initial shock of standing in front of an actual real succubus Chad gives her a sly smile. \"Think you could handle a challenge like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, you've got no idea of the things I 'handle'.\" She scoffed, widening his smile further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I love a woman with confidence. Always like to see them sputter and tap out.\" He adds, thrusting his hips. Lily didn't dignify that statement with a response and just laughed loudly. She then put on her most serious glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay big man, you think you're all that? How about a little challenge then? If you can make good on your claims and prove too much for me to handle tonight I'll let you visit the circle of lust. You can make your every lewd desire a reality with no consequences. No act too perverse and an unlimited supply of demons ready to join in at your beck and call.\" Chad's eyes widened at the mere thought of such a reward. Lily raised her finger. \"But. If I can handle everything you've got and still ask for more, you're coming with me to the circle of lust to be my boytoy for a month. It'll be mostly the same, only I will be in charge of what happens to you.\" Her long slim tail cracked like a whip. He'd never felt this aroused in his life. She held out her hand, waiting for his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" He said proudly, shaking her hand. Lily smirked, whispering under her breath. \"Like stealing candy from a baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you want to start by ordering some food, maybe cozy up a little? Or shall we get straight to action?\" Chad offers. The succubus ponders her options for a moment.</span></div></div>",

He only graduated high school a year ago, but instead of all of those sheep who went off to college to get suffocated in debt, he had built a huge internet following with his Deadman\u2019s Debunked brand; what was once an urban exploration Youtube channel, where he and his high school friends stupidly and dangerously did urban explorations in dilapidated and crumbling \u2018haunted\u2019 hospitals, prisons and the like, had turned into a paranormal debunking channel after he unmasked a local ghoul to be a disgruntle school janitor. With the catapulting popularity of his channel he capitalized on it by shifting his content more towards paranormal debunking, whether he was traveling with friends to haunted and paranormal locations, or debunking paranormal tv shows from the safety of his \u2018studio\u2019 (aka, apartment bedroom). Still, the ad revenue he was generating was quite impressive for someone for his age and he couldn\u2019t complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis week started like any other, he was hunched over his desk, looking through his notebook filled with video ideas, from making fun of witches and wiccans, to debunking SCP and cryptid sightings. Carl ended up scrolling through some paranormal internet forums until he came across a chat-thread entitled \u201cNew \u2018Monstr\u2019 dating app hits mainstream platforms, says you can date real monsters! Bogus or Real?\u201d. Carl scrolled through the thread that almost unanimously said it was stupid, with a few users egging others on to download the app and try to get laid with a harpy. This new app would be easy pickings for Carl. He\u2019d get a great series of videos out of him dating the various \u2018monsters\u2019 on the app. At best they were just normal people and at worst adamant, socially awkward cosplayers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl quickly downloaded the app and started writing some scripts for his new videos based on the app. Once Carl opened the app for the first time he noticed a screen that asked him to distinguish himself as a human or monster. He filled out all of the appropriate personality traits, physical descriptions and interests before looking for a match. Soon the app created his profile and brought up a list of female monsters in his area looking for a guy like him. These profile pictures for these monster chicks were fairly convincing\u2026 then again, photoshop can do wonders. There were a few that caught his eye quite a bit. There was Palisades, a western dragoness with turquoise scales, a fit physical physique and a similar interest in video games. There was Mandy, a kitsune woman deeply into spirituality who works as a local healer and nurse. And there was Katrina, a vampiress, who loves horror movies and humans who aren\u2019t afraid to share a coffin with her. There were still a few more pages worth of monster matches, but will Carl continue to look for a supernatural date or pick one of these lovely ladies?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carl's curiosity couldn't be held back any more after reading through Mira's profile. Someone had gone through a lot of effort with this and it was a prime opportunity to debunk something for views. He started chatting with this spider and was quick to discover that whoever was behind this was willing to go all the way. 'She' spoke like many other girls, albeit with occasional grisly details like talking about devouring a deer in the forest. After a few days a date was agreed upon. For obvious reasons she didn't want to show herself near any human spots. People were afraid enough of spiders as is, one of her size would cause a panic. Carl chuckled and played along, agreeing to meet her near her home in the forest. Not a word was mentioned about him making a video about this date, as he didn't want her to get cold feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe packed his recording equipment, already having a plan of action for this. Going by the photos on the profile, this beast would have to be the size of an elephant. There was no real way of recreating that with animatronics or an elaborate suit outside of involving a whole movie studio. So their tactic was probably to scare him so badly that he would turn tail and run before he'd get a chance to reveal that it was all fake. He'd been there before and it made for some of his most-watched videos. Staring down the horror and pointing a camera at it for a few seconds would often have the illusion come crashing down, followed by some folks either scurrying off or getting belligerent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of his head one scary thought did crop up. What if she was the real deal? Carl wasn't afraid of spiders, but one that big would definitely give him pause for thought. Nah. It was biologically impossible for a spider to be that big. He couldn't remember exactly why, but he's certain he watched videos about why bugs aren't bigger these days. Despite all that there was a noticeable pang of dread in his gut as he drove to the forest. What if he really had stumbled upon the genuine article? He laughs it off, parking at the forest's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a camera in one hand and his phone showing directions in the other Carl sets off. The coordinates she had given him guided him along a narrow trail only a few hundred meters into the forest. Dusk was already setting in and the trees around him seemed to get spookier by the minute. He shook his head, trying to stay focused on his recording. Any moment now there'd probably be an elaborate jumpscare and shortly thereafter Youtube gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dim light ahead and the forest cleared. Carl was as ready as he'd ever be. Several trees were covered in large webs, the strands glistening in the fading light. Smaller branches had been partially snapped to further give the impression that something huge had done this. It was a very impressive effort he had to admit. But the one thing yet unseen was Mira herself. Were they hoping this scene alone was enough to send him running? They'd have to do better than a well-dressed stage to scare him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A lot of work had gone into making this little glade look like the home of a giant spider, but what stood out most to Carl were the webs draped all over the trees. They shimmered and glistened just like oversized spider string would. He struggled to imagine how the people behind this trick managed to get them all the way on top of these trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here, but so far not a giant spider in sight. But if you look closely, you'll see that these webs are just made of clear rubber or some other plastic. They look super real, but that ain't gonna fool me.\" He spoke to himself, commenting for his video. He walked up to the most central tree, eager to demonstrate his cleverness. He grabbed one of the thick threads of webbing and raised an eyebrow. \"They've even covered the lower webs in some sort of slime to simulate the stickiness. I'm impressed.\" He chuckled haughtily. He'd seen through this illusion with ease. But when he tried to pull his hand free the webbing barely yielded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Glue?\" Carl's voice gained a tinge of panic as he tried to maintain his composure for the video. Right now it felt like a prank gone wrong. He tried to let go of the sticky strand, but his hand was stuck. Thinking fast, the man puts his camera down and grabs his pocketknife to cut himself free. But the webbing proved immensely tough. The blade struggled to cut through it and Carl was getting visibly upset. He'd probably have to go to a hospital to get this shit removed from his hand. If he ever found out who was behind this sick joke he'd have some very pointed words for them. He grumbled, cutting through the strand on the other side of his hand. He was nearly free when he slipped, the knife flying from his hand and his arms getting caught in several more strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" He cursed, trying to free himself. But at this stage he was hopelessly trapped. His camera was still on the floor, pointing up and recording. \"Well, whatever sick bastard came up with this had better come on out before I take this to the fucking police!\" Carl shouted into the trees, his temper fractured. His blood ran cold when he heard an ominous hiss in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned his head as best he could, restrained in the sticky webs. From the corner of his eye he could see something large moving. Heavy taps on the floor came closer. The fading light of dusk made it hard to see but the long, chitinous limb approaching him was clear as day. Carl fought hard not to panic, holding on to his beliefs that this was all some elaborate trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like 'Mira' is finally here. Maybe 'she' can help me get out of this crap.\" He joked. But the limb did actually seem able to cut through the thick strands with ease whilst not getting caught on them. One arm was freed, but instead of releasing the other she pushed her date around, shoving his back into the webs, flipping him over so he could see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's heart skipped a beat as he looked straight into the eight unmoving eyes of a gigantic spider. Her huge body covered in a rigid brown carapace. Elaborate markings covered most of her. Some might have even been drawn on as her version of make up. Her jaws moved intricately, large fangs gleaming right in front of him whilst all the other twitchy little parts dripped with some sort of saliva. Every detail was there. From the tiny scratches and scuffs on her exoskeleton to the strange bobbing and moving of her body. More and more the thought began to intrude that this might not be a trick. Maybe, against all odds, he really was looking at a spider the size of a bus. And he was caught in this monster's web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well... You must be my date. Carl, isn't it? Do you call all your potential girlfriends 'elaborate tricks' before you've even introduced yourself, or was I just lucky?\" She spoke bitterly. Carl's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull as he struggled to grasp that this huge spider just talked to him. Worse yet, she didn't seem very pleased with his commentary so far.</span></div></div>",

'Ooooh, she's a giant spider, she must be fake.' Meanwhile every pair of tits on that damn app gets ten times the attention, no matter how little sense it makes.\" Mira grumbled loudly, saliva splattering in Carl's face. With the hesitation in his voice hidden as best he could, the trapped man finally stammers out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you better be sorry. You know what happens to humans that get lost in the woods and never seen again? <i>I</i> happen to them and right now I'm tempted to let you experience firsthand what happens next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Please don't eat me...\" Carl blubbered, trying not to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what might be a pang of guilt in the sad looking man Mira leans back. She takes a deep breath before swaying forward, her face closer to him than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's try this one more time. I want you to be completely honest with me. Now that you know I'm really a giant spider and not some prank gone wrong... Would you still go on this date? Or did you only text all those sweet things to me to get a video out of it? You're probably in over your head at this point, so I'll begrudgingly understand if you're scared off by all this. I'll be sad about it, but I'll take you to the forest's edge if you'd rather go home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze was unflinching, but somehow Carl could see the disappointment in her eyes. Was he really the only one that had reacted to her? All this time he thought he was chatting with some pranksters. He remembered some of those messages. And now the girl he'd sent them too had to learn now that he wasn't serious about them... In spite of being trapped in her web, he couldn't help but feel sorry for the giant spider. She made her existence in these woods sound really lonely. And he'd gone and made her feel even more undesirable, writing her off as a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit though that she was completely right about one thing. He was in over his head in ways he couldn't imagine. Faced with the thought of actually having to go on a date with a spider the size of a bus and the risk of being eaten very real and present. He wanted to lie to her and say he was okay with it, mostly out of guilt. But honestly, her offer of letting him walk out seemed tempting too. She wanted him to be honest with her, but he didn't want to risk hurting her feelings even more. Should he put up with this date just to save his skin? His inner conflict boiled over until Mira finally interrupted his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... what will it be? Are you willing to give this date a chance or is it better for us to part ways?\"</span></div></div>",

He spoke as clearly as his fear let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm fully honest, you're right. This went to places I couldn't have imagined and I never thought I'd be facing a real spider of your impressive size. I'm struggling to imagine what a date between us would look like. What can I even offer you romantically? So I don't think it'd be fair to you for me to keep pretending like a date is a good idea. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.\" He let out a weary sigh afterwards, feeling a burden slide off his shoulders. Now he could only hope Mira would honor her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed too, lifting a slender leg and swiping it towards the trapped man. Carl let out a panicked yelp before realizing he was unharmed and the webs binding him were cut loose. Some of the sticky silk still clung to him, but at least he could move again. The giant spider turned around and pointed at a narrow trail amidst the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. That path will lead us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't need to be told twice and with a brisk pace they set off. His nerves were still tingling, the man trying to keep his composure as her heavy footsteps thundered around him. Even eight legs did little to mitigate the weight of her step. After a little while he slows down and turns to her. Hesitantly he asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I really the only one to contact you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Mira snaps back, pausing before she elaborated. \"We aren't exactly sought after by monsters outside of our own species. And humans tend not to want to hang out with even tiny spiders, so ones that could eat them like snacks probably aren't the most desirable either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man felt even more ashamed. He'd really gotten her hopes up only to reveal that he thought this all to be an elaborate prank. When the forest began to thin out and the edge approached he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" Mira asked curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to be lonely tonight because of me. A date might be a bit much, but would you be willing to just... hang out for a bit? Maybe get something to drink?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If the giant spider had eyebrows they'd be raised by now. She still wasn't fond of the little man that had tricked her, but he seemed genuinely regretful of what he'd done. Not many humans would even contemplate an offer like this, especially to someone like her. It tickled her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind. Alright, little morsel. But I think it's better I pick a place to get these drinks. I don't think many human bars are gonna serve me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, only because you'd be able to down their whole supply and only feel a little buzzed.\" Carl jokes back. She chitters in a way he'd not heard before. Was that a laugh? The giant spider calmed down and with a cheery voice she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna put you on my back though, otherwise it'll take forever to reach this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl tried to remain calm as two long limbs extended towards him, taking hold of his torso and lifting him off his feet. The idea that a spider of all creatures had this kind of strength over him was terrifying. But he made a promise and Carl Hessen is a man of his word. He was set down on top of her large abdomen. It was covered in thick spine-like hairs, which he grabbed hold of. Mira set off into the woods towards her destination. He could scarcely believe how fast this monster could run. The trees seemed practically non-existent in her path as she effortlessly scurried over and around them. Before long an exceptionally large tree began to poke out from the forest's canopy. He was surprised to never have seen it before. But by now he was also deep into the forest. When he looked around he realized that there wasn't even the most distant glimmer of light of any city to be seen. There was a strange beauty to just how far removed from civilization he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira arrived at the base of the tree, revealing that it was a large gathering spot for all manner of mystical forest creatures. A few of them gave her a polite wave. Carl was awestruck, timidly waving back. Before today he'd thought oversized animals like Mira were a trick, but now he was surrounded by them. Mice the size of horses, a deer as tall as a house. Several fox spirits lounging in a corner busily chatting with eachother. Numerous half-animals like centaurs, harpies, nymphs and more everywhere. Surrounding the base of the tree was a bar, staffed by satyrs. It looked grown out of thick vines, topped with flat river stones for a fitting natural aesthetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual?\" One of the bartenders asked the giant spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it a double. And a tiny one for my friend.\" She pointed a long limb up at the human on her back before picking him up and setting him down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satyr leaned over the counter to the little man. Though the bar was small for someone the size of Mira, it still stood too tall for the human to even look over the counter. The bartender spoke an eldritch command and gave him a smile. Suddenly vines sprung from the ground, forming a seat beneath Carl and lifting him up. It shaped into a bar stool, even adding steps for an easy way down later. The man was impressed, giving a thankful nod. The bartender responded by putting a mug of ale in front of him. A large minotaur bartender came around to put a large vat of beer down for Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers.\" Carl said, raising his drink. Mira responded in kind before downing the entirety of the vat in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second vat was already on the way as the man tried his own brew. It tasted very sweet, distinct notes of honey and fruit tickling his palate. He saw the bartender nod knowingly at him, the joy in his face clear to read. He turned his attention back to the giant spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know spiders were so fond of beer.\" He joked. He'd not even gotten halfway through his drink before Mira had downed the second vat, ordering another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, there's a lot you humans don't know about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chat back and forth about their lives. Mira has a few hearty laughs as he explains his occupation. Listening to the stories of fake monsters being uncovered and how clumsy some of these illusions were. In return she regaled Carl with all the times she'd subtly guided lost wanderers back to civilization. She also guided many into her belly, but she left that part out. After some time and more beer the two finally felt done at the bar. </span></div></div>",

I'm no stranger to heartbreak, but there aren't many humans out there that would do what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't mention it.\" Carl blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cards on the table, I really thought about eating you back there. That tasty little body of yours in my jaws...\" She salivated a little at the idea, oblivious to the now very nervous looking man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was desperate to spin this story away from her eating him before she got any ideas. \"I think you've had quite enough to drink. Maybe we should be heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmyeah, any more and the hangover will be monstrous.\" Mira said, chittering at her own pun. She paid their tab, Carl's part of the bill barely a fraction of hers. She then leaned in towards the human, her beery breath washing over him. He tried to shuffle away on his seat, but she just got closer until her weird looking spider mouth bumped against his cheek. It was the weirdest kiss Carl had ever experienced. He prayed to whoever would listen that this was just a kiss, especially after her talking about eating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna head out then. I'll see you around, Carl.\" She said, standing up and skittering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira! Wait!\" Carl shouted after her, but the drunk giant spider didn't hear him. The man gulped. He'd just been left here, with no way back to civilization. Suddenly it felt like all eyes were on him. A lost human, helpless and alone. More than one of the patrons gave him a predatory leer. He dreaded to think how many of these people made a meal out of humans like Mira did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, looks like you're stranded.\" The barkeep mused aloud with a sly grin. He poured Carl a pint and put it down in front of him. \"Here, this one's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Carl replied, taking the drink and sipping on it. Hopefully Mira would realize what had happened and return. But as the minutes ticked by it became increasingly unlikely. There would be nothing else for it. He was going to have to find his way home and he would need to rely on the strangers around him for help. He was too deep in the woods to ever make it back alone. But which of these spirits and half-animals could be trusted? Some looked as likely to guide him into their belly as they did to guide him back home.</span></div></div>",

A large bear woman licked her chops and gave him a big toothy grin when their eyes met. The man blushed a little. She looked ready to take him with her... in her belly. Probably best to skip her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tables over a gruff looking centaur chugged down a small keg of ale. He seemed kind of lonely, sighing deeply as his drink emptied. The handful of empty kegs near him getting another member added to their ranks. His whole body was chocolate brown with a few stray spots of white. He looked capable of getting him home, but Carl had heard all kinds of stories about what centaurs got up to in the woods. With so many different versions of them it was hard to tell if he would be a benevolent forest spirit or the brutal molest-all-humans type. It was risky, but at least he didn't look so eager to do strange and possibly awful things to anyone as the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly Carl's attention was caught by a pair of what can best be described as fox ladies. They were human-sized, but their heads looked distinctly vulpine. Narrow, tapered muzzles, a fiery orange fur coat matching the rest of their bodies. Behind each them swished a big, poofy tail. They chittered back and forth, occasionally shooting him a glance and bursting into giggles. When he caught one of them stealing a look she turned her head and winked at him.</span></div></div>",

They looked even prettier up close. Their piercing eyes and pointed muzzles were strangely cute. Most other days he would've thought sitting opposite literal fox women would be weird, but after what happened with Mira he had to accept that this was really possible. They both wore matching short skirts and a cute little top that provided an unsubtle and generous look at their breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, Carl. I'm Katja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Suzie.

We help lost souls to find their destination. And you sound pretty lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really? That's great. I can pay you for your troubles if you~\" Carl reached for his wallet but Katja interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless that wallet has gold in it, don't bother. Your paper money has no value here. Also, we only guide souls I'm afraid. You look a bit too much on the living side for us to help you.\" She smirked. He knew she wasn't being completely honest, but he was way too far out of his depth to even begin to guess what part of her words was false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you could say hi to Matroska over there. She's been looking at you like she'd love to take care of that scrumptious little body of yours.\" They giggled as he shot a glance over his shoulder, only to see they were talking about the bear woman. She blew him a kiss and a big wink. It was unnerving, almost as much as hearing the foxes describing him as 'scrumptious'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you make an exception just this once? Please?\" Carl pleaded, giving the foxes his best impression of puppy eyes. They giggled loudly before Katja let out a long performative sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellllll, I guess we could try to help him, what do you think, Suzie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose we could...\" Her words lifted Carl's mood right away. \"...for a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Carl's turn to sigh. He should've seen this coming a mile away. Of course the fox ladies would be tricksy, but they still sounded like they were his best bet. Hopefully this wouldn't cost him too much. For now the best path was to play along with them. He looked at them pleadingly and spoke up. \"But I've got nothing to pay you with. My cash is worthless here according to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed for a moment before Suzie explained. \"Silly man, we know you're broke. We weren't talking about money. In order for us to do you this favor, you will have to do us a favor too. And I don't know about you, Katja, but I can think of a few things already.\"</span></div></div>",

He wonders why these two seem so enamored by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... It's so... smooth.\" Katja reached out and put a dainty hand on Carl's chest, making him giggle a little. The fur on her fingers tickled his skin. She was mostly correct in her observation. Bar some barely visible peach fuzz on his chest his body was devoid of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kat, you can't just feel up the human like that...\" Suzie chided, but her playful smirk belied different intentions. \"...not without offering him something in return.\" She added. taking hold of one of Carl's hands and putting it on her chest. The man blushed brightly as she seemed to invite him to fondle her tits. Not wanting to overstep his bounds, he held the soft-furred breast in his hand, only rubbing it ever so gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should take this someplace a little more... private?\" Carl suggested, but the fox ladies wouldn't hear any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get shy now, Carl. This is nothing compared to what usually goes down here on a busy night. So long as we don't break anything we could fuck on this table, here and now.\" Katja cooed with a seductive voice, making the man's face turn beet red. She made it sound like they were only minutes away from making those words a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany thoughts ran through his head at the same time. First of all, these ladies were being very intimate out of seemingly nowhere. They'd only met five minutes ago. Was there some ulterior motive at play? Carl has been a sceptic all his life and this just rang all kinds of bells in his head. But moreover the thought came to mind that if it really went as far as they suggested, he didn't find himself too opposed to it. He wouldn't dream of doing it in front of all the other patrons and staff in the bar. But Katja and Suzie were very pretty, he couldn't deny that. A threesome with this pair of hotties was just about the last thing he'd expected when setting out into the woods tonight, but it wouldn't be unwelcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I interrupting something?\" Suzie asked, smirking at the man's empty stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he's thinking about us. At least he better well be.\" Katja added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty.\" Carl threw up his hands and smiled, making the pair laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say he's done his part, Suzie. Shall we do ours and take him home as promised?\" Katja offered with a sly grin. \"Orrrr, we could stay here a little longer and get to know eachother more.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the choices, one stood out in particular. Hel was a tall bear woman with fur as white as snow. She proclaimed herself to be a warrior spirit that would test those worthy of entering Valhalla. If they could stand against her without fear in their hearts, they stood a good chance. Those that could defeat her would enter legend. When Stephan jokingly asked why that was such a feat she gave him a short video of her picking up a car and folding it up like a piece of paper. It showed not just her immense strength, but also that she would stand a good seven feet taller than him. The thought of dating a woman the size of a literal polar bear intrigued him. Her fierce spirit all the more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir chats continued for a few more days before she suggested they met up somewhere. Stephan offered some ideas for a nice place to get a drink, but Hel had other plans. She told him of a gym on the outskirts of town set in an old warehouse. It was apparently used by monsters and a few humans brave enough to work out alongside monsters. He jokingly asked if their first date was just gonna be a fight. Hel said she wouldn't mind a round in the ring with him to see how much he could handle. Wouldn't want her love to put him in the hospital after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling up to the challenge he agreed to meet her at the aforementioned gym in a few days. In the interim he looked up some basics of wrestling. Stephan took care of himself and was quite fit, but he lacked the knowledge. Then again, what good was that gonna do against someone of her stature? Better than nothing. At least he could show her some moves before she'd throw him around the ring. By the sounds of it the main test would be if he was brave enough to step into a wrestling ring with her to begin with. A daunting task, he had to admit, but not one he would shy away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her instructions the man soon ended up in a large industrial lot, checking his phone as he walked by the warehouses. Finally he came across one that didn't seem to have any company logos on it that matched the description she gave him. He walked around the back and was greeted by Hel, who was waiting at the entrance. She wore some loose trunks and a baggy shirt, looking ready to hit the gym. He was still in his regular outfit, but he'd brought a sports bag with some more appropriate clothes in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stephan.\" She waved at him, recognizing him of the pictures he'd sent earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hel.\" He responded in kind, approaching the large ursine woman. He grabbed her large clawed mitt and they shook hands. She guided him inside, showing the gym and several strange monsters using workout equipment of all sizes. After some small-talk she gave him an opportunity to change. A few moments later he was ready and she pointed him to an oversized wrestling ring that managed to make even her look small. It was set up for ogres and half-giants, but smaller folk were welcome to it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surreal experience to climb into such a large ring for Stephan. It felt like he had shrunk. In the opposite corner stood the bear woman. Her toothy grin showed an eagerness to wrestle the man half her size that felt almost unsettling. But if he was gonna embark on this romantic adventure, he couldn't back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we get started?\" She said, giving him a sly wink.</span></div></div>",

Part of her hoped he'd be able to show a little bit of talent in the ring, but it looks like he'll have to be taught. A smile grew on her face. This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here I come!\" She announced grandly before barreling across the ring. She stood tall over her date, looming menacingly with her claws and teeth out. He surprised her by not only standing his ground against such an intimidating sight, but actually lunging towards her. He grabs her leg and begins to twist it. Hel's eyebrow is raised. Did he know she was just gonna play around or is he not taking this seriously at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan feels the impossible happen as the tree trunk leg starts to topple. He pushes as hard as possible until he looks up to see her letting herself drop onto the mat. It was a bit too crazy to be true that he could have that kind of impact on her. But she didn't just drop herself onto her back. Her other leg was quick to close in and soon he was locked between two thick ursine thighs. They gave him a little squeeze, making the man keenly aware they could crush his spine with a little effort. But as Hel was clearly holding back all he walked away with was the sensation of how soft her fur is. She parts her legs and gets down on her knees, putting them at a slightly more even level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, here comes the bear hug!\" She shouted, opening her arms wide. He grinned, fully expecting a terrible pun to follow up. He stood firm and tried to dodge her hug, but those big arms have a lot of reach. In an instant he finds his whole torso wrapped up in their muscular embrace. Hel lifts him off his feet with ease, pulling him into her chest and letting him stare at her toothy smirk as she gives him a gentle squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof.\" He grunts as even when she tried to go easy on him her strength was still overwhelming. It was unnerving how easily she could crush the air from his lungs, only to back down and let him struggle to catch a breath again. After a few squeezes he manages to slip free an arm. Hel raises a curious eyebrow, surprised he had the dexterity to free his arm. She was even more shocked when he didn't try to fight back but instead put his arm behind her head and pulled it down towards him. She didn't try to fight it, caught off guard by the brave little man. He didn't stop until her big ursine muzzle was close enough for him to plant a cute little kiss on her nose.</span></div></div>",

He was more than a little surprised by her reaction, but judging by her smile this was all part of the game. She let him slide from her arms, stumbling back onto the mat as the polar bear woman regained her footing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mighty blow for someone as scrawny as you.\" She complimented in a goofy tone. \"If you manage to sneak in more of those you might just win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan gave her a hearty laugh in response. With his victory condition set he would show this big brute just how dangerous he could be. He charged towards Hel and lunged at her leg, but she moved it out of the way, leaving the man grasping at thin air and falling flat on his face. He landed with a light thump and tried to get on his feet again as fast as possible. But when he rolled himself around onto his back his eyes widened at the spectacle looming overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel had come down on all fours, her chest hovering over his face. In an instant she brought herself down, careful not to slam her full mass into him all at once. He stood no chance, practically disappearing underneath her as she smothered him with her body. His little wriggles were an absolute delight, but it didn't take long for her to feel something even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was wedged between two breasts fighting to escape the restrictive sports bra Hel was wearing under her shirt. But even in this oppressive hold he would not let her win. It took considerable effort just to twist his head into place, but finally he'd turned it far enough to pop a kiss onto the side of her chest. Hopefully she noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" She yelled theatrically. The polar bear woman recoiled, letting herself tumble onto her back alongside the man. Stephan was nearly carried along in her acrobatics. He quickly got onto his feet to avoid getting smothered like that again. When he saw Hel taking an exaggerated amount of time to get on her feet he seized on the opportunity immediately. She shot him a knowing smile as he leaps up onto her, crawling up to her head and planting another kiss on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... you...\" She said with a haggard voice, pretending to be exhausting from this intense 'fight'. Stephan grinned, struggling to believe she was letting him win so easily. But before he could get too cocky her hands closed in, grabbing him by the waist and lifting him into the air. Hel made it terrifyingly clear just how much stronger she really was by throwing her date to the ropes. The large elastic bands caught him and reversed his momentum with ease, sending him rocketing towards the polar bear woman. She had taken the time to prepare herself for her next move. She squatted down a little and presented her large butt, waiting to feel the little man slam into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan collided with the soft mass with a loud smack. He tried to hold on to it, but his whole world tilted as Hel revealed her next move. She was simply going to sit down, using him as a cushion. Fears of being crushed shot through him, but there was nothing he could do. Hopefully she'd take it easy. In an instant he was buried up to his neck beneath her butt. The polar bear had leaned forward enough to spare him the majority of her bulk, but the pressure was still uncomfortably heavy. Her gym shorts did little to conceal the sheer volume of ass flattening him and he knew there would be only one way out of this. With a pang of reluctance he puckers his lips and plants a kiss on her left asscheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel shot up like she'd been stung by a bee, freeing her date from his third pin in as many minutes. But before Stephan could enjoy his victory he was met with her leg sweeping into his side. It knocked him back down and again he saw her looming over him. This time she crashed down with far less ceremony, seemingly more confident in her ability to play it safe around the fragile little man. The other thing that changed was her position. This time her chest landed somewhere near his feet whilst his face was pinned beneath her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you now!\" She said triumphantly, waiting for him to do what she was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan blushed brightly as he realized that her shorts were the only thing between his face and her pussy. The stretched cloth barely concealed the distinct shape and did nothing to hold back the smell. An overwhelming feminine musk radiated from her nethers. Paired with the strangely damp sensation of her shorts he concluded that either she'd worked up more of a sweat than he thought or his date was getting aroused by this. Granted, all the close encounters with her breasts and butt made it hard for him not to have a tentpole in his shorts too. There'd be no other way out of this. Not that he was looking terribly hard for an alternative anyway. He puckered his lips and planted a big kiss square in the center of her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large paw dug underneath and held the man pinned to the polar bear's body. Hel rolled herself onto her back, letting the little man 'pin' her. But she wanted more. Stephan tried to get up, but the hand shifted to the back of his head, joined by her other hand. She pressed his face down against her crotch, rubbing it a little as she pretended she was about to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not like this. Will the mighty Hel finally meet her match in the ring? I don't think so.\" She exclaimed loudly before bucking her hips and rolling onto her side. She let the little man flop onto the floor and rolled him onto his belly. A large hand pressed down on his back whilst she counted down. After all that Hel still had to assert her dominance in the wrestling ring, easily defeating her opponent. Stephan could only smirk goofily. He didn't expect this to end any other way from the moment he stepped up to face a polar bear woman three times his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this date is of to a great start.\" He mused, Hel nodding her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay miss champion... What's next?\" He gave her a curious look whilst the polar bear woman pondered her options.</span></div></div>",

It might just be the intimate encounters in the ring, but he couldn't wait to spend more time with her. In mere minutes he was back in his regular outfit. Hel didn't bother to change clothes, still smelling quite musty from the exercising she did before meeting up with Stephan. She wouldn't normally leave the gym like this, but the polar bear woman had plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Stephan, I want to get home a little faster than at human walking pace. So if you don't mind...\" He held out a large furred hand. Stephan cautiously grabbed it and was immediately pulled off his feet. She threw the man around her broad shoulders, the shirt and fuzzy padding below proving strangely comfortable. She then started jogging to her place. Though nowhere near her top speed Stephan had to concede this was considerably faster than he could ever hope to manage outside of maybe a short sprint. Though he expected her to turn towards a residential district soon it quickly dawned on him that none of those houses would be able to deal with her size. In hindsight it was probably a good idea he didn't invite her over to his place. As a follow-up he realized all these warehouses could potentially be secret monster housing. He wondered just how many of these buildings were even used as warehouses at all. Before long they arrived at Hel's home. It looked unremarkable on the outside, but the moment he was ushered in it was like night and day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of Hel's abode looked a lot like an old log cabin. The sturdy wooden walls were densely decorated with all kinds of small paintings and various random items. The warrior spirit theme was strongly present as there were multitudes of weapons among those items too. Axes, shields, swords, all of them far too big for him. Further along the wall some human-sized swords, some of which warped and dented. No doubt trophies from good battles to remember. Centered in the middle of this collection was a beautiful battle axe. Every square centimeter of it was covered in a fine pattern of runes and a sheen of red could be seen near the edges. There was no doubt in his mind this thing had seen a lot of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, impressed?\" She chuckled, watching him stare at the walls. She grabs the battle axe and poses with it. Seeing her wielding it so easily was awe-inspiring, though the fact that she was still in some baggy sports gear somewhat undercut the epicness of the scene. Hel put the weapon back on the wall. She motioned for Stephan to drop his sports bag in the corner.</span></div></div>",

She knew exactly how to repay that kind of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that's in need of a shower.\" She waves her hand in front of her face, frowning in disgust. Stephan doesn't show much of a reaction, afraid to offend his date. He silently agreed though, she'd worked up a sweat and stank like a pair of unwashed socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come.\" She motioned for him to follow, causing Stephan to raise a curious eyebrow.

Suddenly she burst into laughter. \"Hah! Don't tell me you're afraid... You've got enough stones to get into a wrestling ring with me, but a shower is too much?\" The polar bear woman kept giggling, tears welling up in her eyes. She motioned for Stephan to follow, undeterred by his hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he managed to scrape together enough words to form a retort. \"Isn't this a little... quick?\" His voice trembled a little. He realized just how utterly ignorant he was to how any of this would work with Hel. Thankfully it seemed like his bumbling was more amusing that offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, there's monsters out there that would've thrown you on their bed and ripped apart all your clothes by now. On the whole we don't waste that much time before getting to the good stuff. So calm yourself down a bit and get the lead out, I'm not gonna keep waiting for you.\" Her tone was beginning to turn a little impatient, but her words were strangely comforting to the man. It looked like he wouldn't come of as creepy for any of this. He burst into a little sprint to keep up with the polar bear woman as she entered the spacious bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was luxurious in size and carried the same rustic motif the rest of her house had. In the corner was a large showerhead mounted to the wall. Opposite the shower stood an enormous jacuzzi. A sink with cabinet and various other elements were all present, making the whole thing look remarkably similar to a normal bathroom. The only real difference was the scale of it all. It made him feel smaller than ever. Hel marches over to the shower and turns it on. Whilst it's getting up to temperature she takes off her clothes. Stephan did his best not to stare, but she made it a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick, white fur formed a beautiful flowing landscape, accenting her assets in all the right ways. Every part of her body carried a little bit of pudge, but she was far from fat. He knew that beneath that cuddly appearance lay a core of strength no man could ever hope to match. Having felt just a sliver of her potential he felt in awe just looking at those powerful arms and legs. Of course his gaze couldn't keep away from her hefty bosom. With her restrictive sports bra removed they were free to entice his eyes. Hel giggled a little, breaking his entranced stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? You gonna shower with your clothes on? I'm fairly sure you humans aren't <i>that</i> silly.\" She goaded, making Stephan blush. He quickly undressed, making Hel nod appreciatively. She liked what she was seeing, even if there wasn't a whole lot to see. Compared to the huge white-furred beauty before him Stephan felt almost painfully bland. She didn't share his sentiments as she gave him a sly wink and motioned for him to get closer. When the man was in arm's reach she grabbed his shoulder and pushed him alongside her, walking under the stream of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAaaaahh, that's the stuff.\" She cooed, relaxing under the warm shower. Stephan caught some of it too, but standing next to the gorgeous polar bear woman had him anything but relaxed. The last thing he wanted was to embarrass himself by having a boner right now. But she looked so amazing that it felt nearly impossible not to have any kind of reaction. Hel pays him little attention, washing the grungy sweat from her arms, chest and waist. She sways her hips a little during that last segment, bumping into Stephan. He blushes brightly, making Hel laugh. She reached down and grabbed him with both hands. The ease with which she could just pick him up like a doll was unsettling to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted insincerely. \"You really aren't feeling comfortable in this, are you? Well, I know just how to ease you up a little.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hel moves her date around in her hands, cradling him like a small child in just one strong arm. He is held close to her large chest, blushing a little as she pushes him against the soft surface. With her free hand she grabs the bottle of soap and deposits a generous amount of it on his chest. The cold soap sent a shiver down Stephan's spine, but Hel was quick to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, let mama bear take care of you.\" She cooed, smiling from ear to ear. Stephan pouted a little at being treated like this, but he couldn't deny that it felt great to have her large hands rubbing the soap into his body. She wasn't too thorough, but soon though it became clear she was just playing around. Her hand ventured along his legs, only to return and pause at his groin. He looked up at her, distress in his eyes. The pressure alone was enough to make his manhood react, throbbing a little against her furred hand. There was no way she didn't notice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? Are you getting turned on by me?\" She said, feigning surprise. Stephan shivered a little as she leaned her head close to his, giving him a small, toothy grin. When her muzzle nearly touched his nose she whispered to him. \"Because I sure am feeling something getting aroused there.\" She paused briefly to make him squirm. \"That makes two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan looked at her with surprise. It was hard to keep it in his pants at the sight of her powerful, naked form. But him? What was so special about him that got her all hot and bothered? She could apparently see the confusion in his eyes, because she kept close, whispering more into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the will to not only chat up a literal bear of a woman over the internet, but to accept a date with her too. And when she suggests you wrestle her, you step into the ring knowing she could tie you in a knot with one hand behind her back. You're tenacious, polite and above all, you really know how to please me. Those little kisses, even when you're flattened beneath me. Do you know how hard I had to resist the urge to take you there and then? But now, it's time I make you feel as good as you've made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan was shocked. Did those little things really mean that much to her? He didn't have more time to think about it as his mind was soon overloaded with pleasure. Hel slowly rolled his manhood under her large hand, massaging it with as much gentleness as her size and eagerness allowed. His breath caught as he let out a small, whimpering moan. The bear woman smiled, knowing she was on the right track. She could feel the pulsing cock in her hand harden. It grew fully erect and she was ready to take this a step further. The man was almost seeing stars when her felt her pursed lips plant a little kiss on the tip of his dick. But when he felt her warm breath washing over it he became less certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel opened her maw, her hot breath bathing the twitching little cock in warmth. She didn't pay any mind to the worried look on Stephan's face as her teeth came near his manhood. She closed her jaws around it, carefully sealing it in the moist cavern. Her tongue took a quick interest in the musky little pillar, slathering it in drool and making the man's whole body shiver with delight. The size and dexterity of the large muscle let it slither and coil around his shaft in ways he didn't think possible. Whenever the polar bear woman suckled just a little she could feel him ready to blow. Not wanting this to be over too soon she eased off on the relentless stimulation, keeping him on edge for a minute as she enjoyed his increasingly frantic mewling. There wasn't a comprehensible word coming out of him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she pressed his cock against the roof of her mouth, her tongue running up it's length to milk him dry. In mere moments Stephan moaned loudly and bucked his hips, his cock erupting. Strands of cum were launched all around the large maw, Hel eagerly swallowing his little offering. The man in her arms was breathing heavily, his body suddenly releasing all the tension built up within and going limp in her arms. She held him close to her chest, letting him recover for a minute whilst letting the shower clean up the aftermath of the best blowjob of his life. When it looked like Stephan had regained his bearings she gave him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it as good as it looked?\" She said, failing to hide her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hel yeah.\" He answered, giggling a little at his cheesy pun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hel wrapped the little man in a one-armed embrace, reaching out to shut off the shower with her free hand. Soon the soaking wet bear woman stepped out, holding on to her date and letting him enjoy her soft, warm body. Stephan sounded a little disappointed when she set him down and went over to the cabinet near the sink. She retrieved a hair dryer from it. It was built to match someone of her stature and the moment she turned it on she gave the little guy a goofy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brace yourself, Stephan.\" She mused, pointing the device at him and unleashing a hurricane wind. The force was tremendous. Stephan could barely stay on his feet as the hot air rushed past him. No part of his body escaped the intense gust as Hel dried him off in mere moments. Just as it looked like his footing might fail him she points the hair dryer to herself. With the sudden rush gone the human almost falls over the other way, no longer needing to compensate for the powerful winds. Now he was left standing there, completely naked, whilst she tended to herself, her wet fur taking considerably more effort to dry. He didn't mind though, it let him admire her size and beauty all the longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel smiled, seeing the little guy in corner of her eye staring dreamily at her. She was ready to make those little daydreams come true, but first she had to finish this job. It was hard to look seductive when dripping wet, doubly so when you have a thick fur coat. A few minutes passed and finally her overpowered hair dryer had completed its task. Every strand of fur on her body stood on end, a subtle crack of static electricity coursing through them. She knew just how to spoil the little man in front of her. Two large paws reached down and picked him up. She then wrapped the man in the softest, warmest and most comfortable plush hug of his life. Her smile doubled in size as she heard him stammer out a little moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe what he felt. It was like hugging a cloud. So unimaginably fuzzy and warm. He ran his hands through her long fur whilst she carried him back into the living room. She offered to make him something to eat, but the man didn't answer. Stephan was too busy picturing his date as the world's biggest plushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, suit yourself.\" Hel mumbled to herself, walking to the kitchen. She held him close to her chest with a single arm, taking a side of cooked ham out of the fridge. She tore through her little snack with gusto, her powerful jaws unconcerned with any bone that might be present. Not as good as freshly hunted boar or freshly mauled arrogant contenders for the afterlife, but a tasty meal all the same. She returned her attention to her date. By now he'd held on so long she wondered if it was just static cling. But as she set herself down on the couch she finally pulled the little man free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan was beside himself with joy. He'd had some trepidation about this date, but so far things had gone much better than expected. Hel seemed to have a lot of fun too. He cleared his throat before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T... Thank you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. But are you really going to tell me you dated a big 'ol bear like me just because you wanted a hug?\" She said, her smile turning a little creepy. She brought him closer until her muzzle was right next to his ear. She whispered as softly as she could, her melodic voice carrying an almost hypnotizing quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you really desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan went bright red. He didn't imagine even alluding to this for at least a few more dates, but she seemed so eager to play. He wouldn't let her down now. He swallowed his doubts and with a shaky voice he answered the question.</span></div></div>",

You just can't get enough of this big bear booty, can you?\" She said with a sly grin. Before the man could shamefully admit she was right the warrior spirit was already a step ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that can be arranged.\" She stood up and gave Stephan a good look at her beautifully round and fluffy rear. When he was on the verge of drooling on the couch she turned around and grabbed the couch pillows, laying them out like a small bed. \"Let's make sure you get a bit of extra... cushioning. Wouldn't want to hurt you now, would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan shook his head, shuffling over to lay down on the pillows and let Hel make his dreams come true. But the polar bear woman wasn't gonna make it that easy for him. She hovered her vast ass over him, teasing him relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh, you've got to earn it, human. Give them a good rub and maybe they'll be tempted to smother you.\" She said playfully. No sooner had she finished talking as she felt two hands against her rear. His gentle touch and smooth hands were a blessing, rubbing every inch of fuzzy asscheek they could reach. After a few minutes of bliss she returned the favor by fulfilling Stephan's wish. Gently she sat down on the man, carefully shifting her weight to not overwhelm him. She took great care, knowing the devastation her size could provide. More than a few contenders had been laid low simply by her crushing them beneath her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan felt in heaven. The warmth, the softness, the comforting weight. It was all there in spades. It felt even better that all the times he was daydreaming about her. Her large butt was wide enough to press down on his whole body. Barely a narrow slit of light was still visible between the furred cheeks and the pillows below him, just enough to keep him breathing and murring happily. He couldn't believe she was actually letting him do this. It seemed so weird and off to ask for something like this on the first date. She'd assured him that monster dates tend to be a little faster, but she'd already given him a blowjob and now this. Whatever he'd done to deserve this, it couldn't have been enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel smirked as she gently sat back. More and more weight was piled on the wiggling little man. Her plan with the pillows worked flawlessly and soon her full mass was bearing down on her date. \"Are you having fun down there?\" She asked with a cheeky giggle. Some muffled words came out from under her rear, but she couldn't make any out. He sounded happy though. \"Would you like me to grind my ass on you, little man?\" She offered. This time only a single word followed. Even muffled she could understand that being a resounding yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shuddered with joy as much as the overbearing mass permitted. The plush cheeks pressed and rolled over him in ways he struggled to describe. He was far too occupied enjoying every moment of them. He could feel his manhood harden again but he vowed not to cum. He wouldn't ruin the freshly washed pristine fur on Hel's ass, not in a million years. He felt her grinding more and more heavily until she finally stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear woman looked down at the result of her efforts and giggled. Stephan had been pressed firmly into the pillows, his face contorted in pure bliss as he barely even reacted to the weight lifting. To nobody's surprise he was rock hard again, but at this stage she felt like it was her turn to experience some pleasure. She grabbed him and sat him up on the couch, leaning down to speak softly in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's time this momma bear gets some love?\" She mused. He nodded enthusiastically, but then a concern sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where do I start?\" He said sheepishly. He had no idea what things might please a monster woman like her. Thankfully Hel was ready to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on your knees in front of me.\" She said, taking a seat on the couch. Stephan gulped. Hopefully he would be able to provide what she desired. It seemed only fair after she did all this for him. He nodded and got on his knees before her. She looked fearsome and confident, his head on the same level as her thighs right now. The polar bear woman parted her legs and instantly it became clear to the man what she wanted. Spread open in front of him was her drooling pussy. He clearly wasn't the only one getting aroused by that bit of buttplay. She scooted forward a little, the damp love tunnel getting closer to him. The overpowering feminine stench punched him in the face, singing his nostrils a little. The smooth surface of the thick lips was an inky black, glistening with arousal already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave me waiting.\" Hel said, half-moaning already at the mere thought of what he might do to please her.</span></div></div>",

She moaned as his lips made contact with her sensitive clit, planting a gentle kiss. His careful approach was endearing, but she'd have to encourage him to try some of the games she had in mind. Thankfully he was already working to provide some more in-depth stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan could tell his date was already happy with the attention she was getting, but he knew her tastes to be bigger than this. He would not let her down. He lowered his face, his nose poking between the soft folds and eliciting a small moan. He made her gasp when he stuck out his tongue, dragging it all the way along the length of her pussy. He could feel her whole body shudder with joy as he completed the short journey, quickly going down to repeat it. Several more licks had the polar bear woman breathing rapidly. She was sitting on the edge and it was time to push her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... hmmm... Stephan... deeper.\" She managed to stammer out between moans. He gave her a subtle nod. On the next lick he pressed his face into her pussy as best he could. His tongue delved new depths until he passed a hole. The entrance to her love tunnel. His mission was clear. He stopped and pushed his tongue in as deep as he could. Most of his face was now mashed into the slimy folds of Hel's pussy. Were she a little larger he might just be able to pop his whole head inside, but that seemed impossible for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHel would prove him wrong, putting both hands on the back of his head and pushing him into her snatch with all her might. The pressure made Stephan squirm but with a loud <i>schlop</i> he was shocked to find himself traveling deeper into his date. Only his head would fit but that was more than enough. He licked enthusiastically at all the parts of her sex that were within reach of him. Never before had she experienced such intense pleasure, especially not with a mere human. Where had this curious little guy been all her life? She watched as he put his hands on her inner thighs and began to pull himself free. She saw the opportunity for a game and her pussy took hold of his head as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan realized the inner walls were bearing down on him. This must feel amazing, it's no wonder Hel would seek to prolong it. But he was only human and he still needed air, of which there wasn't much inside her love tunnel. He knew she was probably just playing, but this wasn't a game she could win. He had her most intimate pleasure centers within licking distance. His tongue probed and explored. Once he'd found the spot that drew out the loudest moans he planted a firm kiss on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AaaAAAH\" Hel moaned loudly, an ursine rumble alongside her. She cried out with unabashed joy as she hit a powerful climax. With what few scraps of self-control she had left she put a hand on Stephan's shoulder and pushed, freeing him before he'd drown in her release. With a wet pop he came free, a river of slime following him. His head was utterly soaked in her love juices, but his smile couldn't be wider. That was the single most intense session of eating his date out that she had ever experienced. She dragged him onto the couch and with barely a spoken word they just sat there, coming down from their intense adventure. </span></div></div>",

She had exchanged pictures before but Simone still found herself flustered and surprised to see him in the flesh. Chester was a werebear, a freakish mix of human and ursine features. He stood just a little taller than the door frame, his broad chest and slightly pudgy belly covered in thick brown fur. His arms and legs still seemed mostly human, but his feet were thickly padded and clawed. Similarly his fingers were tipped with fearsome black claws. He didn't wear any clothing bar some tattered briefs, covering up his crotch. It gave her plenty of thickly-furred, muscular bear body to admire. One of those strong hands held a modest bouquet of flowers. With a nervous shuffle he handed them to his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" She says slowly, feeling somewhat relieved this wasn't all some elaborate joke. The bear man just chuckles. \"Hehe, I don't get that a lot from humans. It's mostly screaming and running for their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Running? From a handsome, kind fellow like you?\" Simone jokes, beckoning him to enter as she leads the way. Chester ducks down a little to fit through the door, his large frame only barely allowing him to squeeze through. He knew this was going to happen and with a kind, patient smile he followed her into the living room. The werebear carefully stepped on the carpet, trying to make sure his claws wouldn't inadvertently damage the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was candle-lit and she gestured towards the couch. Chester slowly sat himself down, not wanting to break her furniture with his weight. \"It's okay, if it can handle two of my fat aunts, you should be fine.\" She says with a giggle. He lets out a sigh of relief. Something tells the woman this has gone horribly wrong on a previous date for him. \"Just relax for a minute, I'll get the food and put these away.\" She points at the flowers as she wanders into the kitchen. A minute later she returns, holding a large serving tray with two plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester laughed as he saw the uneven portions on the plate. Simone had cooked a whole chicken, but only put a single leg on her plate, letting the werebear have the rest. She also replaced his cutlery with a chef's knife and a large table fork to accommodate his oversized paws. \"Figured you'd appreciate something a little bit more your size. Besides, wouldn't the regular silverware cause problems for you or is that only werewolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werebear let out a thundering laugh. \"Haha, those stories are a bit exaggerated. First it'd have to go into my bloodstream so you'd need to stab me with the silverware, and I don't think this is that kind of date.\" She laughs in response. \"Second, it's more like an allergic reaction. If I get to a hospital I'll be fine. but enough talk for now, this food looks absolutely delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes a little at his compliment and prepares to dig in. How are Chester's table manners? </span></div></div>",

Simone was a little curious what he was up to, but seeing his hungry gaze made it quite evident what was about to happen. Chester carefully lifted the plate and opened his maw wide. Rows of gleaming, pointy teeth lined around a dark gullet. It was a frightening sight for her, but she knew he'd never think about using them on her. The chicken on the other hand, was not so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester tore in to his food with the fevered zeal of a starving animal. His big maw effortlessly chomped through the cooked bird, undeterred by bones or other things Simone might opt out of. In 10 seconds flat he'd wolfed down everything on his plate, looking up to see the look of mild shock on his date's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh my... I'm sorry. It's just that it smelled so nice and... I just got... uhm... carried away.\" He smiles awkwardly, embarrassed by what he'd just done. Thankfully Simone was willing to defuse the situation with a polite laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I'll take it as a compliment to my cooking.\" She ate some of her own plate. She had nailed the recipe, no wonder Chester went feral on that chicken. She was half tempted to grab her leg of chicken and tear into it herself as a joke. \"Yeah...\" He just stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, it's okay.\" Simone said, putting down her plate. \"You're still my gentle soft cuddle-bear.\" She leans in closer, brushing up against his densely furred side. She had only talked to him through the app before, where he boasted about being like a big, living teddy bear. Now she was finally laid against the werebear's side and she had to conclude that he was grossly underselling just how soft he was. She expected it to be a little coarse and bristly, but it felt like he had taken a bath in conditioner before, his fur was soft and smooth as velvet.</span></div></div>",

He stretches a little, reaching his arm around her and preparing to give her what she's so clearly looking for. Simone just hums contently, wanting the nervous werebear to feel at ease. She's been on more than a few awkward first dates. Suddenly she feels herself shift as he lifts her on top of him. Her head is resting on top of his broad chest and his body makes for a very comfortable soft-furred pillow. He gently lays his arm around her to stop her from falling off and softly whispers in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it? I hope I'm not too forward, but you seemed to enjoy the fuzz a lot.\" He stammers nervously. \"I did tell you I'm like a big teddy bear, didn't I?\" Chester adds with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... If nothing else, you were underselling it.\" She responds, giggling at his awkwardness. \"Now relax. Give me a big fuzzy hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to be told twice and wraps his arms around the human laid against his chest. He took her into a firm embrace, letting her enjoy the endless landscape of soft-furred werebear. Chester closed his eyes and felt her warmth against his body. He could even softly feel her heartbeat. As he hugs her tighter it increased. She must really like the bear hugs. If so, he would not disappoint her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone feels his arm shift and grab the back of her head. He pressed it face first into the smooth fur of his chest. At the same time he also increases the intensity of his hug. His strength easily overpowered her and struggling was made nearly impossible in this firm embrace. Her arms were pinned to her sides and she couldn't open her mouth to call out to him. She heard Chester murr happily. Was he deliberately trying to hurt her or did he forget his strength again? As the hug got tighter she felt pain radiating through her chest. There seemed to be no end to the werebear's power, the pressure increasing by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester happily hummed and hugged his date. He feels her heartbeat rising quicker and quicker, imagining Simone utterly in love with his heavy cuddly embrace. After this he might work up the guts to ask her for a kiss. He was completely oblivious to the damage he was doing, hugging her ever more tightly. When he opened his eyes again he finally realized what had happened.</span></div></div>",

His feral nature had gotten the better of him again and he'd probably hurt his date. The moment he released his hug she pushed up and took a deep breath of air. The look of pain and fear in her eyes was one he wouldn't soon forget. He gasped in horror and pushed her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester didn't know what to do. He looked around in a panic, burning up with embarrassment. He could think of only one thing to do and ran for the door. \"Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!\" was the only thing coming out of his mouth as he attempted to get away from this ruined date as fast as possible. His heavy footsteps echoed through the house. By the time Simone had regained her bearings he was already near the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She cried out, hoping to catch up with the werebear before he left. His hug had done a real number on her, but it had stopped before any permanent damage could be done. Granted, it didn't feel that way when she was being squeezed that hard, but she didn't want him leaving thinking he'd injured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up! I'm okay!\" She yelled. The quick beat of his footsteps slowed before he could open the front door. Simone was still a bit shaky on her feet, but she walked after her date. Her step hastened when she heard him hesitantly open the door. She finally caught a glimpse of him when he was about to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chester, wait!\" She called one last time, but Chester responded with tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simone, I'm so sorry for hurting you...

Only once he opened his eyes did he see what he had done. His savage strength had crushed his date. Tears flowed from her eyes as she was barely clinging on to life. Chester's eyes shot wide open. How could this have happened? How did he not notice sooner? What had he done? He shifted nervously, drawing a pained gurgle from Simone. Was there anything left he could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I'm so sorry Simone... I never should have done this...\" He muttered, terrified and sad. He'd never dated a human before, how was he to know they were this fragile? His expression hardened as his thoughts turned to what he would do next. The woman in his arms was in pain. The damage done was too severe and Chester gulped as he realized there was only one thing left for him to do. He would make Simone's final moments as happy as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully the werebear cradled his date, guiding her lips towards his. They met in a passionate kiss. Chester tried to justify Simone's lack of movement by thinking he'd take charge. But it didn't stop the whole thing from being bittersweet. He'd killed the woman who loved him. Now he would make sure it would be painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone was barely able to discern what was happening anymore, her consciousness fading fast. She felt her date's kiss. It was strangely nice, but got lost amidst the rollercoaster of emotions she felt. All at once she felt angry at his clumsiness, betrayed by his monstrous nature and saddened that his brute strength had caused him to do this. Topping all these feelings was overwhelming numbness, the intense pain suppressed by her adrenaline. She was no medical professional, but she could tell no hospital would be able to save her. Chester held her close to his chest before giving her the last kind gesture he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werebear grunted, flexing his muscles and ending his date's suffering. It took no more than a second to snap her spine with a dull crunch. He let out a sigh of relief, happy that her agony was over. He felt embarrassed, guilty that he couldn't control himself. Now his human date was dead. This wasn't supposed to have happened. He'd pictured them living happily together. But if she was this frail, perhaps it was better that he didn't grow too attached just yet. He sat for minutes, feeling Simone's body go cold whilst his inner turmoil played out. At the end of it he set her beside him on the couch and with a weary sigh he prepared to leave. Hopefully future dates wouldn't end this badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over his shoulder to Simone one last time. Right at that moment his belly rumbled. The dinner she cooked was nice, but hardly enough to fill a big werebear like him up. And the way she was sitting there, she did look awfully appetizing. It'd be a shame to let her go to waste. \"It's what she would've wanted.\" He muttered to himself as he approached his love one last time, drool leaking from his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester left Simone's house with an awkward smile, patting his somewhat swollen belly. He slipped into the dark, pulling out his phone and loading up Monstr. Better luck next date...</span></div></div>",

A self-proclaimed pirate, he even put some of that corny pirate-speak in his texts to her. What was more interesting is his claims to have his own ship to sail the world and a desire for a strong woman by his side. Something exotic and dangerous, so why not a human? It made Simone feel a strange kind of special. It helped that he was quite easy on the eyes too. Handsome, tall, muscular. The thick, bristly fur and hyena-like muzzle were there too, of course. But the gnoll was a sexy beast in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her attention was drawn to the front door, loud knocking echoing through her house. They had agreed before the date that she'd be wearing something casual. Something that she didn't mind getting damaged or wet. Those instructions alone had her fantasizing about what this Seafang might do to her in the bedroom, or captain's quarters as he'd said. More knocks followed as it seemed her date was an impatient one. She opened the door to find several gnolls waiting for her. None of them looked like the dashing one she'd been getting pictures from though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, madam.\" The lead gnoll spoke with a growly voice. English did not come easy to the beast, but it tried to sound polite all the same. More distressing was the smell. She had few illusions about gnolls being clean, but the piercing stink of sweat radiated of them like a vile aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The captain has requested we escort you to our beautiful vessel. She be close by in the river. If you would please follow us. We'd hate for this to get... unpleasant.\" The others cackled with that last word. Each of them was a foot taller than Simone and twice as wide. They seemed almost disappointed when the woman simply nodded, grabbed her coat and closed the door behind herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, gents, lead away.\" She said cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would the lady care to be carried?\" The lead gnoll offered. With a cheeky grin Simone nodded and in a flash she was hoisted off her feet and thrown over the gnoll's shoulder. She gave a sigh, not sure why she expecting any different. Doubt set in as the sweaty smell was even worse up close. The other gnolls chuckled at eachother, some of them using the opportunity to try and sneak a look up her skirt. Thankfully the beast's broad shoulder was comfortable enough. She stayed calm as the pack made way for the river, making small talk with the gnolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long have you guys known Seafang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arr, he found us all as pups, raised us like his sons. Instilled within us a love of the sea, raiding and plundering. He inspires us all and each of us would follow him into hell if he ordered it.\" The lead gnoll said, sounding surprisingly emotional through his snarling voice. The others all quietly nodded along. \"This crew, she be one big happy family.\" The beast continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we all drift across the endless waters, our home ever with us.\" Another crewmember added, earning his own round of agreement. Their chat didn't last much longer as they had arrived at their destination. Simone was set down as gently as the lead gnoll could muster and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avast, me datey!\" A boisterous voice called out. His first line to her was a dad joke. Simone instantly knew the story of Seafang raising the other crew had to be true now. But as she saw him she was more than convinced a bad taste in humor wouldn't dampen this date one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeafang stood tall and proud, a toothy smile on his face and an outfit that had to be seen to be believed. A long, ornately detailed duster that looked straight out of a pirate novel. Gold trimmings, fine leatherworking and a scabbard to its side for a large broadsword, he had it all. His face looked as ruggedly handsome as ever. If there were any signs that he was older than the crew, his appearance didn't show them. He wore a stained white undershirt and his fingers were coated in large golden rings and jewels. His pants matched the duster coat and his large boots were shining as he struck a powerful pose. Simone was certainly impressed by the captain, but his ship was quite a sight too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gnoll pirate ship looked awe-inspiring and terrifying in equal measure. A rusted hulk, patches of crudely fitted metal covering holes from bow to stern. It looked like an old navy warship. The cannons were still there, but they had been loaded with what could only be described as giant grappling hooks. Gnolls were going about their business everywhere, scurrying across the deck. Most of the ship's doors had been removed and the holes crudely cut bigger. These beasts looked like they would struggle inside a regular vessel. It made Simone all the more curious to see what they had done to the inner workings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All aboard! The sea, she be waiting.\" The captain announced grandly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone followed the crewmen that carried her here up the gangplank and with a loud, rumbling blast of the horn they set off. Seafang came down to greet her more personally. To her surprise he didn't reek as badly as the others. There was still a very distinct smell of unwashed gnoll in the air, but she had worried that he had gotten his rank by being the smelliest gnoll of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard the Slavering Raider, miss Andrewson. I be Seafang, in case that wasn't clear yet. I look forward to this date. Be assured, the crew has been informed that you are not to be harmed or harassed in any way, lest they meet my wrath. Though if you warm up to these cute little puppies I am sure you'll find us all more than happy to share your love.\" He explained with a toothy smile. Simone breathed a sigh of relief, knowing how some of the crew were leering at her. But before she could get comfortable the captain leaned in, putting a hand on the wall behind her and breathing heavily in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you hurt any of my beloved family... There will be no safe haven in the world that can protect you.\" He growled threateningly before catching himself intimidating his date and stepping back. She gulped. But Simone didn't start texting this gnoll through Monstr because she was afraid. She steeled herself and turned her attention to the captain's first mate. He'd been standing idly, seemingly waiting for orders of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I don't think I'd ever be able to hurt a big, strong beast like you.\" She said seductively, reaching up to scratch him behind the ear. The first mate's tongue lolled out the side of his maw as he panted happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Breach, do you not have a place to be? Go and make sure the crew are ready for our next adventure.\" Seafang commanded sternly. Simone just gave him a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting jealous already, are you? I just want to show you I appreciate your crew too.\" She said, her voice drenched in sugar. \"But I'm not here because I appreciate them. I'm here because I <i>want</i> you.\" Simone put a finger on the gnoll's chest. His heart went aflutter as he felt his love for her be reinforced by her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shall see that Seafang leaves no-one wanting. Come, my treasure, the men have prepared a feast for us all.\" He extended an arm and she took it. Together they walked along the deck of his warship towards the bridge tower. She was curious to see where this would lead, but she hadn't expected to see anything like what the gnolls had done to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the steel hull had been almost completely gutted. Only a framework of thick, metal pillars was still left to keep the place from collapsing under its own weight. There looked to be just one lower deck left, a furred frenzy of crewmen moving around. At the front and the back of this cavernous metal hall were holes in the floor, gnolls jumping in an out. Probably the storage hold. Up above she could see the interior of the gutted comms tower, only a few crewmen staying on their posts to steer the ship and keep a weather eye out for opportunities. The back of the tower had still been left somewhat intact, forming the only real separate room within this large shell. It was even more remarkable because it had an actual door in it, not just a crudely torn hole. It was probably Seafang's personal quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time for dinner and the crew had set up a long table in the middle of the room, covering it with stained tablecloths and preparing an elaborate meal. The food turned Simone's stomach a little as it was very clear gnolls didn't bother with such fineries as cooking their food. Chunks of raw, bloodied meat were stacked on dirty dishes. Seafang could see his date's discomfort and spoke calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fret not, I had mister Breach prepare you something more to your tastes. You'll have to forgive his cooking skills, he tries his best.\" He surprised his date by hoisting her off her feet and hopping down, landing with a heavy thump and setting her down beside him again. \"Sorry about that, the Slavering Raider isn't the most... human-friendly vessel in these seas.\" He mused, prompting a chorus of suppressed giggles from the crew. The first mate emerged again, pointing the captain and his date to their seats and serving them both a roasted meal. Simone was pleasantly surprised. It looked a bit crude, but edible. What surprised her more was the captain being served a similar dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be sitting here and letting you feel all awkward being the only one to eat cooked food. Anyone got a problem with that, my boot is more than ready to listen to their complaints.\" He said brashly, putting a smile on her face. Of course there were limits to what the gnolls would do to accommodate her and cutlery was probably a bit too much to ask around here. Striving to fit in with the beasts she picked up the roast and dug in.</span></div></div>",

It tasted like it had been stewing in the first mate's armpit for an hour. It was nasty, but she knew there would likely be repercussions if she already started acting prissy around the gnolls. Seafang especially seemed to look intently at her, gauging her reaction. Was he trying to test her? After she ate a few more bites and put on her best fake smile he seemed satisfied. He opened his maw wide and tore through his dinner with great ferocity. She might've had a headstart, but he finished much faster than her. As she finally completed her meal she looked over to the captain. He gave her an almost silly grin and motioned for her to look behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone turned around to see the first mate standing next to her, an expecting look in his face. He wanted to know how he did. Should she be honest to him as part of the test? Hurting his feelings might not be smart. Splatters of blood were still present on his jaws from his own dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well, mister Breach. Maybe next time we can cook together...\" She said calmly, hearing a slightly perturbed huff behind her. \"...if the good captain permits it, of course.\" Simone added, looking back to Seafang who'd calmed down and sat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T... Thanks.\" He stammered, trying to stay calm in the eyes of the captain. \"I... I didn't have any spices to I had to improvise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's okay. Next time you raid a ship, I'll plunder the kitchen for spices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, she's already gettin into the pirate life. I knew you were the right choice for ol' Seafang.\" The captain yelled boisterously. \"Three cheers for miss Andrewson.\" He announced, the crew howling and yipping along. The cheers got even louder as he extended his hand and pulled her in the moment she grabbed it, planting a big, slobbery kiss on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone blushed brightly, held in the gnoll's strong arms, spittle dripping down her cheek. She could only think of one way to make this moment even better. She reached up to Seafang, who was hyping up the crew., and guided his face down to meet hers. With pursed lips she pushed forwards, planting a big smooch right on his stocky muzzle. The captain didn't need to hesitate before accepting this invitation. If she wanted the full experience he would show her that gnolls were monsters in so many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick tongue entered the scene and danced around in her mouth. Simone felt her legs turn to jelly as the powerful beast took charge, delivering a passionate kiss unlike anything she'd ever experienced. Though the taste was still nasty, she was alarmed by how little she seemed to care about it. All that mattered to her now was extending this kiss for as long as possible. The crew cheered even louder in the background, standing up to clap, dance and go wild. Finally it was brought to an end and the captain gave her a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been all my years?\" He asks, his voice barely audible over the crew's noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting for a strong, powerful man to sweep me off my feet and take me on an adventure.\" She responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And an adventure this shall be.\" The gnoll declares proudly. \"Mister Breach, give the command to weigh anchor immediately! The call of the sea shall be answered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first mate barely needed to say a word as the crew were all there to hear the captain's orders. A deep thrum boomed into life as the ship's engines fired up. Some stragglers stayed behind to stash the dinner plates whilst the captain gave his date an amorous look. \"Ya best be getting comfortable with the Slavering Raider, miss Andrewson.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Simone.\" She replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, miss Simone. Are ye ready for pirating, plunder and pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes and <i>yes</i>.\" Simone gave that last yes a seductive tone, putting a hand on the gnoll's cheek.\"</span></div></div>",

We got one on radar!\" One of the gnolls up in the comms tower called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full speed, let's reel 'em in!\" The captain ordered. Gnolls scurried back and forth, some now brandishing crude tools. Simone was surprised not to see any of the beasts carrying weapons. Only the captain seemed to be equipped with a sword. Was it just for show? He reached out to her, offering to take her back up to the main deck. She gladly took his hand, letting him wrap her up in his muscular arms. With one mighty leap they were out of the hold and on the main deck. Here too there was a flurry of activity, the main guns creaking and turning. In the distance she could see their target, a cargo ship. It didn't look like much, but it was getting closer fast. The Slavering Raider had some serious engine power and relatively little weight, making it alarmingly fast for something this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be knowing the drill, men! No witnesses, no survivors!\" The captain cried out to a chorus of yips, howls and cheers. Simone gulped a little. She'd expected the beasts to overpower the human crew and hold them hostage. But the captain's words, brutal as they were, held a measure of sense. She'd not heard of the gnoll pirates before and this was the only way to keep their secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less than a kilometer between the ships the cannons let loose a thunderous volley. Anchors sailed through the air, carrying iron chains with them. They crashed into the cargo ship's hull and deck, lodging themselves in the shattered steel. Several small crews of gnolls began turning a large mechanical contraption to reel in the chains and pull them closer together. When the iron ribbons were pulled taut another order was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Runners, introduce yourselves!\" Seafang bellowed. Simone looked in awe as some of the gnolls got up on the chains and ran along them towards the cargo ship. Maybe their monstrous nature made it easier, but the woman's jaw nearly hit the floor at seeing this feat of agility. They were met with the crack of gunfire as the ship's desperate crew tried to fight off these inhuman invaders. But either they were terrible shots or the gnolls were bulletproof, because it didn't seem to faze them in the slightest. When a bullet whizzed close to her and the captain he quickly pushed her behind himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Those beasts would dare shoot at you? If we weren't merciless sea dogs already I'd order the men to kill them all.\" He said, snarling a little at this affront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone was quietly happy to hide behind the captain's broad figure. For one it would spare her the sight of what the gnolls were about to do to those men. The screams and roars on the other hand were still clear as day. All the while the Slavering Raider was still reeling in the other ship. This went on until they met with a loud, dull <i>CLANG</i>. The shock nearly sent Simone to the deck, but Seafang was quick to catch her. The remaining gnolls jumped across to assist in slaughtering what was left of the crew. But cargo ships aren't known for large crews and the runners had already dealt with most of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the screams went silent Simone dared look from behind Seafang. It looked as harrowing as she thought, sprays of blood coating the cargo ship's deck. the men laid strewn about, most of them savagely mauled. Simone looked away, but the captain took hold of her and jumped across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone paid as little attention to the carnage as she could, following the handsome gnoll up through the narrow corridors of the cargo ship. It put his broad physique to the test as he had to squeeze through doorways made for humans. Finally he entered the bridge. There was one man inside, sat kneeling between two gnolls. Each had a paw on the man's shoulder, holding him down and giving him a painful squeeze whenever he tried to resist. They'd kept him alive for Seafang, but what did the gnoll have planned for him?</span></div></div>",

But as his home faded into myth and legend the amount of human visitors slowly decreased to nothing. Not that it made all that much difference. The only humans he ever came across ran away screaming. After all this time though, there was finally hope. An app that could get him in touch with someone who wouldn't run at the sight of his 12 foot tall half-man half-bull figure. Tim was a little hesitant at first, but to his surprise it didn't take long to find a match. Nervous as all hell, he waits at the entrance of his labyrinth to receive his first visitor in centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnaw the gnoll wrestler. Infamous in the village for his skills in the ring and his knack for using his unwashed body to dominate opponents, he's had a wide choice of gnoll ladies fawning over him. But secretly he was looking for something a bit harder to get. Being a 7 foot beast with a big paunch and muscles for days was standard for all gnolls, but he felt himself drawn to something wildly different. Something soft and tender. A waifish little human girl for the gnoll to cuddle and spoil all day long. What few humans were around didn't have a lot of status in his village. They were mostly servants and treated like dirt. But that wouldn't be the fate of the girl he met through Monstr. Gnaw would treat his new girlfriend like a princess, and woe betide anyone who would dare hurt her. Hopefully she wouldn't mind the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTinkle the pixie. Who'd have thought that being a magical faerie could get this dull. The same old 9 to 5 routine of mischief in the forest and doing menial nonsense like collecting teeth for some weirdo to make children believe in her. It didn't really matter to him anymore. He'd found the app and immediately Tinkle knew this was a way to get closer to those humans. Being with someone ten times taller than him sounded like the exact kind of thing that could help overthrow this monotony. Not to mention how turned on the pixie was whenever he got near them. He put on his shiniest enchantment to avoid any 'accidents' and flies down to his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim Clemson. A pudgy frog-man with a temper nearly as foul as his smell. He's lived peacefully in his swamp for many years. Every few months he might bump into a hiker, but most of them just end up pissing him off. And when Slim gets mad, his belly gets hungry. For all the headaches they cause, those hikers were at least a tasty treat squirming around in his gut. This changed when he met a young woman who didn't immediately scream in his face or try to fight him off when he crossed her path. She was surprisingly understanding of the strange frog-man and the two of them sat in the middle of the swamp chatting happily for hours. He even helped her get back to her car when it was starting to get dark. She told him about the Monstr app, where he might find other friendly humans. She even promised that if he made a profile she'd try to find it so they could learn more about eachother and maybe meet again. </span></div></div>",

Now the endless maze of halls echoed with heavy footsteps. Timothy, or Tim as he had started to call himself on Monstr, was on his way to the entrance. It would take a human lifetime to learn to navigate this place, but he'd been around for over 2000 years. One of the benefits of having a divinely spawned bull for a father, apparently. A pity it also cursed him with this monstrous body that got him locked in here. A powerful binding kept him from ever walking out the door, but nothing stopped him from inviting others. The tall bull man was expecting his visitor to arrive soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the entrance and straightened himself up one last time. Hopefully this girl was ready for him. It would be the first time in his very long life that he'd be face to face with a woman that didn't run away screaming. He wasn't sure such people even existed, but after a few weeks on Monstr he learned that they weren't just there, they were eager to meet him. A few minutes passed and suddenly there was a knock on the door. The minotaur was startled, but quickly composed himself. He put on his friendliest smile and opened up the large, wooden door. He looked down to see an awestruck woman staring up at him. She was just under half his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome.

Part of her wanted to cry out in shock, but she'd not spent days chatting back and forth with this guy just to lose her cool now. She eyed him up and down laboriously, almost salivating over what she say. 12 feet of muscle covered in a chocolate brown short fur. Alice liked her boyfriends on the taller side and this was more than she could have ever hoped for. She stammered out an awkward greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... Hey. Wow... You look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim flinched, feeling a wave of regret set in. It was probably too much to ask for some human girl to be able to feign interest in him. Maybe it was better if this didn't go any further. But before the minotaur could doubt himself further, she took a step forward and finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look incredible. The stories I've heard don't paint your image well.\" She gushed before composing herself a little. The woman felt somewhat nervous. Firstly because compared to him she felt very overdressed. She wore a dainty silk dress with some stylish flats whereas he didn't get further than a ragged loincloth. Though he'd told her that his options were limited when locked in a giant maze. Still, it left little to the imagination and allowed him to showcase every inch of his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... thank you. Please, come in.\" The bull-man replied with a smile, reaching out a large hand. Alice laid her arm in his palm and for a moment he froze. He gently grabbed her arm and simply held it, overcome with emotion. This was the first physical human contact he'd experienced in 2000 years. She played along for a while, giving the minotaur a strange look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... could I have my arm back?\" She asked jokingly. Tim realized how odd that must've been and quickly lets go. He tries his best to shrug off the revelation he'd just experienced and tries to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... It's just been so very long. Please, follow me. And stay close. Many humans have lost their lives in this maze.\" He motions down a hallway and begins walking. Alice follows closely behind, trying to hide the fact that she's staring at his ass. She had a hard time keeping her mind out of the gutter with such beauty in front of her. To break the ice she tries to joke with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that? Some scary minotaur killed them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! Because you could spend a hundred years wandering these passages and still not see every room. I rarely find what's left as anything more than a decayed skeleton.\" He sounded hurt and Alice struggled to grasp why. Wasn't this all just sort of part and parcel for monsters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't mean to assume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. It's hard to get to know what's really going on with me when most people would die trying to reach me. Every few years some foolhardy explorer comes in and they always get lost. I guess there's a silver lining though. The most recent casualty had a smartphone, so I was finally able to free myself from complete isolation. No idea how it still had any charge in the battery, but I guess it's for the same reason there's light in here when we're underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded, still trying to hide her oggling his body. She hadn't even given a moment's thought to how there was light in here. \"Yeah.. I guess. So I suppose that whole eating people thing is a load of bullshit too? No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, none taken. And yes, I've never eaten any person. Though since everyone who set foot in here so far has died, I can see why some might come to that conclusion. So how about you? What possessed you to try dating monsters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shuffled nervously, blushing a little. \"I've always loved being with someone bigger than me. Being the tiny spoon, having a big man tower over me and protect me. I know it probably sounds really lame, but... I like someone who can just wrap me up in a hug and make all my worries go away.\" Tim smiled and nodded, but he had a followup question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me then? I'm sure there's some proper mountain giants on Monstr. As far as big goes, I'm on the shorter end of the monsters out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... your picture on Monstr looked really cute and to be fair I'm afraid those really big guys would accidentally hurt me. You seem careful enough not to let that happen.\" She said, her whole face bright red. Alice wasn't a star in this romantic crap and she felt more embarrassed than ever. She was so busy overthinking every second that she hadn't noticed Tim was no longer moving. She nearly walked right up against his ass, stopping herself before things got weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've set up a little sleeping quarter down this hall, close to the entrance. It's not much, but it's as close to home as I can offer.\" The bull-man said nervously. Alice blinked and nodded. She realized she had already lost count on the number of halls they passed. Or have they not gone past a single one yet? The maze was playing tricks on her, she was sure of it. Thankfully the best solution to her problem was staying nice and close to her handsome date. They soon arrive at a small room. Small by Tim's standards at least. In the corner was an improvised bedroll and most of the room was decorated with scraps of cloth and old weapons and armor, no doubt leftovers from others that went in to explore this maze.</span></div></div>",

Is all this from less fortunate folks that came into your maze?\" Alice said, trying to sound interested in the bull-man for things other than his dreamy physique. She wasn't sure what to make of any of this, but her curiosity was thoroughly tingled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of it, yeah. Though most of these are actually offerings left by people. They'd just dump it in the entrance. The few notes that came with all that stuff told me it was apparently some sort of appeasement. Y'know, in case I ever got out and started to do monster things to them.\" Tim responded, chuckling at first before becoming a bit more downbeat. It felt painful to think about. These people gave him gifts because they were deathly afraid of his wrath. And though he'd have a few choice words for the cruel king that locked him in here, he had no intention of ever harming anyone. Alice could see the minotaur's somber expression and hastily changed the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that reminds me. You mentioned in your texts that there was something you wanted my help with? But you didn't want to say it over text. What is it? Why didn't you want to just tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt flustered at the sudden barrage of questions. Not the least because of the painful reason he didn't dare put his concerns in text. He felt his face redden and with the best awkward stammer he had the minotaur tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're the first person I've talked to for more than two sentences in... ever. I was hoping you'd be willing to... teach me some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What kind of things?\" Alice asked inquisitively. Her date swallowed his doubts and finally spat out what was on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C... Can you teach me to kiss someone? I know it sounds stupid but-\" The bull-man found himself interrupted by Alice as she raised her finger. The woman had to fight to subdue a chuckle at his situation, but it didn't seem that strange when she thought about it. This poor guy hasn't had contact with anyone for decades. How was he supposed to ever gain any experience kissing a girl if he's never met a living one before that didn't scream and run?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reckon I can, big guy. Firstly, I need to get a bit closer to that pretty face of yours. Can you get down?\" She beckoned, but the minotaur had different ideas. He remembered how much she liked to feel embraced by a stronger man. Carefully Tim wraps his hands around his date's waist and slowly he lifts her off her feet. She gasped with surprise, but the fear soon made way for a childlike smile of wonderment. She was so light and fragile in his powerful grasp. With all the care he could muster the bull-man brings Alice close to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you know how to impress...\" She mused to herself, fluttered by this display of strength. He picked her up like it was nothing, but now it was time for the next step. \"Right, back to the kiss. It's not really that complicated. You just kinda purse your lips a little and plant them on me. Try a tidy little kiss on the cheek first.\" She suggested, pointing at her right cheek. The minotaur briefly pictured himself taking her suggestion out of context and kissing her asscheek, but such silly thoughts were quickly banished. He did as his date instructed and planted an awkward kiss on her cheek. It felt weird to do, but strangely pleasant. For Alice it was surprisingly nice too. A bit forceful, but the minotaur managed to quickly correct himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a natural at this. Now let's step it up a bit. A French kiss is more of the same, but you kiss me on the mouth and let your tongue play with mine.\" The woman spoke with thinly disguised glee. She already imagined his thick, bovine tongue playing with her. Tim did not disappoint, following her instructions with gusto. He felt her take hold of his head to prolong the event, beaming with pride that his first time was worth extending. Alice's dreams came true as his large tongue danced around in her mouth. The taste was completely irrelevant as she struggled to keep up with the beast's sheer size. After several more passionate kisses the minotaur finally set his date back down on the ground. She felt flustered, possibly even aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had talked at length about how far they were willing to take this date. Both were ready to go all the way if the mood allowed it. And whether it was Tim's beautiful, strong body or oafish charm, she felt ready to take this much further. The woman shot him a seductive glare so over the top even he couldn't miss it. The minotaur approached, standing in all his towering, muscular might before his date. Where did she want to take this next?</span></div></div>",

Tim wasn't entirely sure what she was alluding to, but it clicked the instant she began to take off her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you don't waste any time with this. Is that normal for a human date?\" He asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted and turned, trying to get her fancy dress off. The damn thing had been a nightmare to get into. She just stammered an awkward laugh, failing to respond with anything more than an annoyed grunt. Tim was quick to the rescue, offering her a strong arm to lean on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon dammit, don't ruin this moment for me.\" She hissed under her breath when finally the zipper of her dress flew into motion. In one smooth move the silk came free and fell to the floor. Alice looked up to see Tim's eyes widen with amazement. Beneath her dress all she wore was a white lace negligee. It left almost nothing covered, the dainty straps and patches so thin they were practically imaginary. Seeing her date this cowed by her naked body felt great, but her curiosity was drawn further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been thinking about this long before they met up. Through their texts she'd floated the idea before, but Tim had no frame of reference to provide a good answer. If he stood twice as tall as a man, would that translate to his endowment too? And what extra length would being a mythical beast add? She was eager to find out as she took a step closer, standing face to face with the bull-man's shaggy loincloth. He seemed a little confused at what she was doing. Suddenly she put a hand near the top of his only garment and ran it down along the length of it. She giggled a little when she felt what it was concealing. It was clear that his divine background had not skimped on the important parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's my turn then...\" Tim said with as much confidence as he could muster. He felt out of his depth compared to the small woman taking charge. But if she wanted to see what was behind the curtains, he would gladly blow her mind. His baritone voice was enough to make Alice's legs feel unsteady already. Just wait until she got a look at his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood enraptured as he pushed the loose waistband down, letting the loincloth flop to his ankles and stepping out of the little heap of cloth. There wasn't a thread of clothing anymore on the minotaur and his package swung freely in front of his date. It felt wrong to expose himself not even an hour after inviting her into his home, but the look on her face told him she wasn't going to complain. Seeing it hang there made Alice feel even smaller than before. It was thick, dark brown bordering on black and topped with a flared tip. A heavy musk filled the air. She raised a hand, curious to touch it before realizing how weird it must look for her to be so fixated on his groin. She looked up into his big bovine eyes and stammered out her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's huge... Can I... touch it?\" The woman blushed brightly. Tim just shrugged, pleased to see she was impressed by what he was packing. She put her hand at the base, running her dainty fingers all along the shaft. It drew a subdued moo from the bull-man, causing her to look up and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry...\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" She said, patting his cock again. This time it throbbed with excitement, twitching a little and slowly starting to grow erect. Alice took off her skimpy underwear, standing every bit as naked as her date. She knew she wanted to show him the dizzying heights of an orgasm, but how does she go about pleasing this beast of a man?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice blushed a little as she imagined what was about to happen next. First though, she felt obliged to get Tim as aroused as she was. Without a hint of fear she grabbed hold of the shaft with both hands and began to rub it. The large minotaur's whole body shivered as he was overwhelmed by the sensation. He didn't quite understand why this felt so great. Being alone for millennia meant he helped himself from time to time, but her dainty little hands provoked things from him he'd never experienced before. The floppy mass grew quickly in her hands, the woman only encouraging it further. If she wasn't careful he'd blow his load before they even got started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmpf... Isn't this... a little quick... for a first date?\" The shy bull-man asked, grunting and huffing as he was awed by the vigor with which his date was polishing his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably?\" Alice replied. \"But this isn't exactly a normal date anyway, so who cares, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't fault her logic, even if he worried about embarrassing himself in front of her. After a few minutes she slowed her pace and looked at him proudly. The minotaur's cock stood rigid and erect, twitching a little with desire. Alice naughtily brought her hand down to her own groin and began to rub it. The small amounts of Tim's pre that leaked onto her fingers from before served to lubricate her action. After mere moments of this pleasure she looked Tim in his big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. Do it. Make love to me like only a big, strong beast of a man like you could.\" She said, half-moaning already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? I'm way too big for that. You'd get hurt. I don't want to hurt you.\" Tim said, staring with concern at the increasingly horny woman. Alice wasn't about to take no for an answer though. She'd fantasized for too long about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me. Let's just say I've got experience with large men. I'll be fine. Just go slowly and enjoy it. I'll let you know if it's too much.\" She said, her voice a mix of reassuring and thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur hesitated for a moment, but he trusted her. Carefully he picked her up again, holding her with both hands and bringing her up close with his cock. The tip twitched as it dragged along her belly and down towards its destination. Alice moaned as she felt the thick, flared tip press against her pussy. She could feel the bull-man's heartbeat with each subtle throb. Tim was still hesitant to continue, but the look in her eyes told him she was dying for him to get a move on. And something about feeling the wet warmth of her most intimate region pressed against his manhood was certainly arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooh...\" Alice moaned as she felt the pressure between her legs mount. He was really going to do it. That monster cock was going to penetrate her. She'd been reassuring before, but now that she could feel it actually enter her doubts began to spring up. Her worries were suppressed when the minotaur entered her, sending a powerful rush of pleasure through her. She felt like putty in his big, strong hands. His gentleness was greatly appreciated, as she savoured every new millimeter of his shaft burrowing into her. He took the greatest care to be slow and methodical, letting her feel in control even as his massive cock was slowly exploring her nethers. It filled her so completely it was impossible for him not to hit all the right spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was shocked to see her moaning lewdly even after sliding himself halfway into her. He'd expected some form of protest or simply a barrier as he'd reach the maximum depth, but this woman seemed damn near bottomless. More and more of his manhood was enveloped by her love tunnel, bathing it in an eerie warmth like he'd never felt before. Could this strange woman really take all he had to offer? Were all human women able to handle beasts like him that stood twice their size? It felt so good, he definitely wasn't going to stop her from trying.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alice moaned loudly as she felt her insides being probed by the massive manhood of Tim. He was everything she could dream of and more. And judging by his heavy breathing, he was thinking much the same about her. Though there was still concern in his eyes, she did the best she could to reassure him between the waves of pleasure overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim steadily pushed the woman down, letting more and more of his length be surrounded by her warmth. She'd already taken on far more then he ever thought possible for any human woman and there still was no end in sight. How much longer before the tip would start pushing up her neck and out her mouth? Finally he was met with the eerie sensation of her ass pressed against the base of his dick. She'd pulled off the impossible and taken it all. His throbbing shaft was buried completely inside of Alice and all he could think about is how good it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the limit still not found the bull-man gained some confidence, pulling himself back a little before plunging his mass in deep. He'd been carefully exploring at first, now it felt like he could fuck her in earnest. His grip on her body tightened and his smile widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice realized that her minotaur date was about to kick things up a gear and all she could think of doing was whisper \"Do it.\" up towards him. She felt the thick mass of his cock slide partway out only to drive itself back in to her. It was amazing. Both her pussy and his cock were soaking wet, a few dribbles leaking onto the floor with each thrust. It slickened the process, making it easy for Tim to up the tempo, steadily pumping in and out. His heavy, near feral breathing only aroused her further. They were so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more vigorous thrusts the dam finally burst. Tim let out what sounded like a mix of mooing and moaning and Alice joined in. A wave of heat entered her, his member spraying a huge load into her depths. She felt practically aglow with his seed whilst her pussy clenched around the meaty pillar, desperate to keep it inside for as long as possible. The minotaur kept on releasing more and more inside of her, the excess beginning to leak out. The small dribble turned to a flood the moment he pulled his wilting manhood out, making a mess on the floor. He pulled her close to his muscular chest, exchanging his awkward grip with a powerful hug. Alice quickly returned the favor, wrapping her arms around as much of his torso as she could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the first to speak after this intimate moment. With excitement in her voice she complimented her date. \"That was something else. I knew this night would be unforgettable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gave her a pleased grin in return. \"You can say that again. What even happened just now? I'm not sure that was supposed to be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Alice replied coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you able to handle all of me? You're less than half my size. Or are humans just ridiculously well-endowed for their body sizes?\" He sounded frustrated, unable to make sense of it. Alice pitied the poor monster and finally revealed her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, a normal human would've probably been badly hurt by that big package of yours. But I didn't want you to have to hold back. So I may or may not have met with a different monster earlier. And they might have given me a little 'help' in handling things far too large for ordinary humans.\" She didn't know how he was going to react. At first his embrace seemed to loosen, letting her crane her head far enough back to look into his big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that... for me?\" He asked, still a little incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Alice said with as much confidence as she could. It wasn't just for Tim, but she didn't want to spoil the moment. She almost wished she had as the bull-man showed his gratitude by tightening his hug, those strong arms now squeezing her so badly it became hard to breathe. She was pressed fiercely against those rock-hard muscles, feeling a whole new wave of arousal coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his date was daydreaming in his arms Tim sat down, still holding her against his chest. It seemed like this strange woman was an exception from normal humans, but he was just happy to have someone to share this moment with. After so many centuries without any kind of contact, he almost wished she'd never leave his side.</span></div></div>",

He looked down at Alice and she seemed to share his mood, her eyes already looking heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... want to stay for the night? I've not got much for you to sleep on, but~\" Tim was interrupted as she laid a finger on his lips. She patted his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got plenty for me to sleep with.\" She whispered seductively, making the minotaur smile. He held on to her tightly as he laid himself down, preparing for some pretty ridiculous level of spooning. It felt more like a teaspoon and a soup ladle, but neither of them were deterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" She mused, puckering her lips and expecting a good night kiss. Tim smiled and responded in kind, his baritone voice sending a delighted shiver down her spine, followed by his big lips pressing up against hers. They shared this passionate moment with closed eyes, their tongues dancing around one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minotaur laid down to sleep he raised an arm and snapped his fingers. The strange, ambient lighting around them dimmed, allowing the pair the darkness they needed to rest in. But it didn't take long for Alice to notice something odd. Her head was nestled against his pecs and she listened to the heartbeat inside. Where she expected a calm, steady thrum it was instead racing far faster than she would have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim? Are you okay?\" She said, keeping her voice low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah...\" He responded absent-mindedly. It's a good thing it was dark, or she would've seen him blush bright red. He didn't want to tell her, but he was daydreaming about all the intimacy he'd felt today. Almost inevitable this stirred up something in his loins too. The next hint he gave Alice was a whole lot less ambiguous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the warm tip of his cock bump into her leg and suddenly it clicked for her. She clambered up a little to get closer to his head. With a slightly smug tone she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still horny, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uhhh...\" Tim stammered, feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I.\" She added before lowering herself down along his body. Tim's embarrassment turned to lust as he wanted nothing more than to please this wonderful woman. And now he had her permission to do it he wouldn't keep her waiting. His strong hands took hold of her hips, navigating them towards the tip of his cock. The darkness only added to the intimacy as Alice held on to his strong body, ready to let him ravage her again. She moaned as the broad tip pressed against her pussy and cried out with pleasure as it took the plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt more confident, knowing the woman he was making love with had no limits as to the amount of cock she could hold. But he had no interest in just fucking her and being done with it. He would take things slow and steady, just to draw out the intense pleasure. His powerful thrusts drew a small moan from her every time, more and more of the thick shaft sinking into her bottomless pussy. He could feel her twitching and thrashing in his embrace, spasms of intimate joy wracking her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... YES...\" Alice moaned, feeling his girthy mass intruding in her body. She was fearless, knowing her preparation would protect her against his size. Whenever he slowed down too much she bucked her hips, practically forcing herself down on the veiny shaft. His deep voice made the grunts in the dark sound menacing, but his comforting hold on her made it had to feel anything other than aroused and safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the rush of hot spunk came and the bull-man held his lover down firmly. Not a drop would be spilled onto the bed. She moaned alongside him, feeling this fresh batch join the previous one deep inside her. Exhausted by another intense round of sex the two simply laid motionless, the minotaur's wilting cock still lodged inside of her. Even flaccid it felt enormous. Alice moaned softly, begging him to leave it there.</span></div></div>",

Tim's eyes felt heavy and Alice was practically begging him not to dislodge her from his shaft. Even flaccid it would take her considerable effort to free herself, likely beyond what she could manage. The slick, warm embrace of her pussy was pleasant. He gave a tired shrug, leaving her stuck on his manhood as she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rested herself against her date's belly, smiling as his large arms wrapped around her to provide further comfort. Everything seemed to be just right. The bull-man's soft body, his kind embrace. Even the gently throbbing mass embedded inside of her felt great. She closed her eyes, drifting to sleep and dreaming vividly about her encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the other, they shared the same lewd dreams. In it they were having sex like before, but the size difference was even more skewed. Tim's manhood was bigger than Alice's body, but this didn't deter them from going at it like their lives depended on it. Her body stretched around his cock like a novelty condom and all she did was cry out for more. Almost on command the bull-man grew, the scenario verging on the comical. Finally they reached a shared climax, crying and moaning with pleasure. All around them the world seemed to fade until the sheer, raw joy was all that was left in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice woke up first, discovering her dream was only partially a dream. In his sleep, the minotaur had not only gotten hard again. He'd blown another load inside of her, her belly feeling heavy with his seed. Though the labyrinth provided no visible way to tell how much time had passed, she knew it was morning. She rubbed her date's belly, hoping to gently wake him up too. She got more than she bargained for when Tim yawned loudly, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah.\" rang out from between his legs, the bull-man looking down to find he'd dragged his date along on his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry.\" He mumbled, wrapping his hands around her waist and finally freeing her from this lewd impalement. She moaned as the girthy shaft pressed against her most sensitive points upon exiting. But as this heavy cork was popped, a flood of gooey cum was released with it. It made Tim blush to see how much he'd pumped into her, but all Alice could do was laugh, easing his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well?\" He asked, still a little concerned he might've made her uncomfortable last night. Alice gave him a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. I dreamt about you.\" She winked shyly. Tim blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dreamt about you too...\" He added, omitting the part where he dreamt about them having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were so big...\" Alice said, staring up into his friendly eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were so... soft...\" Tim replied. With each passing second more of the dream faded from his memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were so... hard...\" She returned, giving him a suggestive grin and running her hand along his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim blushed, getting up onto his feet. Alice wasn't so quick to follow though, staying seated on his bed. The minotaur turned around and gave her a curious look. She gave him a mysterious smile before speaking up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slim was hiking down the narrow trail, eager to meet up again with his date. She'd been sending him all kinds of teasing messages, looking forward to their date. He wasn't wholly sure what she had in mind, but he was happy to just meet someone like her. The parking lot was relatively close by, though he didn't plan to go all the way there. They agreed to meet up a little bit off the trail so any other hikers that might be there wouldn't cause a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later he heard someone up ahead on the trail. Slim quickly hid behind a few trees, his pudgy frame making it difficult to be fully concealed. Carefully he peeked to see if this was just some random hiker or his date. He'd never felt this nervous around humans before. Normally he'd just barge down the path and they could get out of the way or else. Why was he suddenly acting like this? He couldn't ponder on his little anxieties any longer when he heard a distinct voice call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slim? You out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a boulder just slipped off the frog-man's shoulders. He emerged from behind the tree, waving his arm and greeting her. \"Hey there. Good to see you again.\" Jessica didn't even seem remotely shocked to see him skulking through the woods like that. He quickly closed the distance and extended a large hand. She felt a touch intimidated as the pudgy monster stood a solid three feet taller than her, but she wouldn't show it. His skin was a little damp and remarkably smooth, surprising giving his rough outdoorsy lifestyle in his swamp. She giggled as she could tell he really held back on his handshake, not wanting to hurt her. Slim cleared his throat and finally found the words he wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jessica, shall we go to my place? I mean, we can go somewhere else too if you've got plans, but I reckon most human places might give me some weird looks.\" He got increasingly flustered by the word, seemingly forgetting he was by now holding on to her hand for an awkwardly long amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica calmly put her other hand on his and in her most soothing voice responded. \"That would be lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... do you want me to... carry you?\" Slim asked nervously, finally letting go of her hand. Jessica blushed, thinking about the sensation of those big, strong arms lifting her off her feet. \"Only if I'm not too heavy for you. I don't want to be a burden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog-man smiles and leans down, one arm behind her back and another behind her thighs. In one seamless sweep he picks her up, cradling her like a child. He blushes brightly, giving her a reassuring look. \"You're even lighter than I imagined.\" He flexes his muscles a little, rocking his date back and forth to get her as comfortable as possible. Jessica was feeling more than a little flustered. Firstly by him picking her up with such ease and secondly by him seeming having no problems carrying her. She thought he'd give it a gallant try and set her back down after a few steps, but he really didn't mind carrying her in his arms for miles. It felt strangely romantic, the two exchanging many amorous looks on the way to Slim's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape quickly turned from the small woods near the parking space to the familiar swampland that housed the frog-man. His humble abode wasn't too much further. It was a ramshackle construction, but Slim had spent the last week repairing many of the holes in the roof and tidying up the worst of the trash. He hasn't had to give a damn about the state of the place for years, since nobody ever visited him. But now he wanted to really try and impress the woman in his arms. By his estimate he was doing a good job so far, given all the loving looks she gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way they talked about many things. Their shared love for nature, how cute dogs were and how aggravating most other hikers were. Though their methods for dealing with the worst of them did differ a little. Jessica proudly explained how she told off a few hikers that were littering. Slim responded by talking about how he followed a few litterbugs and ate them whole. His big belly grumbled a little at the memory, making his date feel nervous. He quickly reassured her though that he would never dare to eat someone as pretty as her. They arrived at his home shortly thereafter and the frog-man carefully carried his date inside, finally setting her down on his couch. Her perched his heavy rear down beside her, unsure of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

I don't think using it for kissing is gonna end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The woman responded, her curiosity burning intensely. \"Can you... show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it as pulling me into a big kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how big you're thinkin, but that'll put yer whole torso in me maw.\" Slim protested, but her big puppy eyes only got bigger on hearing those words. Were all humans this crazy? The frog-man shrugged. How bad could it really be? He asked her to get up as well and move away from any furniture. He didn't want her to get hurt by banging into something when he yanked her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her lip, eager to see what this experience would be like. She had a mental image of him able to pull her into his lips for a massive surprise smooch. She saw him eyeing her up, preparing to land the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here goes. Don't blink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to giggle at his silly remark, but in an instant he opened his maw wide and his sticky tongue shot across the room. It hit her in the chest with a heavy splat. Jessica didn't expect the remarkable amount of force the tongue carried. It felt like someone just shoved her. But before she could parse any of it she was flying through the air, her date coming closer at an alarming rate, his maw still wide open. She smacked into the squishy base of his maw and it slammed shut like a bear trap. His bite only pinched a little, Slim able to suppress his instincts to chomp down on his prey. Instead he pursed his lips a little around her waist and began to suckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....\" was the only thing in Jessica's mind. She thought the 'don't blink' was just him being cute, but that all really happened in the blink of an eye. Was this the last thing most of his meals saw? And now she was stuck up to her waist in his big maw. She wriggled and squirmed a little, the heavy lips parting to let some of her out. From inside his mouth she yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'm fine. You don't take half-measures when kissing a girl, do you?\" She laughed. Slim laughed too, her whole body shaking in his maw. He took hold of her legs to give her a more comfortable foothold and kept suckling. The large thin tongue snaked itself all over her chest and face, leaving a sticky trail of drool behind. He'd expected their first kiss to be a little more modest, but this was fine by him too. She seemed into it, judging by her attempts to grab his tongue and give it a smooch.</span></div></div>",

The frog-man's slimy tongue soaks her in drool and wraps around her to give her a strange squishy cuddle. She returns the favor by rubbing it, making Slim shudder with delight. Finally he leans forward and guides her feet back to the ground before opening his maw and letting her out. The woman was drenched from the waist up in thick slobber, globs of it leaking down and dripping onto the floor. But she didn't seem to mind one bit, breathing heavily from their intense kiss. She looks her date in the eye, composing herself a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog-man raised a curious brow. \"What're ya talking about? What'll do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she fell silent, looking away in shame. When Slim pressed her for answers the woman let out a deep sigh. She sat herself back down on the couch and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Slim, I haven't been 100% honest about why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Was this all some sort of damn prank?!\" The frog-man felt his anger building. He was getting ready to show her the inside of his maw again, only this time she'd get a tour of his belly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, absolutely not. I love you more than ever. But I've got an issue with one of my exes that I hope you could help me with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, first date and already talkin' about the ex-boyfriends...\" Slim grumbled. He had soured completely on this date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to. He's an obsessive stalker and he won't leave me alone! I've tried going to the police but they won't lift a finger until he actually commits a crime. I'm begging you, please help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim looked at the woman. The fear in her eyes was as real as it could be, any monster could tell. He rubbed his temples and let out a deep, croaky sigh. \"And I reckon you want me to 'talk' to him and hopefully scare him away? You do know I like to live in a swamp because I want to avoid these kinds of confrontations, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gulped. No point hiding any more details now. \"I don't think scaring him will work. He showed up at 2am at my last boyfriend's house and spent hours shouting about how he was gonna beat him up. I'm at my wit's end with this guy. I wouldn't be surprised if he followed my car out here and is somewhere trying to find me. So I was kinda hoping you would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim gave his date a knowing smile. \"...make sure he doesn't leave the swamp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman burned up with embarrassment. Did she really just ask someone to kill somebody? There was no doubt in her mind that he deserved it, but it still felt over the top. And what would Slim think of all this? She glanced over to him to see the frog-man milling over his options. She shuffled closer to him, brushing up to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to do this I understand. I know it's a lot to ask and I-\" She muttered but he nudged her to interrupt her, looking down at the nervous woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll do it. If all them disappearing hikers don't draw any search parties, I reckon your ex won't warrant any either. After all, the swamp's a dangerous place...\" He chuckled darkly. He expected Jessica to be unnerved by his more monstery side, but she just looked relieved. That ex of hers must be a real piece of work. The frog-man opened his arms and she didn't hesitate to accept his comforting hug. Her head was resting on his chest. Though most of it was covered in a shaggy top, she could feel the smooth skin brush against her. It was a little slippery and cold, but strangely relaxing too.</span></div></div>",

Was it too much to ask for one date without this jackass? She watched the frog-man stand up, cracking his neck and knuckles and stomping towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're in there, Jessica! Open up!\" Sounded from the other side of the door, further incensing the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim nearly pulled his front door from its hinges, putting on his most ornery scowl. Before him stood a man considerably shorter than himself, chest puffed up. His whole posture crumpled though as he stared at the frog-man. What didn't fade was his attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? She'll go out with literal animals over me?! Get out of my way, fatso, I'm here for Jessica.\" He shouted, trying to worm himself past the monster. He didn't stand a chance against the frog-man filling up the doorframe and with an angry croak he was pushed back onto the porch. Before he could open his mouth again, Slim interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you listen here, punk. You managed to get on my last nerve the moment I heard your voice, so I'll keep this short. The lady never wants to see your creepy stalking ass again. So you walk on out of here and leave her the hell alone or I'll make sure she won't have to worry about you anymore for the rest of her life.\" He thundered. Jessica sat on the couch, hoping that the monster's words might finally get through his thick skull, but she knew the odds were tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go, big guy?\" the ex shouted. \"You wanna threaten ME? I'll kick anyone's ass that gets between me and my Jessica!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw a punch at the frog-man, but Slim's large belly just jiggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're doing this...\" The frog said wearily before growing a cruel smile. He grabbed the ex by his shoulder and planted a heavy blow in his gut, returning the favor. The hammerblow had him on his knees, wincing in pain and clutching his bruised body. Slim let him get up, hoping that this dose of harsh reality finally brought home that this wouldn't be a fight, it'd be a beatdown. His hopes were shattered when the ex threw another punch, easily sidestepped by the monster and hitting nothing but air. Slim's patience had bottomed out. He'd given the ex enough chances to back down, but now it was time to show that asshole why they called him a monster.</span></div></div>",

As much as she hated that guy, she probably wouldn't like to see what was about to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off, asshole! Why does everyone always want to get between me and Jessica?!\" The ex shouted in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a complete creep who can't handle rejection.\" Slim replied, stepping towards his victim with his fist up in the air. He blocked the next flailing punch with ease and answered with a powerful haymaker. It only hit the ex on the arm, but it was strong enough to nearly throw him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by the frog-man's strength the only thing still running through the man's mind was that to beat this beast he would have to fight dirty. He launched a kick between Slim's legs, but the monster stepped back, dodging this low blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pathetic, even by your low standards.\" The monster joked before closing the distance and grabbing the ex' shoulder. He pulled the man in close before planting a heavy blow in his gut. This time he didn't permit the ex to go down though. Holding him up like a punching bag the frog-man kept on raining blows until the man coughed up blood. He let his opponent crumple onto the floor, scoffing at his pathetic efforts. \"If you know what's good for you, stay down and leave us be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Slim could turn away he felt the ex grab his leg. The monster sighed wearily and raised his other foot. He wore heavy boots and probably weighed three times as much as the man simply because of his monstrous size. Both factors meant that when the frog-man stomped down on the man's arm, it snapped like a twig. The pain made him scream with whatever air was left in his lungs, further irritating the beast. Slim growled with annoyance before stepping closer to the man and raising his other foot. The ex was given a good look at the underside of the looming boot before it was brought down hard on his chest. The heavy stomp forced the remaining air from the man's lungs as well as cracking a few ribs. A second stomp followed before Slim reached down and wrapped a strong hand around the man's neck.</span></div></div>",

At least I got to have sex with my dates, but I'd wish that they'd be honest about what they wanted, up front preferably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman chuckled. \"I guess I can relate to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rajah Stripes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRajah smiled. \"So, what do you want to do? Would you like dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking for an impromptu date?\" Crystal asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm offering if you want,\" said Rajah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal smiled. \"Since you don't have anyone else, at least I'd be able to spend some time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish to have sex with a tigerman, I'm sure I can accommodate you there,\" said Rajah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal grinned. \"Dinner and a movie first. We'll figure out later afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing special, but it is a good one.\" He poured it into a few glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you need some courage?\" Crystal asked, picking up a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enough to lubricate my throat,\" said Rajah. \"Are you sure you're up to this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've heard that felines have barbs,\" said Crystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lubricant helps deal with that.\" He pointed at the nightstand. \"Looks like they got some of the good kind too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's useful to know,\" said Crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you want to do this?\" Rajah asked. \"Do you want to be on top or bottom, or would you like for me to take you like a wild tiger would a tigress, or do you want to feel my tongue on your sex, or do you think that you could swallow my maleness?\"</span></div></div>",

That was Drako Flametongue. The dragon had lived over several centuries and was very lonely because of it. Only his fantasy novels made it easier to bear with and his favorite was when there was a dragon holding a princess hostage before fighting against the knight sent to rescue her, regardless of the result. However, this only made his heart ache more and he would repeat this cycle until he heard about the app. It didn't take much to convince the reptile and he immediately downloaded the app before building up his profile. However, because he was a dragon, it made things hard for him to meet people and he eventually wondered he did something wrong before getting a ping from a Cindy Smith. The two chatted for a while and once they known each other for over three months, decided to meet up in real life with Cindy's friend, Sam.<br>\r\nNow, Drako was internally freaking out as he waited for the two and was checking the time as it came closer to the scheduled meeting time. Numerous bad thoughts came into his head and Drako tried to calm himself down with his new fantasy novel, but he could barely pay any attention to it.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but are you Drako Flametongue?\" A mousy voice called up to Drako and he looked down.<br>\r\nStanding beside him, was a mousy woman smaller than the average person and was dressed up as a fellow bookworm. A green turtleneck and jeans, as her glasses glinted through her long, blue dyed, messy hair. While she didn't look much, for the dragon, she was princess material.<br>\r\n\"Cindy Smith?\" He replied back with a question and all tension was released when she smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n\"Hard not to spot you out here by yourself,\" Cindy joked before noticing his book in his claw.<br>\r\n\"Is that the newest edition of the Dragon Hunter series?!\"<br>\r\n\"When you have plenty of gold around, it's pretty easy to get stuff like this, though a pain to convert into useable currency. Anyway, just started and so far it's amazing like its precessors. Won't spoil anything and...\" Drako said, trying to get through his nervousness and excitement about his book before a voice interrupted him.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cid, aren't you going to introduce him to me?\"<br>\r\nBlushing over her excitement about her date's book, Cindy turned towards the newcomer and introduced them.<br>\r\n\"Drako, remember Sam, the person that wanted to join us because that special clause you added in,\" Cindy said, stepping aside as a {Reader's choice} stepped forward.</span></div></div>",

Wearing a leather jacket over a white tank top, which was stretched against tits that was far bigger than her head and revealed a lot of her toned middle. Because of her wide hips, her ripped jeans could go over half of it, though Drako considered the possibility that her ass was at least as big as her breasts. With a stern look on her face, she walked around the dragon, inspecting him and the dragon was feeling far more nervous than when he was waiting for Cindy. Once she was in front of him again, she stared at him for a full minute before she broke into a shit-eating grin.<br>\r\n\"I like him, Cin! When you told me you were gunning for someone abnormal, I was worried for a bit. But you never told me he was a dragon!\"<br>\r\nSighing greatly in relief, Drako was glad he was accepted by her and turned to face Cindy.<br>\r\n\"Um, you see... she's my... childhood friend...I know it's weird... but it's... the truth!\" The nerdy bookworm stammered out as the dragon found this cute and deemed her worthy of being a princess before yelping loudly as a loud smack to his bottom sounded out, the flesh jiggling a bit.<br>\r\n\"Just had to see something. Anyway, isn't that the caf\u00e9 you wanted to go to?\" Sam said, walking towards the caf\u00e9.<br>\r\nDrako wanted to retort, but because of the cleavage shown on both sides of her, he had a hard time knowing where to look at.<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry! But she's doesn't mean any harm!\" Cindy apologized before running to catch up with Sam.<br>\r\nThe dragon just sighed and smiled at this sight before joining them. The owner was startled by Drako's appearance, but was quick to provide them seats and take their orders as they grabbed some books to read, as the caf\u00e9 was also a bookstore.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I guess it's late for introductions. Samantha Thoeart, or Sam for short,\" Sam said, taking out a hand for a shake and Drako accepted it with a fore claw.<br>\r\nThough she had no interest in literature, she was fan of the dramas and the ones of fantasy, her first being 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' by Shakespeare. Cindy showed videos of her acting and Drako was quite impressed, despite Sam stating she wouldn't survive a movie set. As they read and talk through their meal, they were able learn more each other than chatting online before the caf\u00e9 was ready to close for the night.<br>\r\n\"It's already that time? I had some fun with you,\" Drako said, happy that he was able to meet with the girls.<br>\r\n\"Glad to know that the guy I was meeting wasn't a total douche,\" Cindy said, smiling as she swore.<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we go to your place if you want to continue chatting,\" Sam suggested, Cindy panicking once more.<br>\r\n\"Sam!\" \"Why not? Night's young, and don't tell you're not curious about him! Besides, do you think he can get inside any of our houses without wrecking shit?\"<br>\r\nThe thought of Drako smashing buildings while people were screaming madly was enough to put a damper on everyone's mood.<br>\r\n\"We don't have to-\" \"Let's go! If, it's not a bother to you,\" Cindy shouted, interrupting Drako, but quickly made herself polite.<br>\r\nDrako thought things over for a bit before lowering his head and with a quick glance with each other, both women got onto his neck.<br>\r\n\"You secure back there? I rather not have to dive for anyone that falls off of me,\" Drako said, worry coming out of his words as Sam held tight onto his horns and Cindy onto Sam.<br>\r\n\"We're good!\" \"Relax, I rode a bunch motorbikes before! From the quietest ones to the meanest one, I'm certain I won't fall off!\" The women answered and Drako lifted his head, his leathery wings spread out for flight.<br>\r\n\"I'll tone it down and we'll see from there.\"<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, they've arrived at Drako's home, which is a modified cave outfitted for modern day use. As Drako lowered his head to let the women off, they scrambled off of him and began to hug the ground, Sam kissing it several times in relief.<br>\r\n\"Ride a dragon, they said. It'll be fun, they say!\" Cindy said sarcastically, trying to fix her messy appearance from the ride.<br>\r\n\"I'll apologize as many times as you want! Fuck, and this fucker was slowing down for us! Fuck! Don't to be on when he's full speed!\" Sam shouted, panting wildly.<br>\r\n\"I'm considered to be slow and it took me a minute to get there,\" Drako commented, both women's eyes widening and their faces paling at his words.<br>\r\nIt would take a while before they could move again and Drako used this time to read his book, which was in his claw the whole time. Once they were ready, he let them in and they gasped in awe at the amount of gold he had.<br>\r\n\"Fuck! You're loaded!\"<br>\r\n\"I had a suspicion but you never did mentioned you had plenty of money,\" Cindy said, hoping she wasn't too intrusive with her inquiries.<br>\r\n\"First off, you never asked; secondly, it's a pain to convert into usable money; and finally, I actually want someone who likes me for... well, me,\" the dragon answered honestly and Sam nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\n\"I get it, even though I'm not rich. Having these had always attracted the sleazeballs,\" Sam added in, groping her own breasts and Drako looked away with a blush across his face.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I've been wondering about how freaky you guys are, seeing how the night will end up. I don't mind who or what they're into (for the most part), as long as it fun in the sack, I'm game!\" Sam said, confusing the two until it clicked and the bookish couple blushed madly.<br>\r\n\"Sex doesn't come into the first date!\" Cindy shouted, Drako shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"At least tell me what turns you on!\" Sam begged and the duo share a look for a few minutes before turning back to Sam.<br>\r\n\"I, I guess we can tell her.\" \"Sam's trustworthy and wouldn't talk to anyone else.\"<br>\r\nThe dragon sighed and faced the boisterous woman.<br>\r\n\"Sam, you see, the fetish we would like to play is...\"</span></div></div>",

It doesn't help that her day job for centuries has been to tempt mankind into acts of selfish gluttony. But nowadays food is so readily available for them that her help is hardly needed. With all this free time she's started dating. At first with monsters, but thanks to this new app, the elephant woman was about to go on a date with a human for a change. Hopefully he could deal with her hunger before he finds himself on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie the naga. She's been enamored with those cute little humans for years, but her 20 foot long serpentine body has so far only yielded screams and panicked fleeing. She even chased down one to try to tell him she didn't want to hurt him. Unfortunately in her clumsy ways she tightened her coils around him a bit too tightly and he ended up dead. Now there was an app that would let the naga find willing boyfriends, which she was quick to get in on. Sadly this was going to be her third date as the previous two men she met through the app also got killed by her overly enthusiastic serpentine hugs. This time though, she was going to get it right... hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika and Katie the ogres. A towering pot-bellied behemoth compared to the men she was looking to date, but that wasn't going to stop her. Few knew of her secret crush on the little humans. They were a delicacy among ogres, but she couldn't fathom how anyone could think of them as food. Though her kind doesn't have much in the way of intelligence, she was a downright genius compared to her twin sister Katie. In spite of that, her sister was one of the few to not just know of Erika's admiration for humans, she was into them as well. Through the app they hoped to get lucky. What human would say no to a threesome with two ogre hotties like Erika and her sister? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nItsee the swamp sprite. She lived in a damp bog for her entire life, tending to the wildlife. She was only a foot tall and smelled every bit as horrid as the foulest pits of the swamp. Worse yet was that sprites like herself didn't live in villages like those fancy-pants faeries. She was out here on her own and the loneliness was really getting to her. There wasn't another swamp sprite around for miles and the local fauna seemed a bit too eager to try and eat her if Itsee got too close. The odd human that visited tended to be repulsed by her smell or just dismissed her as a puff of swamp gas playing tricks on their eyes. The sprite was over the moon when the dating app finally found the one for her. After so many years alone, she hoped her date was ready to deal with all that pent up desire as much as she was.</span></div></div>",

You must be Francis.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook off his initial fears and placed his hand in her large grey palm. She gently shook it, well aware of how fragile he was compared to her. Francis was taken by surprise by the towering elephant woman's subtlety. He stood back, looking dreamily at all her beautiful features. She had curves for days, her plump frame and round belly giving him lots to stare at. Slowly his gaze drifted up to her hefty rack. Her low-cut dress gave him quite the view and the elephant woman leaned in a bit to allow him a closer look. She didn't mind humans staring anymore. She'd been tempting them for aeons, their gobsmacked faces when they saw her were par for the course. Instead her attention turned to the car he drove in with. It was an old beaten up pick-up truck.

Francis shook himself out of his breast-induced trance and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, don't worry, dude. That trailer ain't for you. Well, it is, but not like that. Here, lemme show ya.\" He beamed with pride as he walked to the trailer and undid the bindings on the blue tarp. He pulled it back to reveal at least a dozen large trash bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me that you'll eat just about any food, so I went dumpster diving behind some restaurants. Hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina's eyes widened and she wrung her hands, approaching this newly presented buffet. Her long trunk hovered over the bags, taking in the smell. Some of it had gone off, others still smelled fresh. All kinds of cuisine could be sensed. Some pasta dishes, something Asian, even a bag full of stale burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Francis. You didn't have to do that, I already ate lots before our date.\" She beamed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry I guess? Didn't want to risk you being here all hungry and me showing up without a bite to eat.\" He blushed. \"Well, if you're already full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Important lesson about spirits of gluttony, Francis: While we might not always be hungry, we are <i>never</i> full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, that's deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I give this scrumptious gesture the attention it deserves. Afterwards I'll give you a fitting reward.\" The elephant woman sat down beside the trailer and licked her chops. Francis took a few steps back, not wanting to get between Rheina and her food. She grabbed a bag, leaned back and emptied it into the yawning chasm of her mouth. The spirit of gluttony happily munched away at the food, working her way through his offerings in less than ten minutes. Her date just stood and stared in awe at the speed with which she made all the food on his trailer disappear. Finally she wiped her lips clean and turned her attention back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... about that reward.\" She mused, making him blush brightly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rheina carefully leaned down and grabbed the man with both hands. She held him gently as she hoisted him off the ground. A shiver of fear ran down Francis' spine as he was in awe with the spirit's strength. She picked him up like it was nothing. It's a good thing she'd just eaten, because there'd be bitterly little he could do if she wanted him for dessert. Though by her own admission she would always have some space in that humongous gut for him. It certainly didn't help that he was slowly brought to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, a little smooch. Give me all you got, little human.\" The elephant woman teased, pursing her lips. Francis looked uncertain at first before an eager smile crawled onto his face. He reached out to hold his date and brought his lips to meet hers. The difference in scale was ridiculous, but that wouldn't deter him. Her breath smelled like the stale food he'd just given her, somewhat uncomfortable for the stoner. At the same time, the distinct smell of weed on him made Rheina's trunk twitch a little. It wasn't a dealbreaker for either of them and soon they met in a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the elephant was in charge of events would be a hilarious understatement. Francis' whole head was little more than a plaything between her thick, soft lips. She smothered his face, smacking loudly as she left a huge, drooly mark on him. But his generous act had earned him more than just a little smooch. Well, little by Rheina's standards. He quickly found himself going back down, still close to the spirit of gluttony's towering body. It wasn't until he felt his feet get pinched together that the penny dropped and he realized her plan. He couldn't help but smile broadly. This was even better then what he'd imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant woman was blessed with an impressively sized rack. Each breast was easily the size of a smart car and Francis found himself slowly getting slotted in between them. The supple skin was smooth, clinging to his legs as they sank into her cleavage. The walls of flesh were warm and amazingly soft. The stoner moaned a little as his groin entered their embrace, putting a naughty smile on Rheina. She had yet to meet a human that was left unsatisfied by her rewards. She let go of his body, her boobs easily able to hold Francis in place. She pushed him down further, wedging him even more firmly until only his arms and head were still visible poking out of her cleavage. Though his mobility was limited, he slowly stroked and massaged the large grey mass of boobflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her date on cloud nine Rheina stood tall and looked around. They were still just in the parking lot and already she was having a fantastic time. She was worried about meeting people through Monstr and them not being able to cater to her larger than life tastes. But Francis had done a wonderful job proving her wrong. The night was still young though. What does she have in mind next?</span></div></div>",

She knew the answer already, but hearing him stammer it out all love-drunk was too funny to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Francis said, half-moaning at the sensory overload. Almost his entire body was held and massaged by the spirit's huge mammaries. His arms were still free to let him show his appreciation and rub them, but Rheina was soon looking to take this one step further. She guided him towards one of the now swollen nipples. The stoner quickly caught on and rubbed the sensitive flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little hands feel so nice. But my breasts can do something I bet you've never even thought possible.\" She teases. Her date shoots her a puzzled look. \"Oh? Awesome. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to go inside?\" The elephant woman asked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside... You mean inside your boob?\" Francis responded, sounding both baffled and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me show you...\" Rheina took charge and guided one of his hands towards her nipple again. But instead of just caressing it she pushed it down square in the middle. Some milk leaked out at first, but soon after Francis could feel the soft flesh yield and open. His hand sank into the nipple. He wasn't sure whether he should panic or not, but his date moaned loudly. Whatever this was, it felt great for her. There was just one little doubt left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a one way trip, is it?\" He asked awkwardly, prompting Rheina to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no it isn't, silly. I can take you out whenever you want, and you can stay safely for days, nourished by my milk.\" The elephant woman patted him on the head to comfort him. But with his fears allayed, the stoner began to participate a lot more actively. He pushed his arm deeper into the warm embrace of her breast. His free arm was used to rub the surrounding boobflesh, soothing it and encouraging it to prepare for what would come next. Rheina took a few deep breaths as she felt her date's arm reach in up to his shoulder. With a few gentle pushes she coerced the soft mass to open up wider. Francis' whole head went in all at once, provoking another lewd moan from his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes of aroused wrangling, but finally the last of his legs were sucked up into the large elephantine breast. Even with an entire human inside of it, the spirit of gluttony's rack looked balanced. She could feel his every movement and asked him to settle in. \"Just relax. If you want out, give me a call. But I wouldn't mind keeping you there for a little while.\" She mused. The elephant woman looked around and began to wander off. She had a destination in mind for this little cutie and now she could take him there with ease. Every so often she would rub the breast he was in, gently massaging him with the damp internals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis was sat in a shallow pool of milk. The walls around him all leaked and dripped with the stuff but the pool's level never seemed to rise. Of all the places he thought this date would go, inside Rheina's breasts was about the last he'd imagined. The soft embrace all around him was far from unpleasant though. He stroked the squishy walls, and occasionally they came down on him and smothered him in a snug full-body embrace whenever she rubbed her breasts. It felt wonderful, though he wondered what she was up to. He could feel his chamber shift and jiggle a little. The elephant woman was on the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Rheina take him?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The large elephant woman kept a steady pace, frequently playing with her date along the way. She shook, squeezed and petted her breasts, causing Francis to shuffle around inside. He felt amazing in there and she couldn't wait to show him more tricks her body could do. But before that she wanted to take him somewhere nice. Rheina couldn't imagine many human places responding well to a guest of her caliber, so instead she hoped the other way around would work. There's plenty of humans in the circle of Gluttony where she lived. Some sent there as eternal punishment, forced to gorge on food until they could no longer do anything other than eat. Others were sent here to be food, hunted forever by the denizens of this realm and doomed to resurrect after each fatal hunt. Bringing a guest like she did with Francis wasn't unheard of, but she still had to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis enjoyed is trip a lot, even given his unusual method of transportation. He'd love to say he'd seen this during a trip once, but no amount of weed could've conjured up the concept of going into a huge elephant woman's breast. Least of all the part where she's still playing with him in here and the environment he's in feels downright pleasant. He gave the creamy milk a taste when he got thirsty, making both admire his date more and wonder just how long he'd been in there by now. It was hard to keep track of time in the slim confines of Rheina's breast, but soon he would get answers as she began to squeeze him hard, coercing him back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are again. Did you have as much fun as I did?\" The elephant woman holds her date close, smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wicked, dude. But uhm...\" Francis' sentence fell short as he looked around. It felt like he had shrunk down. He saw a living room not unlike you'd expect in any normal house. But every piece of furniture was scaled to fit Rheina. He quickly put one and one together. \"... is this your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hope you don't mind. It's just that I fear I'll struggle to fit in your place.\" She says with a laugh. Francis can't help but chuckle at the idea of Rheina trying to squeeze herself through his front door. Probably for the best they went to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll probably need a hand to get to most places, but I gotta ask... Am I in hell?\" The stoner looked deeply lost in thought as he began to ponder his own question. Rheina just patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweety, don't worry about it. Technically, yes, you could call this a circle of hell. But you're a guest, so don't worry about your afterlife. The only people that make a big deal about cavorting with demons, angels and others spirits like me are other humans anyway, so you've got nothing to fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah...\" Francis replied, the realization sinking in that he was really in hell. It all looked so... pedestrian. He expected fire and brimstone, but there was little evidence to show that this wasn't just some neighborhood for giant folks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, I  think it's best we lay down some ground rules. First and most important: Don't leave my side. Just about everyone here is driven by hunger of some kind and I don't want you to end up in a belly that isn't mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" The stoner shook his head, not sure if he heard his date say that right. Was she planning to eat him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I wouldn't digest you if you ended up in my belly. And let's be honest with ourselves here, you're dating a spirit of gluttony and I could see that curious twinkle in your eyes from the moment we met up. But I'll let you work up to that on your own. In the meantime, is there anything you'd like to do?\"</span></div></div>",

Whatever suggestion he might give her she could probably fulfill. And that didn't begin to cover all the things he hadn't even conceived of. It was so much to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the risk of regretting this later... I'll let you choose where to take this next, dude. Surprise me.\" The stoner said a little nervously. Rheina's smile grew larger as she leaned in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Francis, you're such a gentleman. Very well, just take a seat and let me rock your world.\" She spoke, still holding him pressed against her jiggly belly. The spirit walked him over to her couch and dropped him off. She then pushed the salon table away to give herself a lot of space right in front of her date. With a snap of her fingers the curtains flew close and the lights dimmed. He had to suppress a chuckle as he saw the dark magics of hell being used to close curtains and set lighting. But soon his attention was drawn back to his date as she reached up behind her back and began to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a subtle click Rheina's dress came flee, the smooth fabric gliding along her skin. Her date's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull as she revealed her ample body. 30 feet worth of rounded curves now stood completely naked before him. He already knew she wasn't wearing a bra, but apparently she wasn't wearing anything else underneath her dress either. Francis blushes a little as he thinks back to when they met a few hours ago. She'd nearly given him an accidental upskirt back then, and now it turns out that would've given him a direct peek at her most intimate region. As though she read his mind the elephant woman giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here we don't really have need for subtlety anymore, sweetie. Now mama Rheina wants you to play with her...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Francis nodded at his date's proposition and with a smooth twirl she swung herself around. Swaying before him was an ass the size of two smart cars, jiggling endlessly. The soft surface was devoid of any mark or blemish. How something so beautiful could end up in hell was a mystery to the stoner. Though with that kind of size, merely sitting on someone sounded like a fine form of eternal torment for the damned. No sooner has he thought this when Rheina bends her knees and thrusts her enormous bottom towards him. She leans back slowly, smothering her date into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he feared this would be the end. Pulverized beneath his date's mighty rear. But as the seconds ticked by he realized he was fine. Movement was near impossible, but his body felt intact. Wanting to keep himself that way, the stoner immediately sets about providing his date the pleasure she sought. He stretched his arms wide and rubbed as much of the smooth surface as he could. She rewarded him by shaking her butt a little, letting him reposition before dealing with the smothering mass once more. Suddenly she lets out a short fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods, I'm so sorry Francis. I didn't mean to let one slip.\" The elephant woman blushed brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis, not wanting to ruin the moment, tried to soothe her. His words were muffled by the ginormous amount of jiggling assflesh sitting in his lap. \"It's okay babe, it's not that bad. Smells kinda funny.\" He joked, putting a smile back on Rheina's face. Of course a stoner wouldn't have problems with strange smells. With her worries allayed she got back to the action. Her huge elephantine rear shuffled and bounced on top of her date. She knew humans had come to like this 'twerking' as they called it. Though with her size she had to take it a little slower lest she hammer her date flat back there. Judging by the happy little noises escaping from back there Francis was having the time of his life. This gave the elephant an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I could...\" She mused aloud, putting a hand on each of her large asscheeks. She pulled them apart, letting Francis stare at the immaculately clean cleft inbetween. He managed to utter a surprised \"whoah...\" before Rheina sat back down, wedging him between her cheeks. With her curiosity mounting she let go of her rear, the blubbery cheeks enveloping her date. Next she stood up, confirming her belief that she could hold on to him with just her ass. The elephant woman chuckled to herself, feeling Francis wiggling in the narrow confines of her buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina gave her rear a solid rub, massaging the trapped stoner's whole body with the soft walls of assflesh. His little murrs and moans barely escaped the jiggly prison, but she could tell he was having the time of his life. Finally she leaned back, parting her cheeks again to let him slump onto the couch. With his view still dominated by her backside, the elephant woman couldn't help but want to amplify the pleasure.</span></div></div>",

Saliva began to dribble down the side of her cheek. She couldn't wait to feel those wiggles as he went inside of her. But she'd promised him to let him decide when he was ready for such an adventure, a promise that was increasingly difficult to keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn't reply immediately, still catching his breath from that overwhelming full body massage he received. It felt like he had been afloat amidst an ocean of supple assflesh, his every worry drifting away. His only regret is not being allowed in there longer. His smile grows a mile wide when the spirit of gluttony offers him another proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at that face you really seemed to enjoy that, didn't you? Well, would you like to take an even deeper look? And i'm talking all the way up and inside. It's pretty much the same, except a little warmer and even more comfy.\" She gave him her best sales pitch, eagerly hoping for a positive response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoner gave it only a second's thought before agreeing. If she was able to sit that huge butt on top of him without any lasting injury he was confident Rheina would keep him safe inside of her as well. \"Alright, babe, let's do this. I'll go where no man has gone before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina chuckled at his words. He was wrong, but he would become the first man that would probably enjoy the ordeal. She could make her insides as clean or as filthy as she desired, depending on whether she wants to give her victims pleasure or punishment. And her day job rarely involved giving humans pleasure. But Francis deserved all the pleasure he could desire for his efforts so far. Before she let him in she did have one last question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stay packed in my butt for as long as you please. Or I could send you all through my bowels and into my stomach. From there I can cough you up easily. It'd be like getting eaten, but in reverse. Wanna give that a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis mulled over his choices before giving the spirit of gluttony an answer. \"Just let me get accustomed to being in there for a little while, then you can have me travel those big insides of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina squeaked gleefully, eager to show her date just how comfortable she could be on the inside. She pulled her asscheeks apart, letting him stare at that ravenous hole. The stoner sat up, preparing himself to enter. It was still scary to see her pucker descending towards him, but he was determined to see this through. When the soft flesh connected with his head, the clenched ring opened up wide. It took the man in with no difficulty, sinking down until it hit the couch. The spirit stood up, giggling as she felt two legs still dangling from her bottom. She reached back and pushed them in, sealing the little man in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis felt his date give him the final push as the warmth surrounded him completely. The walls were clean save for a little bit of slime and the passage smelled vaguely of her fart from earlier. On the whole he was amazed by how clean it all was. Soon his thoughts would be turned to mush as the walls bore down on him, embracing him in the most thorough and deep massage he'd ever felt. How Rheina was able to do this with her rectum of all places was a mystery, but he was not about to complain. With every squeeze he was completely immobilized, but between them he rewarded her in the only way he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina needed to take a seat as the pleasurable wiggles emanating from inside her sent a rush of joy throughout her large body. She didn't know how he managed it, but Francis was able to hit all the right places. She began to rub herself as finally it was time for him to start his journey. Slowly and surely she began to guide him through her, each squeeze sliding the little man a bit further down her bowels. The smooth intestines were every bit as adept at smothering him in warmth and arousing pressure. Before long she had brought herself to an orgasm, panting loudly as she laid back to focus on the afterglow as well as her date squirming in her belly.</span></div></div>",

When he was texting with her before the date, this wasn't how he was planning to spend time 'close to her'. But all in all it was as odd as it was relaxing. He had no idea how much longer he'd be traveling through this seemingly endless tunnel, but hopefully he'd be outside the elephant woman soon enough. Almost on cue the narrow passage seemed to halt as he bumped into a closed sphincter. The muscular ring opened up, letting him slide into her empty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I feel a morsel in my stomach.\" The spirit of gluttony mused, her voice reverberating inside her hollow gut. Francis gave a hearty chuckle and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do all your dates pass through here or am I lucky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the first human to consider himself to be 'lucky' whilst inside my stomach. Then again, most humans that go there tend to be damned souls in need of torment, not dates that need loving. Speaking of which...\" Rheina took a deep breath and grunted. Francis didn't know what she was up to, but suddenly everything seemed to stir into motion. The walls closed in and the floor shook, the stomach contracting to squeeze its occupant up into the esophagus. The next leg of his journey was a blur for the stoner. Tight coils of muscle tried to push him up and keep him down at the same time. The elephant woman clearly struggled getting him out of her belly like this. Part of him wanted to soothe her and promise to just slide out the natural way. But she was already so close. Brief flashes of light shone up ahead as he was nearing the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single fluid motion the man was forced up her throat and into the spirit's mouth. She closed her lips around his chest to stop Francis from sliding out of her mouth completely. The man was unsure of what his date had in mind, but he would soon find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dhidn'th fink you 'ere dhone, r.. right?\" She sputtered, talking with her mouth full. Francis panicked lightly as he felt those big lips slurping him back inside, puckering up around his head and giving him the strangest kiss before sucking him back into her maw. Already her large tongue had begun to lap away at his body, licking him clean of the slimy juices that coated her stomach and bowels. His body was like putty against the strong muscle, being pushed around with little resistance. She finally had her date where she wanted him and gave him the most thorough tasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the delighted murrs and moans, Rheina was a big fan of his flavor. But Francis worried that her affection might mean another trip into her belly. As much as he loved her, he wouldn't mind spending some more time loving her exterior, not just the insides.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a little more pushing him around with her tongue the playful elephant woman finally let him escape, pursing her lips around Francis' waist to slowly drop him into her waiting hands. She didn't care that he was drenched in saliva and other juices. What peaked her interest much more was the little bulge in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's having a good time...\" She cooed, giving the bulge a sniff with her trunk. \"How about you take those pants off for me, sweetie? Or should I try myself with my teeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis gulped at the notion of those big chompers near his manhood. He sprung into action, trying to drop his pants before the impatient monster would try to help. When his fly was open she came in close, opening her maw wide and taking in his lower legs. She slurped and suckled, pulling his pants down and revealing his package. But that wasn't enough for the spirit of gluttony. She kept going until she'd removed his pants completely, taking them into her maw before sending them down with a loud gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't digest my pants... I like them and I haven't brought a spare.\" He spoke softly and only sort of jokingly, unsure of what to make of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm just keeping them safe for you. I'll let you in to get them back later.\" She said with a giggle. Of course retrieving his clothes would involve her eating him. He practically expected it. At this stage he just shrugged and went all in, taking off his shorts and shirt and presenting them to his date. She gobbled them up quickly before letting her gaze fall back on his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the real meal.\" She mused, pursing her lips and leaning in. Francis was hesitant to let those big jaws near his sensitive shaft. Rheina felt his little struggles and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, you wouldn't try to get between a spirit of gluttony and her next meal, right?\" She said cheerily, making her date relax and resign himself to her. She quickly sent him cross-eyed with arousal as her thick lips pressed down on his cock. It stood no chance as the overwhelmingly stimulating lips played with it. They squeezed, suckled and slurped on the little shaft. It was hard to wring much goodness out of something this small, but the way he was now bucking to push it in deeper was simply too adorable. He squirted out a minute load by Rheina's standards, but she still eagerly gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... tasty.\" She complimented, making him blush. \"Now, would you like to try and return the favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis looked up to his date and raised a curious eyebrow. \"How could I possibly pleasure you? You're huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you already know...\" She said mysteriously. The stoner still didn't understand what she was referring to until she sat back a little and parted her legs. Suddenly her interest became all too clear and with a pang of hesitation he was lowered down to her crotch. If there was any shame left in him after that blowjob it all evaporated at the sight of the enormous elephantine pussy. It was utterly drenched in pungent slime, a small trickle leaking out like a river. She had been every bit as aroused by this as him, and likely far more to boot. Words to describe her horniness failed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since I've felt a man wriggle in my bowels like you did...\" She cooed, putting him down right in front of her snatch. \"Go on, have fun. Do with me as you please.\" She fought back the urge to moan at saying those words. Francis was shocked to hear this powerful beast beckoning him to ravage her like that. It seemed almost too good to be true. But the pussy in front of him looked as hungry as the rest of Rheina. There was no doubt in his mind that it would try swallow him whole if it got the chance. Admittedly, given how survivable the spirit's insides were it might not be the worst place to be, but making her lose control further might put his health at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd come too far to back down now. He straightened himself up and approached the elephant woman's pussy, eager to provide both of them an unforgettable experience. Rheina panted and moaned, ready for her date to blow her mind.</span></div></div>",

She was so on edge already it didn't seem like it would take much to achieve a climax. Even someone as small as him might pull it off. But when faced with a pussy that large it was painfully clear he'd need to think outside the box. His dick wasn't going to do much. He kept rubbing the slippery folds, occasionally giving her clit a gentle massage, eliciting a moan from up above. Rheina tried to guide him, but most of her words were scrambled by waves of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing else for it. He already imagined this was going to happen one way or another. Even if her whole shtick wasn't centered around hunger of all kinds, it seemed unlikely someone as enormous as her was going to be satisfied any other way. Francis shot her a knowing smile before sitting down in front of her womanhood. He used his feet to massage the folds for a brief moment before committing to his plan. With a subtle squelch he slid them between the pulsing walls, feeling a narrow tunnel and sticking them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah!\" Rheina cried out. She didn't expect him to actually do this on his own. The elephant woman was fine with letting him play around before taking charge herself and inserting him. But this was so much better. To feel the little man working his way inside of her on his own. She leaned back, spreading her thick legs wide and giving him all the room he could want to complete his act. She moaned again when his legs pushed in deeper. It felt spectacular. By now half his body was squirming inside her love tunnel. But a spirit of gluttony is always hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis propped himself up, ready to slowly slide in more of himself. Suddenly he felt the insides of Rheina's pussy stir. The wet walls bore down on him, squeezing his legs. This was nothing new, but now he could feel himself being pulled in a little with each squeeze. He tried not to spoil the intimacy by laughing, but of course even her pussy was a ravenous orifice capable of swallowing things. The stoner smiled, knowing the rest of his plan would be a lot easier now. Slowly the large netherlips drew closer as the elephant woman steadily sucked her date up her snatch. It only stopped when everything but his head was inside. Finally she had gathered enough words to form a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little man.\" She cooed before pulling the last of him inside. Once her prey was swallowed the elephant woman relaxed, but shortly thereafter a jolt of electricity shot through her. He had come to life inside of her, thrashing and squirming wildly. She was flush with arousal, responding with her pussy bearing down on him and soaking him in her feminine juices. Moaning loudly, the spirit of gluttony felt pleasure in ways she rarely ever got to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her first orgasm hit she cried out with unrestrained bliss, the windows in her house rattling from the volume. Her immense pussy bore down on the little man inside, pushing him out partially in a torrent of her release. He sputtered and coughed, only his head and shoulders popping out from the twitching lower lips. Rheina looked down at him, her face filled with satisfaction as well as a small pang of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh. That was amazing. But were you okay in there? You were starting to go wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" He replied with a cocky grin. \"Nothing less is gonna do it for you, ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina gave him a sly smirk. Francis didn't need to guess what would happen next. He gave her a nod and in mere moments the hungry pussy swallowed him up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime after time he squirmed wildly like a struggling helpless victim in the jaws of her ravenous monster pussy. She let her snatch 'chew' on its prey before another powerful orgasm overtook her. After a while she stopped even checking in on him, knowing he was just fine with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis had a joyous smile on his face. This was without a doubt the strangest kind of sex he'd ever had. But the sheer enormity of everything around him also made it with a distance the best sex of his life. The arousing scent all around him, the soft, smooth walls. The full-body massage whenever they bore down on him. For each orgasm he felt rushing through his date he added one of his own. His overstimulated dick squirting out a mere drop in the lake of her juices. He felt the walls around him stir again, but this time they pushed him out. His head emerged from her pussy and he looked up to see Rheina, haggard and spent. She was as tired as him, but smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're amazing, little man.\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you.\" Francis replied, unable to think of anything wittier to say in his current state.</span></div></div>",

It all felt so good she almost wishes she could keep going forever. But little Francis is still only mortal. With a gleeful smile the next best thing comes to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, sweetie. Do you need to get back home? If you want you can stay here for the night too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis gives her a big smile. \"I've not got anything planned for tomorrow, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\" Rheina exclaimed, before her expression sank down into a concerned frown. \"Small problem though, I've not really got a guest room for you. I don't get a whole lot of guests in hell after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoner wiggled a little, sending a small wave of pleasure through his date's body. \"I'm sure you can improvise a sleeping bag of some kind...\" He said with a cocky smile. She gave him a knowing look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go to bed, wanna watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna stay in there?\" Rheina asked suggestively. It felt great to have the little guy stuffed in her snatch, his every movement eliciting more pleasure from her. It took the little man hilariously little time to nod in agreement, though he did have one issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you turn me around? Kinda hard to enjoy the movie when everything's upside down.\" Francis gave her a goofy smirk. She laughed and with a little effort realigned the man lodged in her pussy so he could enjoy the movie with her. She picked out a favorite from her collection, a campy horror film called Anaconda. Francis had seen it before but he was always up for some cheesy movie. It only seemed expected for him that Rheina's favorite movie was about a monster snake that swallowed things whole. But as they watched he noticed that the version she had was a little different. Many of the most gruesome scenes were drawn out even further, showing in detail how the snake feasted on the unfortunate humans. Many of the old scenes also seemed to have been redone with almost lifelike effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a director's cut or something? I don't recall this film being quite so... graphic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we tend to re-shoot some scenes down here in hell. And since we can conjure up just about anything and have an infinite supply of damned souls ready to be the victim... let's just say this version doesn't have any special effects in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis wasn't sure how to feel about it, but he couldn't deny that apparently hell had a great sense of cinema. Even a campy cheesefest like this movie could be turned into something more disturbing. As time went on though, the stoner realized there was another monster he had to contend with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina's pussy had been calm, letting the little man watch the movie in peace. But with each death on screen the elephant woman got a little more aroused. She seemed eager to re-enact the scenes of people being swallowed whole, her love tunnel pulling the man inside. The spirit of gluttony was always quick to push him back out so he could enjoy the movie, but she couldn't deny how good it felt. Francis didn't seem to mind it all that much, happily wiggling inside of her to coax her hungry snatch into releasing enough of him to continue watching. The little game slowly overtook their interest in the movie and by the time the final minutes rolled around he was quoting the villain word for word before the hungry monster swallowed him up. He thrashed around, pretending to fight for his life as the pussy bore down on him. The stoner let himself go limp, acting like the monster pussy has crushed the life out of him like the snake from the movie. It felt amazing, the elephant woman no longer able to hold herself back and letting out a loud moan. Her climax was intense enough to carry the little man halfway out, giving him the freedom to move his arms for the first time in hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used this newfound leverage to turn himself around, his legs still swirling around in her snatch. The inner walls proved unwilling to release him. It was getting late and both of them were feeling sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've not got a bed spare, but maybe you can sleep on the couch?\" She said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you've got more options than that...\" Francis mused, putting a mischievous smirk on Rheina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you'd say that... So which part of me do you want to sleep in?\"</span></div></div>",

But his suggestion wasn't wrong. Her round gut even rumbled a little to confirm it. She gave him a lewd smile and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but first you'll have to free yourself from that affectionate tunnel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis smiled at the challenge laid out before him. He could already feel the inner workings of the spirit of gluttony bracing themselves to inhibit his escape. He had to act fast before she'd slurp him right back up. His feeble kicks did nothing but arouse her. That's when the lightbulb in his head finally turned on. Playfully or otherwise, Rheina had already demonstrated she could overpower any efforts to fight his way out. But he was in this position instead of fully swallowed up because she'd hit a climax. One more and he'd be free. His eyes locked onto their target. Her glistening pleasure button. He reached out to it and took hold of the small fleshy nub with both hands. Immediately it felt like he'd electrocuted his date, a shockwave of pleasure rushing through her and shaking up his world. She moaned loudly, encouraging him to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina couldn't believe the amount of sheer, unfiltered sexual fun she was able to draw from this eager little man. She'd forced damned souls to please her, but their fearful attempts didn't come close to someone who was sincerely trying to make her the happiest demon in hell. Francis' little hands worked feverishly, making it increasingly difficult to keep him pinned in place. When his lips graced her clit she knew it was game over. With a howling moan she unleashed another flood on her couch, pushing the rest of her date outside. He'd succeeded in defeating her challenge with style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you go to hell, I'll make sure you get your own personal heaven.\" She mumbled, the stoner laughing along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I go to heaven, I'll demand the big guy upstairs let you in too.\" He added, earning a long \"Awwww...\" From Rheina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've spent the last few hours in the company of a demon, fucking her several times over.\" The spirit mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spent the last few hours making love to the greatest woman I've ever known, providing as much as I could to sate her every need. If that's not good enough for heaven, I'll take your company in hell over that.\" He said theatrically. She reached down and picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've still got one need to sate, little man.\" She said seductively, opening her maw wide. He smiled, giggling a little as her large tongue lapped away at the thick slime coating his body. Her pleased hums let him know she was a fan of her own product. With most of her feminine juices lapped away she paid some extra attention to his manhood. The squishy tongue flicked and teased it, drawing a small spurt from him. She was impressed that he still had any left to give after being marinated in her arousing juices for hours. Finally she brought him in for the main event. Her pursed lips wrapped around his feet as she slowly and sensually slurped him inside. They exchanged one last amorous glance before he slipped past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were already on their way down her gullet when she pressed and squeezed him lightly with her tongue. She savoured the taste for just a moment longer before a large gulp sent him halfway down her throat. A second gulp sealed the deal and she held a hand on her neck to feel her little morsel sliding down into her spacious belly. Francis landed with a splash, the slimy juices in her stomach feeling warm and welcoming. The smell was almost pleasant. Either she was working her dark trickery or he really was getting used to it after spending so much time inside his date. The large, fleshy chamber moved as she walked to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, little Francis.\" She mumbled as she laid herself down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, my love.\" He answered, unsure if she could hear him from inside her gut. As his environment came to rest he laid himself down on the soft, slimy surface. He managed to find a spot away from the pool of juices in the pit of her stomach, yawning loudly before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't the most gentle wake-up call, but he felt thoroughly rested all the same. He was soaked from head to toe in slimy goop though. The fleshy chamber began to wobble a little as his date got up on her feet and started walking around. He could hear her heavy footfalls as she walked over to the bathroom, seemingly not carign about the ride she was giving him in there. Did she forget about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead, did you enjoy your luxury bedroom?\" She cooed, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis reached over and rubbed one of the walls, replying \"You bet, it's great in here.\" He still wasn't sure if she could hear him, but at least the gentle rubbing should indicate to her how he's feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" She murred. \"I'm gonna take a quick shower, you just stay put. You can keep doing that though, it's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stoner nodded, still running his hand along the slimy surface of her stomach. He could hear her stepping into the shower. The water raining down actually sounded really calming, like rain on a roof. Entranced by the strange beauty Francis almost stops, but he's brought back to reality when Rheina starts twisting and stretching in the shower to get all of her hefty form cleaned. It took some time for her to tend to her large gut, patting it once more. But it was time for her little belly prisoner to be released. She hurked and gagged and in record time the little man came flying out of her mouth, caught in two strong hands. He blushed a little as she set him down in the shower. The water was still running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go and wash up too. Oh, and before I forget it...\" She said, gagging again. She spat out a weird lump. It landed at Francis' feet, coated in yellowish slime. It took him a moment to recognize, but they were his clothes, the ones she swallowed during their date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks dude. I was worried I'd have to get new ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, anytime. Now get yourself cleaned and dressed.\" She said, leaving the bathroom to get some food in the kitchen. Francis wouldn't keep her waiting for long. The shower gave him some time to reminisce as he washed her stomach juices of himself and his clothes. He sort of expected these things to happen. She did after all mention being a spirit of gluttony frequently during their texts before the date. Mercifully his precautions put her in a good mood and the date went well. It wasn't too much of a stretch to believe he'd be digested if she wasn't so pleased with him. But that sense of danger just made her more attractive in his eyes. She was a woman unlike anything he could've ever imagined, and not just because of her elephantine features and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of daydreaming in the shower he finished up and joined Rheina in the kitchen. She was predictably stuffing her face with snacks. Though she was busily munching on them she reached down, offering him a bag of chips. Francis raised a curious brow at the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said never get between a spirit of gluttony and their food, what's it mean when one shares their food with you?\" He asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means stop overthinking things and dig in, silly.\" She replied with her mouth full. He was kind of hungry, so with a shrug he took a handful of chips, calmly munching them as Rheina emptied the rest of the bag in her cavernous maw. After her morning feast was finished she turned to him, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Francis... I believe this is the part where we part ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude, I guess... But I had loads of fun here, you know. We should definitely plan another date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... uhm... I don't want to sound too pushy, but... did you have any plans for today?\" She asked, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Nah, I guess I don't. Oh hey, that means I can stay here, right?\" He jumped on the situation, wanting to save his date some embarrassment. She looked relieved not to have to ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would be so sweet.\" She cooed. But there was more she wanted to say. The elephant woman fidgeted nervously for a second before just spitting out what was on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I invite some friends over? They'd all love to meet you, maybe even play with you if you're comfortable with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're as cute as you are, sure. Though maybe that's setting the bar too high.\" Francis replied with a cheesy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, stop it you. Or you'll be stuffed somewhere inside me before they even get here.\" She jokingly mutters whilst grabbing her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't threaten me with a good time.\" The stoner laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRheina giggled at her date, then called her friends on the phone. They arrived moments later, teleporting right up to her front door and ringing the bell. Francis nearly lost it when he learned that the doorbell was just a loud burp. There were so many odd little details about Rheina and he couldn't wait to learn more about her.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A new app has crept up from some dark corner of the internet promising its users the ability to date all manner of monsters, be it ancient myths and legends or other strange creatures of fantasy. Discarded mostly as a prank or some elaborate hoax, only a few people have found it so far and have given it a try. Those who took the plunge also soon discovered that monster standards for a 'date' can differ wildly from their expectations. Will they even survive their romantic encounters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Everyone involved is 18+, no underage characters<br>\r\n2: Gore is alright, but try not to go overboard with gratuitous descriptions<br>\r\n3: No Scat/watersports<br>\r\n4: Characters can die, but don't kill them off too quickly. Give the date a few chapters worth of story before hitting the fatal conclusion.<br>\r\n5: Let's avoid pre-established characters for now. Import species and such as you will, but don't haul in characters from other franchises. I may relax this rule later when there's more chapters, but for now attempt to create your own monsters and people.<br>\r\n6: Dates need not be straight. M/M, F/F and more are all welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions about this interactive, feel free to send me an e-mail.</td>",
