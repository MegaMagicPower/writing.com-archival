You and everyone else in the house are going to be cleaning out the attic today. Quickly you shower, get dressed and head up the stairs where your Mother, Andrea, and Alyssa are waiting. Andrea is sitting in an old chair checking out her nails while your Mother and Alyssa are searching through some boxes. \"Hey!\" Andrea says smiling at you and gives you a wave. You wave back and nod as your sister and Mom turn around to spot you. \"Don't just stand there, search through those boxes over their please? We have to decide what stays and what goes to goodwill.\" your mother said as she continued to rummage. Andrea continued to sit their and idolize her self, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a secret, you always wanted to be shrunken or transformed into something and used. It was silly, but exciting. The only person in the world who knew this was Andrea. You two shared everything.

Hours passed before you all finished the attic and then afterwards went down to eat. Your mother prepared spaghetti as you sat beside Andrea and across from Samantha. Eating quietly, your Mother of course talked about her day and asked usual questions to each of you. A few laughs were shared along with a small argument, but other than that it was a normal day. Samantha finished first and went to her room, then Andrea, you were last along with your Mother and you helped her with the dishes. Smiling to you she told you how much of a \"Good Boy\" you were and you chuckled. \"Mom, you make me feel like I'm a dog and not your son!\" you said to her laughing and she hugged you. \"Awww, my special baby boy, even if you were just a dog I'd still love you and take care of you... \" *She said kissing your cheek and smiling. You playfully fought against her and laughed once more, \"Yeah but I'm not a dog!\" you said sticking out your tongue playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie, but I wish you...\"</span></div></div>",

I just wish that I had a little man to take care of again *giggles*\" You hear stuff like this from your mother all the time and more so recently since your sister is going off to school and you are just getting older.

Ha ha well I know one thing that won't be going away any time soon and that's dirty dishes\".

Being confused you automatically assume she think's your naked under your blanket. So you take off the blanket, begin to get out of bed as you say \"What mom? I'm wearing my pajm...\" You stop talking as your feet hit the floor, your pant's and boxers fall off you and your only clothing is a shirt that is so much bigger on you that it cover's everything down below. Turning your head up you see your mother whose expression has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's face can be described just like as she begin's talking to you saying \"Awe, look at you your just to cute!!\". You are then lifted in the air. You try struggling at first but found that your mother's strength out match's your's by a lot. She clearly has all the power in the situation as she begin's to coochie coo at you. She then follows it up with taking you into her arm's and cradling you like a baby against her massive boob she say's \"Awe I remember when I got to hold you like this all the time. You just so cute!!!\". At this point your sort of getting upset. All this baby talk is just making you angry and so you just come out and say \"Okay okay, that's enough mom. This is humiliating, I don't know how this happened but we need to do something about it\". In which your mom responds with \"Awe but your just so cute like this\" and you say back \"MOM!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom noticing this is upsetting you say's \"Okay I get it\". She then put's you down on the ground a little disappointed, then says \"Okay so what do we do?\". You think for a moment and then say \"Idk call a doctor or something\". Your mom then give's you a sarcastic look \"And then what say ...Hey my son shrunk... They would think I was crazy\". You knew she was right and then had to ask \"Okay well do you have any idea's?\". Your mother suddenly get's happy but does not show it as she say's \"Well you will just stay like this. And it will most probably just wear off and you will be back to normal, okay?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just thought this wasn't a very good idea, but with really no other plan of action you just say \"Yea I guess your right...\".

But your mom now has other plans for the item's inside that bin, as she opens it up and take's out some cloth's that you wore as a young child. She then gave you a a big grin that you responded with \"no no no...\" But that was pointless as she say's \"You need cloth's and these are the only one's that are going to fit you so put them on now or I will put them on you myself\". Since you didn't want that you just went and pt the cloth's on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom just looked at you and \"Awe look at my dapper little man. So cute, now let's go\". She say's everything so quickly that yo have no way to retaliate to her cute comment's as she picks you up and take's you to the car. You then watch as your mom locks the front door and then opens the back door door to her dodge mini van. As the door slides open, you see the car seat that you all never got around to taking out of your mom's car. Your mom then begins sitting you in it and you say angrily \"HEY, STOP I'm not sitting in this. Let me out of this thing\". Your mo just continue's to over power you and once she was done locking you in she say's \"No way little man. You are much to small to be riding in a big boy seat, maybe when your older *giggles*\" she then closes the door over and get's in the driver seat to begin her drive. All the while you sat there dumb founded that your mom is really committing to this joke of you being a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your mom's thought's she love's that your this size and that she can treat you like a child. As she drive's to the mall, thinking about all the cute thing's she now get you into. You guy's soon arrive at the mall and your mom parks the car and then come's around to let you out of your car seat. She then say's to you \"Okay listen your going to have to act like a baby while being in public. It's the easiest way to make this an in and out thing okay?\". You really hate the idea of being treated like a child but decide that she is right and agree. So your taken out and eventually put into a race-car shopping cart. It is really embarrassing for you, especially having to sit in a seat where your mom's boob's are a few inches from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it got worse a you expected that once you entered the clothing store that you would be let out to pick out your own clothing. But instead once you two entered the children's clothing store, you had to sit in the shopping cart while watching your mother run around and pick out your clothing for you just like she did when you were actually a child. And you knew you couldn't say anything about it since you agreed to act like a baby for now. So, she did all your shopping for you and went to the counter to purchase the cloth's. You then got another embarrassing moment as the clerk saw you and talk to your mom about how cute you were. It was a 5 min conversation that you felt like it was much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your mom left the store with you in the cart. And you just wanting all this to end say \"Mom, Can we leave now?\". In which she responded with \"Oh come on aren't you having fun *giggles*.....But okay fine we can go home just let me try to remember which way the parking garage is?*giggles*\". You can't tell when she is joking or not and that is starting to make you mad. But you just stay silent as your mom looks around the mall and...</font></span></div></div>",

Just know I love you and would do anything for you *puppy dog face*\". Once that last thing was said with the puppy dog look you were locked in and very angrily agreed to just get this over with. She went into the store after you agreed. And then seeing that the aisle's weren't big enough for the cart she decided  leave you in front of a set of aisle's. She told you where she will be and that it will only take a second. So, your mom walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that it was going to be much longer then a second. So, given really no other choice, you just look around for something to do. You realized very quickly that the spot you were in was a very popular place for people to leave there cart with a child in it while the parent shopped. And given the fact that there was a clerk who could easily watch the cart's the spot was just fine to be in. Some time passed and ended up right next to a cart that look's very similar to your's with a child who sort of resembled your appearance but you didn't notice that last part. You really only noticed the cart and the girl who was pushing it. She looked to be about 14 or 15, half-Asian, and seemed to talk to the child in the cart like he is her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe essentially told her young brother the same thing your mom told you, as she went off to go shopping for shoe's.

Seeing him you already knew what this guy's plan was and usually when this happens to you mom you can either walk away or make her leave. But seeing that your \"just a baby\" here. You have to sit through this mess of a situation that usually end's with the guy walking away depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry to brother you, but saw you from the food court and you looked lost. Do you need direction's?\" The guy say's to your mom who being naive of the situation responds with \"Oh yes, could you point me in the direction of the parking garage it would be super helpful\". In which the guy say's back to her \"Yea I was actually just about to head back toward's my car. So how about we just walk there together?\". Seeing that this is usually when your mom turns the guy down, you sat there waiting for her response which is \"Of course that would be great\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she then begins pushing the cart your in while paying no attention to you as the guy begins to talk and flirt \"So, um my name's Ryan what's your's and whose little cute guy\". You didn't like hearing that from him, but just sat there and listened to what your mother says next \"Oh my name is Gina and this little cutie is my son *your name*\". Ryan then continues the conversation \"Oh cute name for the both you *haha*, you know I'm a teacher at a local elementary school. I just love children\" This sounded like something that was out of a bad romance movie but your mom was just going with it saying \"Oh really, I use to be a teacher. I taught math what about you?\". She ask this right as they reach the parking garage and Ryan give's his response \"No way I also teach math, small world *haha*, you know I hope this isn't to forward but seeing that were at your car. It would be cool if I could see you again, like tonight for dinner?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered when this guy was going to get shoot his shot. And you were glad that he finally did so your mother could finally end this movie scene with a hard no way. But looking  at your mom it seemed that she looked sort of interested in the guy.

And then she finally speak's \"Now listen I know your going to be upset. But I love having you as my baby and seeing as your stuck like this for the time being.It's only right if you are treated like a baby in till you grow back. I am the adult here and in till you grow I am responsible for making sure you are taken care of Im sorry but it's settled that you are my baby. And as for the babysitter your to small, cute, and adorable to take care of yourself so you need one.
