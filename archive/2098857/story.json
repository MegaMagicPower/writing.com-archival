Simple wooden cabinets lined one of the walls, and a mahogany table stood in the middle of the room, with a cardboard box sitting on it. Raising an eyebrow, the princess walked over to the table and opened the box. Her eyes widened in surprise as she pulled out an Assist Trophy. \"Why is this here?\" she asked, looking it over. She remembered these strange magical items from the Smash Bros tournaments, but this one seemed different somehow. Looking in the box, she found a note. \"Bring forth anyone of your choosing,\" she read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thinking over it, Zelda held the Assist Trophy out and thought about who she wanted to \"bring forth,\" as the note said.

She reached into the tree's maw, pulling out a polished chest! She opened it, finding a corked vial with an odd blue liquid. On it was a piece of tape reading 'G-11' which peaked curiosity.</span></div></div>",

A thin stream of steam was pouring out of the top of the volcano which looked to be only a mile away or so.  The sexy succubus also saw a building about half a mile away.  Morrigan shrugged and headed towards the building <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The building turned out to be a hot spring spa. She entered the building's lobby to discover a sleeping human male at the reception desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Morrigan walked over to the sleeping human and cleared her throat very loudly.  The human, who had red hair and probably in his early twenties, jerked awake and stared at Morrigan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes?\" Purred Morrigan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Er, welcome to our hot springs spa\" said the man and Morrigan smiled at the look of utter revelence the man was giving her.  She wasn't even flirting and he was obviously turned on. Morrigan has that effect on mortals regardless of gender.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So this is where I go to get wet?\" Purred Morrigan using a sultry bedroom voice that clearly made the man's knees buckle. \"What's your name, love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jonathan\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, Jonathan\" said Morrigan.  \"I just came off the boat and decided I need a nice long soak after such long voyage.

Towa looked down at her hands, and saw her forearms slowly getting thicker, veins revealing themselves through her skintight body suit. Her eyes widened in surprise, as her upper arms began to grow as well. Her aura flared slightly, her legs thickening and her stomach hardening. Even her chest was slowly growing, her pecs pushing out her breasts as they  grew to a D-cup, her nipples fully erect and threatening to pierce her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling within began to become warmer, as another wave shook the demon scientist. Her aura flared again, as the growth began to speed up. She wasn't even flexing, and already her arms were as big as her head, straining her suit to its limit. Thick veins pulsed through the rubber, feeding her growing muscles. Feeling as though the growth wasn't happening quick enough, she recalled a technique she had seen being used by the Saiyans and Cell. Concentrating, she allowed her ki to flow into her muscles, amplifying the effects of the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned loudly as another wave rocked her, the speed of the growth picking up. Her suit was finally losing its battle against her muscles, rips and tears exposing her blue skin as her muscles contracted and bulged, her body slowly growing taller to accomodate her increasing mass. Her hips widened, her torso containing so much muscle that it stopped having a V shape and began taking on a distorted Y shape. Countless muscles lined the sides of her stomach, as her abdominals bulged, twelve blocks of steel the size of her growing fists. Her ass grew and grew, ensuring that her feminine assets weren't completely overlooked, the twin globes of muscle easily two feet across each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 YES!\u201d she cried, clenching her fists and flexing her arms. With a loud <i>rrrrriiiiiipppp</i>, her sleeves burst apart, her biceps and triceps ballooning in size, her arms easily thicker than most men\u2019s torsos. Her forearms bulged, thicker than what her legs used to be. Her swelling deltoids, rising traps and engorging chest threatened to swallow her head, the only thing stopping them being her neck, which had lengthened and thickened to a size that would make a bull jealous. Her thighs had decimated her leggings, twin pillars of power that were touching without even being flexed and that led down to calves bigger than hams and harder than diamonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowa relaxed her muscles for a moment, before forcing as much of her ki into her growing bulk as she could manage. The scientist screamed in pleasure, her entire body flexing at once as what was left of her bodysuit exploded off of her. Her colossal thighs rubbed her engorged pussy, her eyes widening in surprise as wave after wave of pleasure shook her. Her aura went wild as she finally came, juices shooting out of her cunt as her body swelled even larger, her traps brushing against the ceiling. \u201cOH GODS, THIS POWER IS AMAZING!\u201d she cried out, cumming again and again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She appeared to be in a fairly large lobby that had went to complete hell: the floor was strewn with debris of all kinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is pleasant\" said Aqua looking around. There was a sign above the receptionists desk that said in big bold letters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       <b> Mount Sanguine Research Center</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Aqua raised her eyebrows and decided to walk down the long hallway next to the wide desk.

Each vial wasn't labeled at all <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of these are labeled?\" Scoffed Aqua. \"That sounds quite irresponsible\"   Aqua found no other information about the ten vials or what liquid they contained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was thirst that convinced Aqua to test out one of the vials.

Her mind was a sensory overload as she sensed all the people in the world: their every thought, their every fear.  Aqua had only taken a tiny sip but that was enough for the transformation to occur.  Her body now radiated a golden light; her hair had turned from blue to pure white and her eyes were depthless.  Aqua had dropped the vial in surprise and alarm, shattering it.  Aqua stepped back from the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What happened to me?!\" yelled Aqua.  Her voice had an frightening echo now and it reverberated with power that seemed to make the very air tremble. The lab also dimmed for a second or two then returned to its normal lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It took Aqua another minute to realize a rather startling fact: she was now a goddess.  There was no other explanation for how she could sense all the people in the world and what they were thinking. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   \"Hey, who's in there?\"  asked a voice.  Aqua turned to see that a man in a white lab coat had entered the lab.  The man had red hair and a weak chin.  He also was wearing glasses. As soon as he looked at her, he immediately bowed down to her.  \"Oh dear.....You must've drank one of those vials\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Indeed I have\" said Aqua.  <br>\r\n    \"Good thing it's only temporary\" said the man.  \"You're a goddess for twenty-four hours.

I'm only a lowly assistant though\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So I shall return to normal by tomorrow then?\" asked Aqua.  Henry nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"...how could a simple serum turn me into a God?\" asked Aqua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That serum was the result of the research of the Hyper Emeralds.....stones of immense power.  Bits of the Emerald were contained in the vial you drank, thus giving you temporary godhood\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Are you saying that these Hyper Emeralds could grant permanent godhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Henry shrugged.  \"We don't know that much about the Emeralds to be honest.....at least I don't.  They're scattered everywhere on the island\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"With this power I could free Ven and Terra from the darkness....\" said Aqua.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"That's not entirely correct\" said Henry.  \"The power of the Emeralds only work on this island.....we don't know why or how\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"A handicap then\" sighed Aqua.  \"However....I don't need to leave the island to do that\" here, Aqua raised her hand and concentrated.  It took Aqua a full minute to do what she was seeking to do.  Her eyes opened and smiled.....and that's when she noticed that Henry had leff the room....and he had taken all of the vials with him.  She thought about going after him.  </span></div></div>",

I thought-\" Peach couldn't finish her sentence as Rosalina shoves her into a mountain sending Peach in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like my body, Peach?\" Rosalina flexes again, \"I've seen you've gotten some height, but I have power, ahh, it feels soooo go doesn't it?\" She puts a foot on the middle of Peaches back and then begins to force one of her legs up and past her head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"R-ROSALINA STOP, I-IT HURTS!!! Peach pleads, but her pleads fall on deaf ears. Rosalina still absorbed in her new raw power begins to crush peach under her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmm, yes, yes, yeeeessss, you're about to be crushed underneath me,\" Rosalina licked her lips again, but before she can officially finish off peach, a force tackles her from her position. Whoever this was, she didn't care, all Rosalina wanted was to crush them. She sent a strike towards the woman's side, causing the woman to flinch, this was all Rosalina needed and she managed to flip her over revealing it to be...</span></div></div>",

Rosalina sent a right hook across her face, then a left, then another right, before Tracer managed to kick Rosalina off of her, they both stumbled into their fighting positions, Rosalina noting that Tracer as at least 10 ft taller than her, she glanced back over towards the still laid out Peach, if she got up,that could spell trouble, thinking quickly she grabbed a nearby boulder, crushed it to dust before throwing it at Tracer's face momentarily blinding her. Rosalina had to act quickly she turned heel and ran, reaching her home base. She reached into the cave and grabbed all the remaining candies, devouring them all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer could only stare in wonder as Rosalina grew, her breasts, ass, muscles, and height all grew. She now towers over Tracer at 70 ft tall, and remarkably huge breasts and ass. Her eyes wild, she flexed, veins popping, and with one hard kick, caused Tracer to be eradicated, re-spawning somewhere off on the island. Rosalina then turns her attention toward Peach, and with a quick stomp sent her to a point as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina basked in her triumph, nothing could stand in her way, laughing maniacally, her power was unmatched it was remarkable, nothing can stop her now!!! Is what she thought until she was completely vaporized by a force unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina awoke, and even though she had just awoken she could tell that she had lost most of her power, She was at the re-spawn center. She was much too large for this bed, her ass spilled off the sides, and the entirety of her legs went off the end. She checked her muscles and found she was still quite muscular. She then heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, competitor you died! This is the re-spawn center where you get patched up from death! Now you may be wondering, why am I not a freakishly huge monster lady that can literally destroy mountains with a finger? That's because whenever you re-spawn your stats reset depending on how many contestants you brutally murdered! Now even if you don't kill anyone this turn, you'll revert back to this state, until of course you'll defeat a contestant, and depending on the danger level, your base stats will increase, now get out there and murder everyone in your way!\" Rosalina, looked at the other beds, seeing both Tracer and Peach lying there, completely normal as well as a few others the only key difference was that they were wearing patients gowns, as she was a well, though hers only covered her breasts, in a combo of how large her breasts were and the fact that she was about 15 ft tall still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to go where to go?\"</span></div></div>",

Even though it probably won't last long here!\" Smiling deviously Rosalina browsed the clothing eventually coming across some nice jean short-shorts and a light blue t-shirt. She smiled looking in the mirror, the Jean shorts only covered part of her ass, leaving some spilling out from the bottom, and her shirt only barely covered her breasts leaving a wondrous view of her abs. She flexed eyeing herself in the mirror before finally heading outside.The beach's air smelt of the sea, and the sky was gray, showing that rain would soon be upon her, she found it best to keep moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving wandered for about an hour now, the rain finally began, drenching the woman. She looked for a place to seek shelter and soon found a shack. She rushed in there and slamming the door, turning around she found a gun pointed towards her face, the gun of Widowmaker. Widowmaker had gone through come changes as well, standing at 11 ft and having breasts too large for her suit to contain, rivaling Rosalina's own. Her ass, which had always been impressive, was large enough that the seams of her suit were beginning to split and while not nearly as large as Rosalina's, her muscles were formidable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjour,\" Widowmaker greeted before firing. However Rosalina grabbed the rifle forcing it to the side, causing the bullet to hit her shoulder, only leaving a bruise. Rosalina then ripped the rifle away from Widowmaker, tearing it in half. Then she grabbed her by the throat and forced her to the ground. But Widow wouldn't give up that easy, and with her high heel landed a straight kick into Rosalina's abdomen causing her to back up a bit. Widow attempted to recover, but Rosalina sent a kick across her face sending her back down. Again grabbing her by the throat Rosalina uses her height advantage, bringing Widow up to eye level as she chocked her. Then Widow brought a knee to Rosalina's side, then again, and again, before finally Rosalina dropped her. Then Widow popped something like a pill in her mouth. Moaning Widow grew in size to 15 ft, her muscles and breasts grew ending at just a bit smaller than Rosalina's, her ass ballooned being larger than Rosalina's. When all was said and done, her suit was in tatters, exposing her glorious body to all, she smiled and licked her lips before sending a hard right hook across Rosalina's face, quickly regaining her Rosalina sent a sharp kick into Widow's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're strong,\" Rosalina said a smile spreading across her face, \"But I will be the strongest!!\" Sending a flurry of punches at Widow, Rosalina screams in near pleasure as she begins to ruthlessly pummel Widow, who only manged to deflect the first few. Widow launched through the shack unconscious but not dead, so she wouldn't re-spawn. Rosalina rummages through the remains of the shed, and finds some sort of drink, drinking it in one swig she doesn't notice anything at first, but then she felt electric, looking down, she she that her legs have more muscle to them, but not to a point where they're disproportionate to her upper body, she then grabs her hands, feeling the Jean shorts tighten, and while they don't burst, they hardly even cover the top of her ass anymore. She also grabs her hair, realizing it's grown much longer, the bangs covering her eye reach the top of her breasts now, and her overall hair length reaches at just the top of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, wonder what that means,\" She jumps up and down, realizing that she can jump higher than before, and as she jogs about, she realizes that not only her speed, but her reflexes are faster. Rosalina also finds a large battleaxe grabbing it she finds it's meant for a being larger than her, but decides to keep it. She strolls toward Widow with her new ax at the ready, and brings it down on her head, evaporating her to dust like the others she 'killed'. Offhandedly wondering how strong she'll be when they next meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina strolls through the forest, yawning, before hitting her head on a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? She looks down to she sees a door, meant for someone of normal size gritting her teeth in anger she punches the wall, destroying it, allowing her to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NONONONONO!!!!\" She heard a woman scream, readying her axe she continued forward, until she came across Cia, her tan body at just a bit smaller than Rosalina's, Cia was on her knees pounding at a computer destroying it, then pounding the wall letting out screams of pure and utter rage, \"WHY! WHY AM I NOT BACK TO NORMAL!!\" Her body grew as she heated up more, Rosalina looked at an empty bottle on the table next to the raging Cia, \"ME WANT NORMAL!!! ME NOT WANT STRONG!\" It appears that her mind was devolving while her size grew, \"BUT CIA STRONG!! WHY CIA STRONG!!! AAAHHH\" Cia grabbed her head and foam began coming from her mouth, when her growing stopped Cia was at least thrice the size of Rosalina with none of her intelligence, \"CIA BREAK!!! CIA DESTROY!!!\" Cia continued to break everything in her way until she heard the crunch of glass underneath Rosalina's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CIA KILL!!!\" Cia screamed jumping towards Rosalina who managed to roll away, running down the hallway. She ran with the behemoth formerly known as Cia following her, managing to slide through a large doorway, Rosalina got up, trying to think of a way out of this but she then realized she was not alone, looking over she saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her muscles also caused a lot of stress on her clothing, threatening to rip out at any moment, and her ass, her ass was global, it was popping at the seams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosalina? What's going on, is Cia alright?\" A scream from outside of the room answered her question, Lucina let out a sigh, \"I tried to warn her not to try and reverse the changes, I really did.\" Lucina peeked her head out the door, catching a glimpse of the behemoth outside, \"Damn, she's huge!\" Lucina then looked at Rosalina, \"How strong are you right now?\" Rosalina then went over to one of the metal lockers in the room, and ripped the door off with ease, then with just as much ease also ripped out a sink, \"We're gonna need more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot,\" Lucina sighed going over to another locker and ripping off the door she held a batch of pills, Rosalina recognized them as the ones Widowmaker had. Opening them Lucina popped two in her mouth, and almost instantly her eyes glazed over a bit and a hard blush streaked across her face. \"Grrraahhhh!\" Lucina grunted as her sleeves gave out shredding to pieces as Lucina's muscles grew, \"Mmmnaaah!\" She ripped off her shirt completely her breast bouncing as they we set free. Her abs strengthened, becoming harder. Her pants were torn to shreds as well, her thighs becoming to much for the poor fabric. She ripped the tiara from her hear grew, reaching her ballooning ass. She tried to stand to her new full height of 18 ft, but her head hit the ceiling. She screamed, \"DAMN YOU!!\" and tore the ceiling down making room for her head. But that wasn't enough, grabbing a table connected to the floor, she tore it off and chucked out the room before grabbing the door frame, and ripping a chunk of the wall away. Lucina panted her veins pulsing in rage, she smiled, \"DAMN!!, this feels so good!\" Ripping another chunk of the wall away, \"Where's the bottle I need more.\" Rosalina watched, a little afraid to move, as Lucina tore the room apart searching for the pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" She gulped down two more pills before regaining some of her sanity, \"Oh, oh nooooarrrrrgh!\" Her fists clinched as she grew taller, even while ducking, her back now scraped the ceiling, \"GRAAAAHH!!\" she screamed elbowing the ceiling. Her veins popped as you could hear the stretching of skin as her arms grew, foam coming from her mouth, she appeared as a wild animal, and right now, she was. \"AAAAAHAHHHH!!!!\" She tears the walls apart, moving from spot to spot faster and faster as her legs grew thicker and thicker. Her growth didn't stop until she was 28 ft, and in the moments just after it was over she was still an animal, she grabbed Rosalina, \"You need to try this!\" shoving 3 pills into her and taking the last for her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Lucina and Rosalina moaned, \"OoooAARRRGH!!\" Rosalina cried as her breast ripped out of her shirt, wobbling free for a few moments, her biceps ripped through the short sleeves, leaving nothing to cover her upper body. Her forearms matched her biceps in growth as her two-handed axe became one-handed due to her growth, when she two hit the ceiling she screamed in rage ripping anything apart that she could get her hands on using her axe as a tool. Her abs solidified becoming harder than diamond, her hair grew longer, now both eyes were nearly covered, her hair sneaking it's way between her global breasts, in back crawling down her growing ass and resting just at the knee. He Thighs thickened and his calves thickened, testing them she kicked a wall, completely destroying it. Rosalina lets a laugh escape her lips, \"HAHAHA!! AMaaaaaaazing!!!\" Stopping her growth a 30 ft. \"MMMMMAAAHAHHH!!\" again Lucina goes through the process, again she destroys all until she hits 33 ft, her hair now resting at knee length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the amazons step out to the hallway, eyeing their target. Lucina nodded at Rosalina, who immediately threw her axe at Cia, lodging it into her arm. Cia roared in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HURT CIA!! HURT YOU!!\" Cia charged towards them but she was too large to go through the hallway, and got stuck. Lucina and Rosalina charged her, one after the other, shoulders touching the walls. First Lucina kicked Cia square in the head, and jumped onto her back, which caused tears to form in Cia's eyes. Rosalina provided an onslaught of punches causing the tears to flow. Then Lucina, gripping Rosalina's axe, slammed it into Cia's skull. There was a pause for a moment before Cia let out a terrifying scream and evaporated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two amazons sat there, panting, before leaving the building, making a bigger hole from Rosalina's original hole. Laughing a bit the two then grip a hand from the other. Their veins popped as they struggled to outmatch the other. However slowly but surely Lucina was winning, eventually forcing Rosalina's hand down. Rosalina rubbed her wrist from the ordeal while Lucina laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try again in a few feet!\" She stopped when she saw a glistening object, glowing green. \"Is that?\" She wondered leaning down to pick up the object. But before she could Rosalina swiped it, chuckling a bit, \"Nah it's nnnrg!\" As Rosalina gripped the stone, her veins popped her biceps growing larger. \"Aarrrg\" Rosalina grunted before shooting up to 35 ft. Her teeth sharpened some, as her mouth formed. \"RRrrrrrrg Rrrrrrg\" Bigger and bigger her muscles grew, concerned Lucina backed up some before hightailing it away, not waiting to see the upcoming events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, that energy!\" Rosalina panted and looked at her new possession. Was this the power of these? The power of the hyper stones? She needed to find all seven right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around, Rosalina soon finds one of the re-spawn centers, going around back as she's to big to fit in there, she finds a clothing rack labeled 'Giantess'. Deciding her outfit this time round, she chooses black gym shorts, nice and stretchy kind, and a light blue tank top that cuts off before the abs with a crown decoration in the middle, both are guaranteed to last till 50 ft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also buys some leather arm-guards and a plated shoulder-pad as well as a metal helmet. She also got a bag, to keep the gems in and as she puts the gem in the bag, she feels the gem's energy leave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering around Rosalina comes across a small batch of giga mushrooms, of course taking one. A familiar rush runs through her as her body yet again grows, Rosalina moans as her breast swell, nearly popping out of her to, creating something similar to the appearance of a muffin. Her abs harden and her biceps grow, as her forearms grow, her arm-guard snap falling to the ground. Her thighs and calves thicken as her ass attempts to squeeze from the shorts' control. Now at a remarkable height of 52 ft, she smiles. Eyeing some contestants on the ground she stomps on them marveling at the destruction she can cause with just a few steps. Hearing a strange noise she moves out of the just in time for a blast to fly by, she remembers that blast as the one that vaporized her all that time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the culprit?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosalina eyed the blue woman who seemed surprised at the fact that Rosalina was able to dodge her blast. Towa gripped her staff, her muscles straining against her tight leather bodysuit allowing each and every detail to be seen. Towa clocked in at about 10'0\" being dwarfed by the woman in front of her, her muscles however, had ripped through her original suit, the one she wore now was something she constructed via her magic to maintain a degree of decency, she was no barbarian after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears you're faster than before!\" Towa exclaimed, careful not to let the worry in her voice be known. Rosalina smiled and reached into her bag, in which she could only fit 2 fingers, and gripped her gem allowing it's energy to flow through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that was fast,\" The energy caused Rosalina's muscles to bulge, \"Try this!\" Before Towa could react she was swatted from the sky, landing hard on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grah!\" Towa visibly bounced of the ground causing her to cough out some blood. \"Damn! I shouldn't of taken her on while she was uninjured!\" You see the reason why Towa had so easily vaporized her last time was the fact that because of her extremely rapid growth and the injuries she had already sustained had weakened her severely. Towa attempted to fly off but was grabbed by the giant. Raised to meet Rosalina eyes she saw that Rosalina wore quite a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go you giant ruffinan!\" Towa screamed at Rosalina, embarrassed by the fact that she could hold her with such ease. This caused Rosalina to squish her a bit, causing Towa some pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tongue!\" Rosalina barked, her stern gaze remaining on Towa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean ma'am!\" Towa begged, not wishing to risk any of her power, as not even it now stood a chance against the giant in front of her. \"Hey how about you don't crush me! I could, I could fit in the smaller places for you so you won't have to worry about being too big!\" Rosalina laughed at this before setting Towa down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could just rip apart these 'smaller places' so I wouldn't even have to go inside them, and plus, how could I know you wouldn't take the power for yourself?\" Rosalina flexed her arms, causing her top to finally rip, exposing her large breasts. \"Oh, oops,\" Rosalina smirked, betraying her long gone sense of decency. \"Do you not find these amazing!\" Rosalina cupped her breasts, taking a seat so she'd be somewhat at Towa's level. \"I don't believe I can keep the poor girls contained any longer!\" Towa just stared up in wonder, how was she so lax? \"Pass me that giga mushroom over there, these shorts are rather bothersome.\" Towa did as she commanded, hoping to prove her loyalty so the giantess wouldn't crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina popped it in her mouth like a pill, before moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaa!\" her biceps bulged, and Rosalina ripped off her shoulder pad. Her breasts wobbled like jello as they grew, and her ass made a print in the ground as it ripped free of the shorts. Her hair grew longer, blanketing nearly her entire backside and shoulders, she brushed the hair off her face to retain the ability to see. The only thing on her backside her hair didn't cover, were the sides of her ass and her heels. The growing stopped and Rosalina stood up to admire herself, standing at a remarkable 71'0\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Towa looked up at the woman now 7x her own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fucking know right!\" Rosalina smacked her lips, \"It's such an amazing rush!\" Towa knew the feeling of growing, it was amazing, though in the after effects she felt more aggressive and ready to pound away with her fists, as opposed to thinking things out. Which is why Towa knew that she had to keep Rosalina calm, no matter how kind she seemed now or how kind she was then. She knew the slightest misstep would cause Rosalina to crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" Towa bowed slightly, small beads of sweat on her forehead, \"It is quite a wonderful feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm,\" Rosalina smiled sitting back down, \"It is indeed!\" She eyed Towa a bit before licking her lips. \"How strong are you Towa?\" Towa smirked at that and prepared to blast away a large tree before Rosalina stopped her. \"Y'know what I meant.\" Towa was slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowa went over to the tree that was at least twice her size and grabbed it. She pulled, attempting to rip the tree out of the ground. Her muscles tensed as she continued to rip and pull the tree. Her suit began to tear not being able to handle the stress of her working muscles. \"Aaaarggg!\" She screamed as she ripped the tree from the ground, \"AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!\" Her ki flared, her arms ripping out of the suit sleeves. She held the tree above her head and chucked it as far as she could, it flying in the air for some time. Panting Towa looked at her massive biceps, a blush forming on her face. Mira was always the strong one, and right now she felt as though she was the strong one instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a show! Look your arms burst free!\" Rosalina laughed from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT-UP!!\" Towa screamed bringing a fist to the ground. Anger boiling, she grabbed another tree and ripped it off the ground as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Rosalina giggled, \"There's the anger!\" Towa shook her head, she had let her anger take over for a moment. She glanced at the tree still in her arms and dropped it, causing a loud thud. Rosalina stood back up, preparing to walk away. \"Alrighty, I'll let you off the hook this time Towa, hope your strong enough for us to properly fight next time!\" Rosalina preformed a right hook in the air, before walking off, leaving Towa by herself, clenching her fists.</span></div></div>",

I hope that the Pokemon don't mind if I just take a quick nibble at one or two rare candies...\" Bianca said, opening up a Rare Candy to try to eat.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">RULES:<br>\r\n1. You must start out as one of the 25 starting characters.<br>\r\n2. Characters can't die. They'l simply respawn at one of the island's respawn centers.<br>\r\n3. Non-humanoid characters can't grow.<br>\r\n4. No herms, vore, or scat.<br>\r\n5. Only characters that debuted in a video game are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nITEMS:<br>\r\n-The seven magic items that the contestants need to acquire are called Hyper Emeralds, a variant of the Chaos Emeralds. There are many copies of each gem hidden across the island. It's rumored that holding a single gem fills one with boundless energy...<br>\r\n-The Assist Trophy is different from the one in Super Smash Bros. It can summon anyone from the user's home series, and the user gets to decide who.<br>\r\n-Anyone summoned by the Assist Trophy is allowed to grow, unless they clash with Rule 3.<br>\r\n-The Giga Mushroom is an item bred from Super Mushrooms imported directly from the Mushroom Kingdom. Your height won't be the only thing changing...<br>\r\n-The Rare Candies produced by the scientists at the research lab are way different from their Pokemon counterparts. They haven't been fully tested yet, so there may be different results between users.<br>\r\n-The Triforce of Power is usually wielded by the thief king Ganondorf, but the one in the Shrine of Din hasn't been touched by evil... yet. Its full capabilities are unknown.<br>\r\n-Mighty Berries are an experimental plant being developed by the scientists at the lab. There are bushes scattered around the island.<br>\r\n-Any other items are allowed, but preferably stuff that causes growth.<br>\r\n-Weapons such as guns and swords are nerfed for fairness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE ISLAND (will be updated whenever a new area is added to the story):<br>\r\n-Delfino Dock, the only dock on the island. It's on the southern side of the island.<br>\r\n-Diamond Beach, a beautiful stretch of sand near the dock where the adventure begins. The beach has a few neglected shacks scattered about, a shipwrecked boat that the owner of the island is too lazy to remove, and a few bushes of some unknown plant species.<br>\r\n-Mount Sanguine, a rather small mountain near the eastern coast (it only takes a couple hours to reach the top). The peak appears to have been blasted away, leaving a crater large enough to have several buildings.<br>\r\n-Mount Sanguine Research Center, a lab at the top of the mountain where various experiments are performed. This is where many of the items are made.<br>\r\n-Flame Peak, an active volcano on the northern coast. Supposedly magic is used to ensure it doesn't damage anything.<br>\r\n-Close to Flame Peak is an unnamed hot springs spa, run by a man named Jonathan. A great place to relax between fights.<br>\r\n-Shrine of Din, a small temple seemingly built for the goddess of power that's near the northern coast. Whoever this shrine truly is for, their light shines upon the altar.<br>\r\n-Lost Woods, a heavily forested area near the middle of the island. Despite the name, it's rather hard to truly get lost.<br>\r\n-Kolas Jungle, a hot and muggy jungle covering part of the west coast. How is there even a jungle here? SCIENCE!<br>\r\n-Scattered around the island are multiple caves. Maybe there's something hidden within them?<br>\r\n-There are multiple roads and trails connecting the various areas. Scattered along them are huts and cabins where contestants may rest.<br>\r\n-Z's Fortress, located at the very center of the island. Is this the final dungeon, or will there be more adventures to be had?</td>",
