It really works!\u201c, reassured Ethan his friend Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eYeah, right. As if there was a thing as swapping people. And to think that it would be made possible through a tablet like thing that just happened to land in your backyard at night\u201c, Lilly replied and shook her head. \u201cHow stupid do you think I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m telling you it really worked! And when I found it, it wasn\u2019t a remote. It was a strange liquid like thing and the moment I touched it, it changed into this remote\u201d, he explained again and showed her the remote. It was black in colour and was made almost completely out of a touch screen. \u201cI guess it changed to this form to make using it easier for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiiiiight\u201d, said Lilly, still not believing him. Ethan knew that this thing would work. He had already tested it. The swapplet, like he had decided to call it, was too big to carry it around town and not having someone see it. Sure, he could have grabbed a backpack and had it hidden in there but that would be too easy. He had swapped his mothers purses with his lack of having a purse and was now carrying around a stylish, black leather purse. The best part was that nobody seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary, his mother did not even bat an eye that he was now carrying around her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, if you don\u2019t believe me, then how about I show you? How about we swap hair?\u201d, he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed long and loud. \u201cOkay, fine. Embarrass yourself.\u201d She crossed her arms and looked at him, waiting for him to finally tell her that he was just messing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan began typing on the swapplet and then handed it over to her. \u201cHere, you have to let it scan your hand first. Otherwise you won\u2019t see the swaps\u201d, he explained. Ethan was not sure why he knew that. He figured that the swapplet somehow communicated directly with his mind and explained to him how it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly rolled her eyes but did as she had been told. Ethan then resumed adjusting the settings on the swapplet so that he would swap Lilly\u2019s red, curly, shoulder length hair with his short, blond hair. As soon as he pressed \u201cAccept\u201d he could feel his hair lengthen. It happened so fast that the swap was almost instantaneous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOD!\u201d, exclaimed Lilly as she immediately grabbed her now short hair and looked in disbelieve at her friend. \u201cYou were really telling the truth!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTold ya\u201d, he said with a big grin on his face as he ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cAnd like I said, if you did not scan your hand and register yourself on the swapplet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwapplet?\u201d, she interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it didn\u2019t have a name written down somewhere and \u2018alien thing that landed in my backyard that allows me to swap everything between two people\u2019 doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue. Anyways, as I was saying before you rudely interrupted me: If you are registered within the applet, you will notice every swap that will be made afterwards unless it is specifically adjusted to exclude you\u201d, he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it can swap everything? So, let\u2019s say I would like to swap my outfit\u2026\u201d, she pointed her finger at her yellow T-shirt, tight jeans and wedge heel sandals. \u201cwith yours\u2026\u201d, she then pointed at Ethan\u2019s black T-Shirt, brown pants and black sneakers. \u201cor if I wanted to swap my purse with yours, I really like it by the way, it would be possible, and nobody would think this was strange?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan chuckled slightly at her comment about the purse. It proved that reality changing really worked but he could not tell that to Lilly. She would not believe him anyway. It was also kind of exciting for Ethan to carry around such a feminine item without anyone taking a second glance at him. He had been interested in stories where the protagonist gets swapped with the opposite gender for quite some time now. He had always wished that something like this was possible and would happen to him, not that he would tell that to anyone. But now it was possible, and it was happening to him! And it was exciting and turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, it works exactly like that\u201d, he answered as he casually played with his new hair. \u201cIt can swap every aspect of your body, every item that belongs to you. It can even swap traits of your personality, skills or how people see you and stuff. If I wanted I could swap lives with you. We would still look like our normal selves, but everybody would think we were the other person. And before you asked, no I haven\u2019t tried out anything other than our hair swap. As scary as it sounds, the swapplet seems to communicate with me telepathically and lets me know its capabilities and how it works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelievable\u2026\u201d, she muttered. \u201cCan\u2026 Can I have it for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan hesitated for a moment. Something in him told him not to let go of the swapplet but a short glance at Lilly, a girl he knew since kindergarten, a girl who he called his best friend and most important of all a girl he had a crush on for as long as he can remember, his doubts vanished, and he handed her the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilly took hold of it her eyes suddenly became empty for a moment. Then suddenly the life returned to her eyes. \u201cI understand what you mean. I suddenly know how to use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScary, isn't it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \u201cBut it is handy. Now I know how to use the device.\u201d She looked it over for a brief period. \u201cEthan\u2026 Do you know what this means? Just think of all the possible things we could do! We can be anyone we want! We don\u2019t like something about ourselves? Then we just swap it away! This is so exciting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and that is exactly the reason why nobody except us should know about it. We can\u2019t risk losing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 So, what now? I want to try it out, but you found it, so it\u2019s your decision what we do with it now\u201d, she said and handed it back to Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I would say we should not go around and mindlessly swap us or others for fun. At least not for now. We don\u2019t know if anyone noticed the swapplet landing in my backyard apart from me. We should try to make only a few swaps and keep it hidden until we are absolutely sure that nobody but us knows about it\u201d, he explained to her. \u201cBut, I get that you want to try it out. One swap, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her the swapplet back and she took it with glee. \u201cOkay, okay. Let me think. What should I swap? The possibilities are endless!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just to\u2026 you know\u2026 find out how it feels\u2026\u201d, she stuttered with a bright, red face. \u201cAnd we can swap back tomorrow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gulped. The thought of having his crushes vagina in his pants was an arousing one. \u201cAlthough I would very much prefer it to have it in her pants while doing some other stuff\u2026\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm\u2026 Okay. Here, take it. You know how it works\u201d, he said and handed the swapplet back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took it and began adjusting all the options. When she was finished Ethan felt a strange sucking feeling between his legs and with the blink of an eye he had Lilly\u2019s vagina between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I er\u2026 swapped the whole apparatus around these things as well\u2026 You know, reproductive system and stuff like that\u2026 I was afraid of what might happen if we mix that\u201d, she said, her face still bright red. Ethan noticed the bulge in her tight jeans that was getting bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 that is okay\u2026\u201d, he mumbled and took the swapplet back from her. This whole situation just got more disturbing and more arousing. \u201cI think it would be the best if I go now. I er\u2026 see you tomorrow before class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan put the swapplet in his purse and left Lilly's room and house. On the way out, he took note of how different his crotch felt now and as he stepped outside he noticed something else: The two forgot to swap back hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we will swap that back tomorrow as well\u2026\u201d, he thought as he slowly walked back Home, feeling the wind blowing through his sexy, red hair. He had to admit, he was liking what just happened to him. He enjoyed having this long hair that even had the faint smell of Lilly's strawberry shampoo. He enjoyed having a vagina between his legs, especially Lilly's. And he liked having a purse to carry around his stuff. He might keep it forever. \u201cIt's not like mom will miss her purses\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan lived not too der away and soon arrived back home. His father\u2019s car was not in the driveway, which meant that dinner would not be ready yet. \u201cI\u2019ve been back sooner than I thought.\u201d He entered the house and immediately noticed the smell of his mothers cooking. Dinner may not have been ready, but his mother was already working on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d, said Ethan and went upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo soon? Is everything alright? You were in such a hurry to see Lilly that I figured I\u2019d have to phone you to come to dinner\u201d, came his mothers voice from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan stopped in his tracks on the stairway and bowed down, so he could see into the kitchen. His mother was 43 years old and worked as a teacher at a local junior high. She had long blond hair and was currently wearing a black tank-top, a flowery skirt and black pumps. She had a heart shaped apron above her attire. She was in great shape for her age, people normally guessed she was in her mid-to-late 30s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s alright\u201d, he told her. \u201cLilly just had something else to do. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m upstairs till dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his mother could reply, Ethan stormed up the rest of the stairs, past his younger sisters locked door and into his own room. He locked the door behind him and his heart began racing. Dropping the leather purse next to his opened closet, he noticed for the first time that he now possessed all of his mother\u2019s purses. He knew that of course already, the swapplet had told him, but it was something else to see it with his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew mom had different purses for different occasions\u2026 But so many?\u201d, he thought but then shrugged his shoulders and plopped down on his bed. They were his now, so whatever. He was more interested in trying out what was in his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped off his pants and boxer shorts and revealed a smooth vagina. \u201cLilly\u2019s vagina\u2026\u201d, he mumbled in awe. This was the nearest he had gotten to it. Well, apart from this one time in elementary school where he tripped during a swimming lesson and fell against Lilly. To be more precise: His face landed against Lilly\u2019s swimsuit clad crotch area. But they were children back then, so that does not count!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shaky hands he touched his new plaything and immediately felt aroused. He probed it with his fingers, feeling the lips of his new equipment, probing a small spot on the upper side of it that was giving him a very pleasurable feeling. All the playing began to dampen his vagina and curious as he was, he put a finger inside it. A gasp, a moan, escaped his mouth. He continued exploring his new playground while trying to suppress his moans. It was unlikely that his mother was hearing him downstairs but better safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost screamed as he reached a climax. Ethan breathed heavily and relaxed his whole body. He could really get used to this experience. He laid down on his back and looked up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInfinite possibilities\u2026 Lilly has a point there\u2026 Just to think of all the things I can experience now. Everything I have dreamt of and more\u201d, he said quietly to himself. \u201cI always wanted to know what it is to have female body parts or wearing female clothing. Now I can and without anyone thinking it is strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up again and his now long hair fell in front of his face. He smiled thinking that it originally belonged to Lilly. \u201cAnd Lilly seemed to have been really excited about this as well\u2026 Maybe I can swap myself with someone who has more courage than myself. Someone who would be able to ask her out on a date\u2026 Or at least tell her about my feelings. This is our last year in high school, dammit. If I don\u2019t tell her now, she will be off to college or something. Come to think of it, she never mentioned what she wanted to do after school. Not that I was really thinking about this myself. Well, almost a whole school year ahead of me to worry about that\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he heard a knock on his door. \u201cEthan? Mom is calling us for dinner\u201d, he heard the voice of his sister Stacy say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was two years younger than Ethan and had the same blond hair as their mother. She was skinny, nerdy looking with glasses on her face. She was into anime and cosplay and usually spent her free time in her room watching anime, sewing costumes or being on conventions in said costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, coming!\u201d, he replied. So, Stacy was home all along. Hopefully she did not hear him. Sure, the walls between their two rooms were not thick but Ethan had tried his best to stay quiet. He then slowly got up of his bed and began putting on his boxers and pants. \u201cMaybe we should have swapped underpants as well. I doubt Lilly now has enough room in her panties\u201d, he thought and looked over to his purse where the swapplet was still hidden in. He pondered about whether he should use it again. Nobody would notice any swap he makes, and it was in his house so no danger of anyone seeing the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the swapplet out of his purse and went to the stairs. He carefully looked down the stairs into the kitchen where he saw his mother finishing dinner, his sister helping her set the table while his dad was sitting at said table and read a newspaper. He was a 47-year-old with gray hair, was currently wearing a suit. Ethan knew that he was working in some big company as head of accounting or something like that. He never really was interested in what his dad actually did for a living apart from \u201cworks at a big company\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 What to do now?\u201d, he wondered and looked at the swapplet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201eWell, I guess this will be interesting. But I doubt I will keep it like this for longer than the dinner\u201d, he thought as he began choosing the right options on the swapplet. Ethan had already swapped clothing and physical attributes, but he had not tried out swapping something less physical. The scary psychic connection with the swapplet had told him that he would have a hard time figuring out a personality trait swap on his own. At least when he swapped a trait with himself. And he wanted to do a swap with himself for now, this whole ordeal arousing him too much. So, he decided to swap his family position with his dad. His mom should be acting different around him, when she thought of him as her husband, as well as his sister who would think of him as her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I really don\u2019t want this swap to last\u2026\u201d, he shuddered at the thought that his mother would be very affectionate with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan accepted the swap and immediately noticed something different about him. He was wearing a wedding band. Not any wedding band, it was his fathers. He quickly walked back to his room, only finding out that it had changed. All his stuff was gone and replaced with his dad\u2019s stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense, he is the son now, so he would live in my room. Which means that I am now sharing a room with mom\u201d, he thought and checked his hypothesis. Of course, Ethan was right and found his clothes and everything else in his parent\u2019s room. He hid the swapplet again in his purse, he did not want anyone of his family to see it and ask questions, and then made his way downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally, you come down, darling\u201d, Ethan\u2019s former mother said as he entered the kitchen. It was so strange for Ethan to hear his mother call him \u2018darling\u2019 but that was the name she used for her husband, which he now was. He also noticed that his \u2018son\u2019 was now sitting at Ethan\u2019s spot on the table which meant that he had to sit down on his \u2018sons\u2019 former chair, opposite of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery confusing to think about all this\u201d, he thought as he made his way to his place at the table. Before he could reach it, his \u2018wife\u2019 got in his way and kissed him on the lips. A ritual his parents did all the time before dinner, so he had to do it now. Ethan had kissed his mother before when he was younger but never had he kissed her on the lips and the way she was kissing him now was different. He could feel her affection through the kiss. He felt really uncomfortable. It was not that his mother, maybe he should call her his wife for the time being, was an unattractive woman. Sure, she wasn\u2019t the youngest anymore, but she did stay in shape. Some kids in school even consider her a milf, although that seemed to die down more and more over the years. But still, it was his mother he was kissing right now, no matter what she and everyone else thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two broke the kiss and looked into each other eyes briefly, Ethan noticing that his wife was looking at him as the man she fell in love with, Ethan took his seat as quickly as possible without coming of as strange. The actual dinner was not very different from all the other dinners, except that his wife was not as interested in his day as usual. Instead she was more interested in her daughters and her husband-turned-sons day. Ethan knew that she normally used dinner time to get to know her children more who afterwards would go back to their rooms and not talk with her for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis really helps me out now, because that way I can observe these changes more quietly\u201d, he thought as he ate his dinner. As far as he could gather from the conversation that was unfolding before him, everything was the same. His former father was still working at the same company, in the same position. The only thing that changed was that he was now the son of the family. Ethan was not sure how that worked, there was no swapplet knowledge of how all the potential swaps would affect reality except that everybody would think that everything was normal. Ethan was really interested in how they would justify that Ethan\u2019s son was older. Come to think of it, how could he even have children with his wife, when both had vaginas and uteruses? Adoption? Ethan really wanted to know but it was kind of hard to bring that up naturally in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the family had finished their meal, the two children left for their rooms, leaving Ethan and his wife to do the dishes. Ethan first thought about leaving his wife alone with it and swap back now, making her his mother again. But she could use the help and Ethan was curious just how she would react right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then...\u201d, Ethan said as he stepped beside his mom, getting ready to dry up the dishes she washed. \u201cLet's get this over with, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife smiled at him. \u201cBut of course, handsome. After that we can have some fun together\u201d, she winked and handed him a wet plate. Ethan took it and began drying it off. He tried to stay as cool as possible. He knew that it was only natural that his wife would be flirting with him, but it was still so unreal when he considered that his wife was actually his mother. Not knowing the extend of the reality changes however, the swapplet had very minimal information to share about that, he decided to play along. \u201cAs much as the thought of my parents having sex disgusts me, I don\u2019t want my dad to suffer just because I did something while I had his family position\u201d, he thought. It might be that nothing he did now had any consequences when he swapped back but he was not sure, and it was something to find out another day. \u201cAlthough I must admit, I\u2019m happy for them that they seem to still be so sexually active.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait\u201d, Ethan tried to grin his flirtiest grin he was able to in this situation. \u201cHow about we delay the dishes for later and have some fun now?\u201d. Ethan moved closer to her and put an arm around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see there is someone frisky\u201d, she grinned at him, but her face soon became serious again. \u201cBut no, you know how this normally ends. We have way too much fun and don\u2019t have the strength to continue here. So, work first, fun later\u201d. She turned her head back to the dishes and wanted to continue but stopped. She turned back to him and one of her hands moved to Ethan\u2019s crotch area and began caressing it. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, my love. You\u2019ll not regret it\u201d, she cooed and then turned her attention back to the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was dumbstruck. Had his mother just really touched his vagina? The thing that shocked him the most however was that he had enjoyed it. \u201cDid I just enjoy this because someone touched it or is it because of the swap I enjoy it when my wife touches me?\u201d, he thought as he continued drying up the dishes. The two would continue to exchange sweet words and touches, which mostly came from her than Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, playtime, right?\u201d, grinned Ethan as the last plate was dry. Over time he began enjoying the attention he was getting, and the flirting came more natural to him than he would have guessed. He was always too afraid to talk to girls and only talked to Lilly in a platonic way, although he had always wished there would be more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u201d, his wife said as she slung her arms around his neck and looked into his eyes. \u201cHow about you go upstairs right now, and I\u2019ll follow you soon?\u201d, she cooed and let go of him. Ethan grinned at her and made his way upstairs to their shared bedroom. As intriguing as this whole thing was, he still knew that his wife was really his mother and he certainly did not want to do something like that with her. So, he got the swapplet out of his purse that had been transported to his new room and used the reset option to reset the last swap. A \u201cflaw\u201d of the swapplet, if you could even call it that, was that you could only swap with someone if he was in sight, fortunately, the reset option was the only one not included in this rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore pressing on accept Ethan paused. Sure, he had no interest in having sex with his mother, but he wanted to try something out. He knew that it would work, he knew how the swapplet worked, but it was one thing to know it works and something completely different to see it working. Ethan waited in his shared bedroom for his wife. Only a few minutes later she entered the room with a lustful expression on her face. She slowly walked over to him and whispered in his ear: \u201cJust let me slip into something more fitting\u201d. She then walked over to the bathroom that was connected to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan exhaled. He had hidden the swapplet beside him, just in case his wife wanted to get down to business immediately and not get dressed first. In that case he would have pressed accept immediately. Fortunately, it went as he thought it would. Now he just had to wait for the moment. He began preparing the adjustments needed for his next move. It had to be fast, he did not want his wife to see the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom door opened and there she stood in a see-through red teddy. Ethan could see small wrinkles over her skin, something you would expect for someone her age, but he had to admit she did look much younger than other women. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d, she asked smiling seductively and slowly walking towards him. Ethan quickly pressed the necessary buttons, surprised that he could navigate the menus blindly. With the blink of an eye, he suddenly found himself wearing the teddy. Quickly he changed the settings to reverse the family position swap and suddenly found himself back in his room, sitting on his bed, the swapplet thankfully beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really does follow the user around\u201d, he thought. He had already known that of course. Just like he had known that he can reset swaps in any order he wanted, which was confirmed by him still wearing the red teddy. He also still had his sexy, red hair, his purses and his vagina. Just the wedding band was gone, and he had gotten his room back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis thing is really exciting\u201d, he grinned as he began looking at his current outfit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The alarm clock woke Ethan early in the morning. He was still dressed in the red teddy although it had gotten stained around his crotch after all the excessive playtime he had. He could not remember going to bed but he figured that he probably just passed out after a climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to get dressed, I guess. Have to meet Lilly before school\u201d, he thought and walked over to is wardrobe. As he looked into it, he remembered that he had swapped every article of clothing with his mother. Otherwise he would not have ended up in the red teddy because he had not worn equivalent clothing. \u201cAnd I probably would have destroyed it when I would have tried putting it on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan also remembered that he forgot to include Lilly in the reality adjustment which meant that she will notice that Ethan had all of his mothers clothing. \u201cIt will probably be too much for her and she will think I am weird. Better reverse that swap\u201d, he thought and grabbed the swapplet to restore his wardrobe to it\u2019s original state. \u201cAlthough I am going to miss this smooth material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the swapplet in a big, purple purse that he apparently used for his school books and supplies now that he had swapped all of his bags with his mothers\u2019 purses, Ethan wondered whether he should swap clothes with his mother again but let Lilly not know anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s tempting but no. At least not today\u201d, he thought and went to the bathroom he shared with his sister to start his morning routine, which had changed a bit. While he still showered like normally, he had to use different shampoo for his hair and had to take care of it differently than usual. Unfortunately, he had not swapped knowledge of stuff like this, so he just used the shampoo that smelled like his hair had smelled yesterday and decided to blow-dry it afterwards. Also, his vagina was something he had no idea how to take care of, so he decided to clean it as good as he could, remembering his session last night and almost starting a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole thing took him longer than usual but his sister, who usually went to the bathroom after him, seemed to be surprised that he got out so quick. \u201cYou usually take longer\u201d, she mumbled as she quickly slipped into the room. Ethan shrugged at her comment and made his way back to his room and got dressed in his clothes, again pondering whether he should swap back into his mother\u2019s clothes. Ultimately, he decided against it, grabbed his purse and went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother was of course already up and was preparing breakfast. Ethan grabbed a toast that was already ready and went to the door. \u201cSorry mom, have to be at school early, no breakfast for me\u201d, he said and left the house before she could reply anything. It was true that he wanted to be there as soon as possible, but he did not mean the school. He hurried over to Lilly\u2019s house. He also did not want to stay at his house any longer, the temptation to do the clothing swap was a bit too much for him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at Lilly's house just as she closed the door behind her. Today she wore a small leather jacket over a white tank-top, a black mini skirt and black and white sneakers. Ethan guessed she was wearing the skirt, so she had more room for her new-found dick, because it was definitely not hiding it well enough. \u201cIt seems someone is eager to go to school\", Ethan grinned at her. \u201cBy the way, I am not sure if you have noticed but we forgot to swap back our hair\", he added when he was close enough to her that nobody should be able to eavesdrop on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny\u201d, she replied and looked at him. \u201cI see you have decided that male wardrobe suits you better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you meant?\u201d, asked Ethan confused. How was it possible that she knew he had his mothers clothing up until this morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, there is this thing called facebook. And it has some pictures of us in it and, well, reality changes apparently mean changes for the present and the past. When I checked facebook after you went home, I could see you with long hair and without a bulge in your pants on every picture. Before going to bed, I checked facebook again and guess what? You were wearing women\u2019s clothing in every picture\u201d, Lilly explained to him. \u201cSo, why the change of heart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began walking away from Lilly\u2019s house and Ethan was scratching the back of his head. \u201cWell, you see\u2026 I made some swaps to test things, no I don\u2019t want to get more specific, and one of them involved swapping my mothers wardrobe. I just wanted to see if everything worked as it should be. Checking it out myself rather than blindly trusting the swapplet\u201d, he explained. He was lucky that he did not seem to have had any wedding or couple pictures on facebook or if he did, Lilly did not mention it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow and looked intensely at Ethan but then decided to not pursue this topic any longer. \u201cAnyways\u201d, she began. \u201cI have been thinking. You took the swapplet with you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did! I have it in my purse. It\u2019s way too dangerous to leave it lying around somewhere, even in my own room. Just imagine what might happen if my mom found it while cleaning\u201d, he said to her, making sure to keep his voice down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d, she smiled. \u201cSo, I am really curious about the non-physical swaps. The swaps of personality, life and so on. I would really like to try one out and I already thought about what it should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColour me intrigued\u201d, Ethan said. \u201cI presume you have thought about something at school, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought about this at first but let\u2019s be honest, the most interesting thing I could think of, at least where we would experience something exciting before school\u2019s end, was swapping with the teachers. I thought about \u2018ditching\u2019 school for today\u201d, she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do you have something particular in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head. \u201cNot really, no. I figured we would just go to school and swap with some random person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan began thinking about her proposition but decided against it. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d, Lilly asked him surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but we both don\u2019t know how the reality change exactly works. If you want to swap some personal info or even your whole life with some random person on the street, you won\u2019t know if you mess something up. Imagine you swap jobs with someone and then are so terrible at it that you get fired. We don\u2019t know if that person would also be fired after you swapped back. Therefore, I think it would be the best if we keep the number of unknown variables as low as possible\u201d, Ethan reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d, sighed Lilly. \u201cI still believe that you are just too afraid but I guess you are right. Then how about this? You definitely know our French teacher Ms. Dufour, I mean what boy at our school doesn\u2019t know that woman with the big breasts, perky ass and seemingly endless legs\u201d. Ethan could almost see the jealousy coming out of Lilly\u2019s mouth. She never was a girly girl, but she liked to dress feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I should probably know her. You just said it, she is our French teacher\u201d, Ethan answered sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took a deep breath and continued. \u201cAnyway, I thought maybe I should swap lives with her for the school day. I thought that maybe I should become a teacher after school and that is a great opportunity to see if I enjoy this. As for you, well, since you are too afraid to make any of these scary life, personality etc. swaps, I dare you to swap breasts with her for the school day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ethan had drunk something, he would have spit it out right now. \u201cI what?!\u201d, he exclaimed surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I mean, you already have my equipment down there, I let you keep it for the rest of the school day by the way\u201d, she said and turned slightly red. \u201cSo why not try the whole deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI er\u2026\u201d, he stuttered. Sure, he was interested in it. He had refrained from swapping breasts with his mother because that felt a bit weird but Ms. Dufours breasts? They would definitely not be weird, well weirder than being a guy with breasts. But he could not admit that to Lilly, could he? \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 Having your vagina for testing purposes is one thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a spoilsport. Apart from me, who will notice?\u201d, she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just for fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed. \u201cOkay, fine. I guess\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan was both excited and afraid of what will happen as the two friends arrived at school. It was still early, and most teachers and students had not arrived yet. Luckily for the two, Ms. Dufour was usually early at school and graded tests, prepared the following lessons and so on. Ethan always thought that she did it in the morning hours so she had more time having fun in the evening hours but that was just a guess. If asked she usually did not reply. Ethan could see through her classroom window that she was currently wearing a frilly, red blouse that emphasized her huge cleavage. He was no expert in the bra department but according to the other boys in school, she was a D-Cup. Her lower half was hidden beneath her desk, so he had no idea what she was wearing down below. He guessed she was wearing one of her usual tight knee-length skirts that emphasized her juicy butt and her pumps that made her legs even more stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pretended to talk while they observed her through the window. Luckily for the two, the only requirement for swaps was that you had to see the person you wanted to swap with. It did not matter if there was glass between you or if you saw them over CCTV. As long as the footage of the person you were seeing was live and had no delay, you could swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took the swapplet out of Ethans purse and he began to protest but went silent when he saw her puppy eyes. \u201cPlease, let me do the swaps\u201d, she pleaded, and he could not deny her request. She smiled broadly and began to adjust the swapplets options. \u201cOkay, first I will swap her breasts to you. It\u2019s easier to swap without her seeing the swapplet when we both are still in our normal lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan knew she was right, the swapplet had told him that the life swap would exchange a person\u2019s position as well as their life. They keep everything about their appearance, their body, their clothes, but gained everything else that belonged to the other persons life. It would be hard to use the swapplet when a swapped Ms. Dufour who thought that she was Lilly was standing beside him. Ethan also understood why she wanted to use the swapplet now: She did not want him to chicken out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan replied nothing and just waited for the inevitable. A surreal moment later, it felt like the time he had swapped his genitals, two big orbs had balooned out of his chest. But that was not all. He also felt something hold them up and that something was also digging into his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also swapped her bra\u201d, informed Lilly. \u201cYou will appreciate the support.\u201d She winked at him and then turned her attention back to the swapplet. Ethan on the other hand turned his attention to the foreign things on his chest. He had phantasized about these breasts since he first saw them two years ago. Ethan had always tried to hide his gazes from Lilly. He knew that she hated Ms. Dufour for her big breasts while Lilly herself was only something around a B-Cup. He only knew that because he had overheard a conversation with Lilly and Katie, her female, best friend. But now these big breasts belonged to him. He groped them, and it felt so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you on the other side\", interrupted Lilly his exploration as she finished the preparation for the swap. Ethan prepared for seeing Ms. Dufour in her full glory standing beside him but he suddenly was somewhere else. He was sitting on a chair behind a desk, various papers in front of him, a pencil in his hand. His gaze slowly wandered through the room. It was decorated with various posters that had french expressions written on them. He also saw the french flag on the wall opposite of him. \u201cOh no, she didn't!\u201d, muttered Ethan whose eyes moved to the window where he could see Ms. Dufour and Lilly. The latter seemed to be smiling broadly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he noticed that Ms. Dufour was dressed in the very same clothes he had been wearing mere moments ago. That drew his attention to the clothes he wore now, namely the same blouse that now was trying, together with the bra he had received, its best to restrain his also Nelly acquired breasts. His legs were now encased in a tight, red skirt that would definitely emphasize Ms. Dufours ass, which he thankfully had not received. His feet were clad in red 2-inch pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady in red, eh? Seriously why is she allowed to wear such clothes in school?!\u201d, thought Ethan who had never minded it until he was stuck wearing it. He looked back outside and saw that Lilly and Ms. Dufour were gone. Ethan began to panic. Lilly would not swap him into some random life, so she could have the swapplet for herself, would she? No, they were friends since kindergarten, they were best friends! He should not think of her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock in the door which was followed by a voice asking \u201cExcuse me? Ms. Dufour?\u201d thrusted him out of his thoughts but multiplied his panic. What should he say? But the information who the voice belonged to soon arrived his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in\", he said nervously. Would Lilly be alone? Would he have to face Ms. Dufour who thought she was him so soon? He sighed in relieve as he saw that Lilly was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, sorry that I deceived you. Don\u2019t worry about Ms. Dufour, or should I say Ethan? I told her I had to speak alone with you, she is waiting outside. I know that I told you I wanted to swap with her but as soon as we arrived here I started thinking. You never really seemed to have any interest in girls. You had no problem with keeping my hair and vagina. You even swapped clothes with some woman over night. So, I thought \u2018Why is that?\u2019 and came to the only possible solution\u201d, she explained to him as she took seat in one of the chairs in the front row of the classroom. \u201cYou are gay and a transgender. Although wouldn't it make you straight when you identify as a woman and are attracted to men? Whatever, I'll google it later. My point is: You are too afraid to admit it, so I helped you out. You're Wellcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d, exclaimed Ethan as she smiled at him. \u201cI am not gay! And I certainly don't want to be a woman, at least forever, I just get turned on by the thought of being one for a short period of time... And I said too much...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d, she said, and her smile faded, being replaced by a look of guilt. \u201cBut\u2026 I was so sure about that! You never showed that you were interested in any girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I am to afraid to tell that to the girl I like\u201d, he thought but again was too afraid to say it out loud. \u201cI\u2019m such a coward! L\u00e2che!\u201d Ethan blinked, confused for a moment. That was French and not only that, it was surprisingly easy for him to read the French on the papers in front of him. He was always the worst student in class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really sure that I am not right?\u201d, asked Lilly guilt ridden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed. \u201cYes, yes I am. Like I said, I like girls and I don\u2019t want to be a woman. At least not for the rest of my life\u201d, he said, although he whispered the last sentence more to himself than to her. It was probably in vain, but just in case the shock that her theory about him was wrong, made her overhear his comment about being turned on. \u201cWhat else did you swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly blinked confused by the sudden change of subject but recovered quickly. \u201cAs you might have already noticed, you swapped lives with Ms. Dufour, as well as her clothing. I am not sure if you have noticed but I also swapped your ability to speak French. Which basically means you should be fluent as a native speaker while she can barely introduce herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d, he interrupted her, obviously hurt by her comment. \u201cI am not that bad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep telling yourself that. Anyway, I haven\u2019t swapped your accents, meaning you still sound like you always do. Funny thing is, the swapplet seemed to understand your particular situation, or because your French skills are almost non-existent, either way you should sound like a French native speaker if you speak French. This of course leaves Ms. Dufour in a very strange situation, she can\u2019t speak French but has a French accent when speaking English. Gotta tell you, it was really funny hearing your typically speech patterns coming out of her mouth and with a French accent.\u201d, she continued explaining. \u201cApart from that, I also swapped your abilities to teach but that\u2019s it. Nothing else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded, taking in all these revelations. It certainly seemed as if Lilly had thought the whole thing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what now?\u201d, she asked him. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for putting you in this place. I can swap you back if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan thought about his situation, but he had to admit he felt turned on about this all. This was exactly what he wanted. \u201cYou know what? I think I\u2019ll stay this way until after school. BUT you have to swap with a male teacher of my choosing\u201d, he suggested. Ethan had only added the last part to mask his slip-up from before, still hoping she had overheard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine. Who have you thought about?\u201d, Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, he wanted to tell her that she should simply give him the swapplet and he would do the swap, but he remembered that the two swappers had to be in line of sight of each other. It was easier for Lilly to do the swap herself than going around the school with what everyone thought was Ms. Dufour until they found who he wanted her to swap with. \u201cMr. Anderson\u201d, he told her. Mr. Anderson was the coach of the football team and therefore of course the P.E. teacher. Word had it that Ms. Dufour and him might be in a relationship, which would certainly explain her clothing choices, but nobody knew the truth. As much as Ethan wanted to unravel this mystery, he would rather not have Mr. Anderson flirt with him in the teachers\u2019 lounge or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine. Then if you would excuse me, Ms. Dufour\u201d, said Lilly and got up and walked over to the door. \u201cI leave you to your work now. I have some things to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Evan was alone. He looked down at his big breasts in his red, blouse. \u201cThis is going to be an interesting day\u201d, he grinned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Ethan would have liked to play around with his new-found chest, he decided not to. Although it was still early, and most students and teachers would not be here for at least half an hour, that did not mean that the school was empty. The football team for example was training with Mr. Anderson on the football field for example. Mr. Anderson loved to have the football team exercise before school occasionally, which meant in his vocabulary almost all the time. The team was always pissed about it, but they dared not to speak up about it, because Mr. Anderson\u2019s training seems to work out. They were the top team. Unfortunately, the team let their frustration out on other subjects, such as Ethan. He had lost count of the times the team had bullied him out of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked down at his cleavage. \u201cI guess they won\u2019t try anything in that department for today\u201d, he thought. Still, he still did not know how the reality changes for the life swap were. For all he knew, everything he did today would have been done by Ms. Dufour when they swapped back. He did not want her to get in any trouble or something. So, he had to restrain himself and concentrated on the tests and papers in front of him. A quick glance back out the window got Ethan curious though. From Ms. Dufour\u2019s classroom one had a good look at the football field. One also had a very good look at Mr. Anderson who enjoyed joining his team in training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an ex-football pro in his mid-30s, a fact he liked to remind everyone about all the time, he was in very good shape. He could have played for one of the big teams if it had not been for his shoulder injury which prevents him from throwing balls but did not hinder him now running around with the team he coaches. This of course meant that many girls were crushing on him and word had that it was also the case for Ms. Dufour. From his seat in her classroom now, he could see it happen. \u201cIs that why she always is in so early?\u201d, thought Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to turn his attention back to the work he had in front of him, as he saw something interesting on the field. Mr. Anderson had stopped running and was looking at Ethan right now, the interesting thing was that it was Lilly with Ethan\u2019s short, blond hair, wearing the coaches attire. In her hand he could see that she was holding the swapplet. It had followed her after the swap, of course it did, but was currently in a bad spot. Lilly\u2019s new outfit had no big bags or pockets where she could hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan jumped out of his share and for the first time since the swap stood in Ms. Dufour\u2019s red pumps. He felt wobbly and every other boy in this situation would have had a hard time navigating in these shoes. Lilly did not swap the abilities to walk in high heels. Fortunately, Ethan\u2019s unique interests had him buy high heeled women shoes which he wore around the house when he was alone. \u201cThe trouble hiding them seems to have payed off\u201d, he thought as he walked out of the classroom. He could not walk as fast as Ms. Dufour could, he lacked the years of everyday practice, but at least he was able to get to the football field in a reasonable time without breaking his neck. Near the field he tried to look less coordinated in them to mask his unique interests from Lilly. He was still not sure if she had heard what he said but better safe than sorry, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly waited for him on the side of the field and was shouting some things at the team. She really sounded like Mr. Anderson when she did it. She turned around to him. \u201cAh, Ms. Dufour. I am glad you saw me through your window\u201d, Lilly said loud so that everyone around them could hear and it sounded like some bad actor saying his text. \u201cI found your tablet on the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at Lilly and then at the swapplet. \u201cOh, thank you\u201d, said Ethan almost as loud as Lilly and sounding almost as bad in terms of acting as Lilly. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t know what to do without it. Thank you so much.\u201d Ethan took the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries. I know how important this stuff is for preparing classes\u201d, Lilly replied. \u201cIf you would excuse me now, I have to get these kids in shape.\u201d Lilly turned her back to Ethan and began joining the team in training. Ethan on the other hand made his way back to \u201chis\u201d classroom where he would hide the swapplet in his purse. It would be safer to hide it somewhere near one of the two. \u201cBut if the team would not believe the rumors about Mr. Anderson and Ms. Dufour being an item, after this horrible performance they might as well be\u201d, thought Ethan as he opened the classroom door and put the swapplet in his purse. He noticed that it was not the purse he had chosen this morning. It was a small, brown purse that had barely enough room for the swapplet. \u201cLilly swapped all of my clothing with Ms. Dufour, so of course also the purses\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ethan still wanted to avoid getting Ms. Dufour in any kind of trouble he turned his attention soon back to the paperwork that was left for him to do. Luckily, most of it had already been done which meant that by the time Ethan was finished, he still had a few minutes before the bulk of the teacher and students should be arriving. He looked down to his cleavage, then back up again to the windows. It was not safe to do anything related to that in here now. Ethan of course forgot that the windows had blinds, but he came up with another solution. He got up, took his purse, just to make sure that the swapplet would stay with him, and walked down the hallway, his heels click-clacking with every step he took. Now that he was in no hurry to retrieve the swapplet or hide it, he could enjoy everything he felt. The slight bouncing of his breasts, the bra actually doing a pretty good job to minimize that, the feeling of cold air on his lower legs while the upper part was a bit constricted by the tight skirt. This was what he had always fantasized about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon arrived at the door of the teacher\u2019s lounge. Never had he been in there but as far as he knew there was a toilet just for the faculty members, which meant that it would be cleaner than the ones the students used. He slowly opened the door and carefully looked inside. He was lucky, nobody was there yet. Ethan closed the door behind him, took a quick glance around the room and soon found a door which looked like it leads to the bathroom and indeed it was. Just like he had thought the bathroom was cleaner, it was also smaller only containing one toilet, one sink and a mirror. He slowly walked up to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had changed but to see it first hand was something else. His face was framed by Lilly\u2019s red hair, while not styled in any way, since he had no idea how to do it this morning, it still looked feminine, and with the blouse and the cleavage he now possessed he could be mistaken as a woman if it were not for said masculine face. Taking a step back to get a fuller view of his current situation, he could see that apart from his obvious male figure, he could be mistaken for a woman. Technically he was, he had all the equipment a woman possessed, he was even able to produce children since he had also gained Lilly\u2019s uterus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo surreal\u2026\u201d, he mumbled and began groping the breasts that he now had, watching his reflection doing the same. Soon his groin began to dampen, a feeling he had already explored his fullest last night. Making sure that the door was locked, Ethan sat down on the toilet after hiking his skirt up and pulling down lacy, black panties he had been wearing, which were matching the bra he was now wearing as he found out when he began unbuttoning the blouse. Slowly he put a hand in one of his bra cups and got one of his breasts out of it. It felt so squishy and heavy. He did the same for the other one, not wanting to bother with getting the bra off and back on again. The two orbs were heavy on his chest, but the feeling was turning him on. Ethan began kneading both which resulted in even more arousal for him and soon one of his hand went down to his panties where he began fingering himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan escaped his lips. He pressed them together as hard as he could, nobody should hear what he was doing in here. He began becoming more aggressive as something was building up inside of him. Then suddenly he felt a great wave of pleasure running through his whole body that now shook involuntarily. Breathing heavy, Ethan had bent forward and now had his red hair in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis really feels much better with breasts\u2026\u201d, he mumbled. When he got his energy back, he put his breasts back in his cups and buttoned up his blouse. After flushing and washing his hands he exited the bathroom and was greeted by a now filled teacher\u2019s lounge. He had been in there longer than he had expected. Fortunately, nobody seemed to have noticed as everyone was busy talking and getting ready for the upcoming school day. Not wanting to engage in any conversation, Ethan walked, as quietly as his heels allowed him, out of the door into a hallway full of students and made his way back to what was now his classroom. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ethan arrived, he could see that some students were already there and had already taken seat in his classroom. His stomach began to turn, thinking that today he had to teach several classes. In French nonetheless! A language he barely understands. \u201cUnderstood would be the right tense\u201d, he thought as he began thinking in French just to see that it indeed did still work. His thoughts then began to shift to the upcoming lecture and just like everything related to the French language he knew exactly what Ms. Dufour had planned, what pages to read, etc. It felt so weird and while it took the fear for the upcoming day from him, there was still this lingering feeling of unease. Luckily, he had his lunch break after the next three periods. Hopefully he would be able to see Lilly to talk to her then, rather than watching her yelling at the students on the football field. It was still early in the school year, so it was warm enough to do P.E. outside, otherwise Ethan would have felt lonely without at least seeing someone who knew who he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze began to wander through the classroom. The students that were already there barely paid any attention to him and were talking among themselves. That got Ethan to think about the period after his lunch break. It would be the lecture where he and Lilly usually were, which meant he would now meet Ms. Dufour and Mr. Anderson who thought that they were Ethan and Lilly respectively. \u201cThat will be a strange class for sure\u201d, he thought, and a small grin appeared on his face as he thought about how the muscular Mr. Anderson would look in Lilly\u2019s skirt. He had not seen Mr. Anderson after Lilly swapped with him so baring he just happens to run across him during lunch break, he would not see him until class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, every student had taken seat and Ethan began his class. It felt natural although he could feel a bit of unease that on further inspection came with the inexperience of Ms. Dufour. She was sill young and did not have that much experience with teaching classes. While yes, she knew what she was doing, there was still this small lingering fear that she would do something wrong because of her inexperience. Now, after the swap, Ethan had those feelings, but he tried to dismiss them and got his classes over with eventually. Thankfully, nothing out of the ordinary happened, except for Kurt Jameson who was a year below and on the football team. He was a reserve player but still thought of him as high and mighty. This attitude, combined with the training Mr. Anderson got the team to endure, made Kurt a prime example of a bully. Kurt also seemingly felt untouchable this day or there was another reason that Ethan could not see. Nonetheless Kurt thought that it would be a good idea to stop listening to the lecture and play on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so good for Ethan to confiscate the phone from this guy. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m on the fucking football team!\u201d, exclaimed Kurt and jumped up from his seat. Ethan straightened himself up. Normally Ethan was an inch smaller than Kurt but with Ms. Dufour\u2019s heels he was taller, although only by around an inch. He raised an eyebrow and tried look show his authority. \u201cOh, I can, and I have, Mr. Jameson\u201d, said Ethan with a cold voice. \u201cAnd you can also think about what you did wrong in Detention today. You know that phones are against the rules during classroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan turned on his heels and went to his desk where he would put the phone down. \u201cYou can get if after school\u201d, Ethan added and then turned back to the class. \u201cOkay, where were we? Ah, yes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally\u2026\u201d, sighed Ethan as the last student went out of his room and he could finally get to lunch. He put the phone he had confiscated into his purse, grabbed it, got out of the classroom and locked the door. \u201cKurt will have to apologize to me after school, so he can get his phone back. This is gonna be totally awesome! But first something to eat and let\u2019s hope Lilly will be there\u201d, he thought while making his way through students who were changing classrooms to the teacher\u2019s lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the lounge he saw already some teachers sitting there and talking, drinking coffee and so on. Ethan made his way to the fridge, hoping that Ms. Dufour had something in it and was lucky that indeed there was. He found a sandwich with a post-it with her name on it in the fridge. \u201cNot very French\u2026\u201d, he thought but was glad. He was not very eager to try something new while he was in his school\u2019s teacher\u2019s lounge. He took it out, looked for a seat where he could eat alone and sat down. He looked around the room, so far, no Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, she has class right now\u2026 Or something else to do\u2026\u201d, he thought and took another bite from his sandwich. From the teaching experience he had received, he knew that he had some other stuff to do except for eating and as much as he did not want Ms. Dufour to get in trouble, he just did not care right now. The first three periods have been exhausting and he needed this break right now. Should she correct the homework he had collected after he had swapped back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was rather disappointed to find out that he either did not share a lunch break with Lilly or that she did not go to the teacher\u2019s lounge, either way, he sat there alone, even after finishing his sandwich. He had brought a lecture book with him, so he could look busy while waiting for his next period. He was not interested in talking to the other teachers, it is a shock for students to find out that teachers are normal people who had lives and stuff, but then talking with them on an equal level? No, he did not want to do that. The other teachers seemed to get his clue and decided to not talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his break was over, Ethan went back to his classroom and was getting mentally ready to come face to face with Ms. Dufour and Mr. Anderson. His heart skipped as he saw Ms. Dufour entering the classroom, wearing his clothes, having a flat chest. She looked so weird, almost nothing left of her attractiveness now that her chest was gone, and her juicy ass was hidden because of the baggy pants she was wearing. On the other hand, Ethan was almost bursting out in laughter as he saw the muscular Mr. Anderson in Lilly\u2019s white tank-top and leather jacket, that almost looked normal if not for the bigger hole in the front of his chest and that the jacket was obviously cut feminine. The black skirt made him look ridiculous. The two talked to each other while getting into their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey really think they are us\u201d, Ethan thought. \u201cLike with everything surrounding the swapplet it just looks so surreal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan straightened his face and began the lecture. He would often look at Mr. Anderson who although he was dressed like Lilly and thought he was in fact Lilly, would still sit just like he normally would. He would speak like Lilly, which was odd since neither Lilly nor Ethan have received speech patterns of the two they had swapped with, yet their two teachers talked exactly like them. \u201cProbably some quality of life thing or something? Or it has to do with the life swap and that they think they are us. Confusing and of course because it has something to do with reality adjustments, the swapplet has no idea\u201d, thought Ethan frustrated. \u201cAt least they fit in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his remaining two periods were uneventful and Ethan was thankful when it was finally over. His feet were aching from running around the class in his heels, his back was hurting, and he was exhausted. He fell into the chair at what was now his desk and breathed out heavily. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to swap back. As much as this whole situation was turning me on this morning, I just want to go back to my own life, to my own clothes\u2026 Okay, the body modifications can stay for another night\u201d, he muttered grinningly to himself and looked down at his cleavage. Ethan was unsure if he should go to the football field or the gym to meet Lilly or if she would come for him. He did not have to wait for too long as Lilly soon came through the door, wearing a track suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have thought about going to you but here you are\u201d, smiled Ethan at Lilly. \u201cAnyways, ready to swap back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? I thought you would like this\u201d, said Lilly. \u201cI enjoyed today. So much fun ordering students around, telling them to throw balls, run around. I can really see why Mr. Anderson seems to enjoy his job. But yeah, let\u2019s swap back. I\u2019m not really interested in football training later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan wanted to get the swapplet out of his purse but was interrupted by a knock on the opened classroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Miss\u2026\u201d, said Kurt, now sounding rather timid. \u201cI know that I should go to detention now, but you see, I have football training afterwards and\u2026\u201d. He stopped as he saw Lilly leaning at one of the student\u2019s desks. \u201cC-coach. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d Kurt turned his attention back to Ethan. \u201cI am really sorry for not paying attention in your class and would really appreciate it if I could get my phone back now. I don\u2019t want to be late for training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was surprised at first, he had forgotten all about Kurt. He had hoped that this would feel more awesome, but he was too exhausted and wanted him to go away as quickly as possible, so he could swap back. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t do it again. Next time, I won\u2019t be so nice. Now take your phone and go to detention\u201d, Ethan said, grabbed the phone that he had put into his purse as well and handed it to Kurt who took it and almost ran out of the room, probably because he was afraid of his coach seeing any more of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was brilliant. Kurt Jameson apologized to you!\u201d, exclaimed Lilly when Kurt was out of hearing range. \u201cThis totally made my day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan just sighed and grabbed into his purse again. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m too exhausted to care. Let\u2019s swap back.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The swap back was as disorientating as the swap into Ms. Dufour\u2019s life. \u201cCome to think of it, I have been living her life for half a day\u2026 And I still have no idea what her first name is\u201d, Ethan thought as he looked down at himself, glad being back in his clothes, although his shirt was not as flat as he remembered with his newly-acquired breasts still pushing out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked around and saw Lilly, seemingly back to normal except for the hair and the little tent that was her skirt. Both were just outside the school. \u201cSchool\u2019s out, so our doppelganger, if you can call them that, have been going home\u201d, guessed Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack to being me\u201d, said Lilly who had the same disoriented look on her face as Ethan. She then focused on him. \u201cSo, do you want to keep these things to have more fun with it today? Maybe want to borrow my clothes?\u201d, she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed heavily. \u201cSo you did hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did! Do you think I am deaf?!\u201d, said Lilly. \u201cBut this at least explains your behaviour. And so what? I\u2019ve known you for years and there are way more fetishes out there that I don\u2019t get and won\u2019t understand but that doesn\u2019t mean a person is bad or unlikeable for that. We can\u2019t decide what we like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan saw Lilly in a new light and loved her even more. She was acting so mature. \u201cThanks\u2026 Hearing you say that really means a lot to me\u2026\u201d, said Ethan and looked down at the ground, or at least tried to, his breasts getting in the way. \u201cStill\u2026 It embarrasses me, so, let\u2019s not talk about that, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wish\u2026\u201d, shrugged Lilly. \u201cLast thing though before I stop talking about this, keep the breasts and my vagina for tonight. I don\u2019t care, I had fun with your penis last night, too. Just don\u2019t damage them, me and Ms. Dufour will not forgive you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded and was at a loss of words. She really did take this whole thing more lightly than he would have expected. He thought she would have called him a pervert or something more horrible and would never have wanted to talk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u201d, she changed the subject. \u201cWhat will we do now? We experienced a life swap and I want to test it out even more. Let\u2019s do something fun with the swapplet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have something in mind?\u201d, Ethan asked. He did not necessarily want to use it again right now, the whole body aching stuff seemed to have been transferred in his body, so he was just as exhausted as he was before and wanted to get home and lay down. But because Lilly had just accepted him for who he is, how could he deny her that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026 No. I had hoped you had a great idea\u201d, she admitted. \u201cBut I guess you are kinda beat, too, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blinked. He had not thought about that Lilly might have had an exhausting day as well. She sure did not show it. Or was she just polite as she noticed how tired he looked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Maybe we should go to my place, hang around a bit and come up with something we can do with the swapplet\u201d, Ethan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood plan. I mean we still have almost a whole afternoon before us where we can use it, we can afford resting an hour or two\u201d, she said and the two began walking to Ethan\u2019s house. They began to exchange what their days as their teachers was like. Lilly telling him how she had made the football team run two extra rounds because they \u201clooked like a bunch of little girls skipping around\u201d. She knew it was unfair, but she wanted to test her power over the team. And they did without saying a word. They just did. Same thing in P.E. when she told them that they were playing soccer today. She knew that nobody in the class liked that sport and that was exactly why she wanted them to do it. Again, nobody objected, and everyone did as Mr. Anderson told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could really get used to that\u201d, she finished her story. \u201cAlthough the clothes are certainly not my style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at Ethan\u2019s house they saw no car in the driveway, which meant that neither of Ethan\u2019s parents were home yet. They would be alone except that his sister might already be there. It was a Wednesday after all and on week days his sister tends to rush home and lock herself up in her room to watch anime or sew on her latest costumes. So, basically, the two were alone right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan went straight to his bed as the two arrived in his room, he had dropped his purse at the door, and fell face front on it. \u201cSo soft\u2026\u201d, he sighed blissfully into his bedsheets. Meanwhile Lilly got the swapplet out of Ethan\u2019s purse and sat down on his chair. She looked at it from all angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks so unsuspicious. Just like a normal tablet but it can do so much. I really wonder who made this thing. How did it get here?\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy falling down from the sky into my backyard\u201d, replied Ethan, his face still buried in his bedsheets resulting in his voice being muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean before landing here. You don\u2019t seriously think such high-tech things or whatever this is fly around in the universe, just waiting to land in your backyard, do you? Somebody must have built it. Come to think of it. You said it was liquid and then it turned into this tablet?\u201d, asked Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d, responded Ethan and turned around on his back, because the feeling of his breasts being crushed under his body was becoming hurtful and it was becoming hard to breath with the face in his sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this is not his true form. But why isn\u2019t it changing when I touch it?\u201d, she said. \u201cAnd we know everything about how it works because it told us so, but we don\u2019t know where it came from or what its main function is. Is this a common device on an alien planet? An experimental weapon designed to infiltrate nations?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d, asked Ethan. \u201cI doubt it will tell us. Let\u2019s just take it for what it is: A tablet that allows us to swap everything we can think of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at Ethan for a while, then back to the swapplet, then back to Ethan, then sighed. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. It really doesn\u2019t help to think about it. Maybe some day we will get answers to these questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the swapplet on Ethan\u2019s desk and turned her attention completely to him. \u201cSo, as I just discovered you are not gay\u201d, she grinned at him. \u201cThere has to be girl you like, right? I mean everybody has someone who he is attracted to. Who is it? Is it Lisa? Taylor? That cheerleader bitch Tiffany?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly was referring to some of the best-looking girls in school. Ethan shook his head. \u201cNo\u201d, he said to her and would have loved to add \u201cit\u2019s you\u201d but even after the revelation of how accepting Lilly is, he was still too shy to tell her that he liked her. She had even thought that he was gay because he was such a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t want me to know?\u201d, she grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019ll find out soon enough. Maybe I should use the swapplet and swap our crushes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d, Ethan hissed at her which made her flinch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, he apologized. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 not comfortable with telling you that\u2026 It\u2019s someone you know and well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly needed a moment to gather herself and then looked at him. \u201cOkay, sorry, I get it. I can guess who it is, and I am sure she likes you, too. You two would make a cute couple\u201d, she said quietly. Ethan could have sworn that Lilly had a sad look on her face for a moment before it turned into her usual smile that he loved about her so much. \u201cProbably because I hissed at her\u2026\u201d, he thought, and he wanted to correct her, telling her that he loved her. But a small voice in the back of his mind was telling him that it would be better if she thought that he loved somebody else. He would ruin their friendship, she would love at him. He did not tell her anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. I have an idea\u201d, smiled Lilly. \u201cYou know, it kinda sucked when you went away with this sweet little thing. I almost couldn\u2019t sleep just because I wanted to use it some more. The same scenario will happen for me later today when I have to go home, and you keep the swapplet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so? What do you have in mind?\u201d, asked Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have two ideas. First, I could swap with your sister. No life swap, just a swap that makes me your sister and therefore I live here, but I am still me with all my interests, friends, age and so on\u201d, she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are almost the same age, yeah you are older but only by 5 months. It would not make sense for my mom to have given birth to you and then immediately after that birth to me\u201d, replied Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the reality adjustment will probably figure something out. Although, I guess you are right. I should in that case also swap ages with Stacy, just to avoid our heads exploding by trying to understand it. The other idea would be for us to swap with your parents\u201d, she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd let me guess, you would want me to be my mom\u201d, he said rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah. I mean you technically are a woman right now, biologically speaking. Also, as I learned today, you enjoy dressing up as a woman. And I think you look kinda cute dressed as a woman. Besides, the thing between my legs and my hair cut make me a better candidate to be your dad\u201d, she winked at him. \u201cAnd, well, I thought we could go out as your parents. Some nice restaurant or something. Just somewhere where we would normally not go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As enticing as the thought of going out in a dress was, his feet were still aching, and he wanted just to stay at home. The thought of Lilly being his sister and he therefore being in love with his sister made him shudder, but he guessed it was the lesser of two evils right now. \u201cAt least I know that she is not really my sister and we will swap back eventually\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess the sister swap would be the best\u201d, he said and looked at Lilly. \u201cHow about we do it right now? I\u2019m sure Stacy is already at home. But remember the age swapping. As you said it yourself, we don\u2019t want our heads to explode when we try to comprehend how the adjustment would work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded and smiled. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go\u201d, she said, jumped up from the chair and was out of the room before Ethan had even tried to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is really eager to use it\u201d, he thought and followed her. He found her waiting in front of Stacy\u2019s room, almost screaming to him to hurry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d, asked Ethan whispering. \u201cHow do you want to do it? Just open the door and to the swap as fast as possible? Talk to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled broadly. \u201cThe latter. Now you go in there, talk to her about something and let me check all the options and so on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed but did as he was told. He opened the door for his little sister\u2019s room. \u201cHey sis, I er wanted to talk to you about er\u2026 stuff\u201d, he said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy, who was currently wearing a pink tank top with some logo of an anime he did not recognize, grey sweatpants and pink socks. Her hair was tied back into a ponytail and on her face were glasses. She laid on her bed and was watching some anime on her laptop. As she looked up to whoever entered her room, her expression was not very happy. \u201cHave you never heard about knocking!?\u201d, she screeched. \u201cI could have been in underwear. I don\u2019t care if we have the same biological equipment! You are my brother and the thought of you seeing me naked is just gross!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026?\u201d, Ethan said surprised. There was some information, like that she knows that he has a vagina and breasts but still thought of him as a guy, that were new to him and he had to process. He also had no idea what he should be saying right now. Awkwardly he looked over to Lilly who was now standing beside him and was furiously hammering her fingers on the swapplet. She provided him no help right now and Ethan hoped that she would finish soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you know, sis... The thing that I wanted to talk with you about is...\u201d, he stammered, grasping for any straw of an idea he could come up with while hoping that Lilly would finish soon. Stacy was looking at Ethan as if he was the dumbest person on earth, but she waited politely for him to finish before she would continue screaming at him. \u201cI er... wanted to tell you... that... Er...\u201d, continued Ethan. \u201cI really...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world shifted mid sentence and suddenly instead of Stacy there was Lilly standing in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... love you\", Ethan finished his sentence before realising who stood before him. His face changed into a tomato instantly as he saw Lilly's face grinning at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, too, bro\", teased Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- I didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d, yelled Ethan, still red as a tomato. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what to say to distract her from you entering all the commands in the swapplet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head and smiled. \u201cI know, I know. But you do love your sister, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course. As a sister\u2026 Anyway, it seems to have worked\u201d, he said and looked around the room. The room itself was still the same one but the decoration looked more like Lilly\u2019s room than Stacy\u2019s. Gone were the anime posters, gone was her sewing machine. Instead there were posters of boy bands and in place of the sewing machine was simply a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, smiled Lilly. \u201cI\u2019m living here now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked around the room and then suddenly had a confused look on her face. \u201cEthan? Where is Stacy?\u201d, she asked. \u201cWe switched, so she should be your best friend and should be here, right? But she is not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\u201d, mumbled Ethan and the two went through the house but found nobody else. A quick look on Ethan\u2019s phone confirmed that Stacy still existed and was seemingly Ethan\u2019s friend. The strange thing was, that he did not have her on quick dial as he did for Lilly. Even stranger was that he had Lilly still on quick dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to Ethan\u2019s computer and began doing research through facebook and other social media platforms. They soon gathered that while Stacy was Ethan\u2019s friend who was the same age as him but two years under him in school, they were not best friends. Ethan guessed because Stacy was of course still absolutely into anime while he, although he did not hate it, was not as enthusiastic as her about it. Lilly who was now Ethan\u2019s sister and seemed to have skipped two years in school which meant that she was in the same year as Ethan. The could not find out the reason for that, but it did not matter for them right now. Lilly was also still considered Ethan\u2019s best friend. From some comments they could make the guess that the two were practically always together which lead to some people thinking that there was something going on between Ethan and Lilly. It did not help those rumors that neither he nor Lilly had any kind of relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich would mean two things: My affection for Lilly got transferred to Stacy and I am still too scared to tell the person I love that I love her but because of our differing interests we are not as close as Lilly and I are. Or I still love Lilly which seems plausible considering how close I still am to her. This of course would mean that I am hot for my sister which makes me kind of uncomfortable even though I know that she actually isn\u2019t my sister!\u201d, thought Ethan as the two ended their research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reality certainly changed much\u201d, said Lilly and looked at him. \u201cBut it is exciting, isn\u2019t it? We should stay like this for at least until tomorrow evening. I want to see how school is for us now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ethan was still confused whether he really was hot for his sister now, which would be true in either possible scenario, he had to admit that this reality was interesting. It also meant that he could even spend more time with Lilly which was a big plus. No going home for because it is too late. The two could hang out together and watch movies all night long. Okay, probably not all night long, it was a school night after all, but longer than normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me\u201d, said Ethan. \u201cI am looking forward to how everyone reacts in school. Although these rumors that we two are in a relationship worry me. We are brother and sister right now, that would be just wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at him. \u201cWell, are we in a relationship?\u201d, she asked him to which he replied with furiously shaking his head which lead to his long, red hair splashing into his face. \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? Rumors are rumors. We\u2019re in high school, people make up stuff because they\u2019re bored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. She had a point. It really did not matter what the others thought, they wanted to think what want anyway. Also, they won\u2019t stay in this reality forever. So why be bothered by some rumors?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then, sis\u2026 We still have time until mom and dad arrive, and we must eat dinner. What do you want to do?\u201d, asked Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at him and her face changed to her thinking face. \u201cWell, bro\u2026\u201d, she said, more to herself but she still wanted Ethan to hear it. \u201cHow about we watch TV? Nothing special, just brother and sister sitting in front of the TV and having fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was surprised. Considering her enthusiasm towards the swaps he had anticipated that she wanted to use the swapplet more, maybe swapping with the neighbours, but doing nothing? He was not sure if she did it because he was visibly exhausted or if she was planning something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, why not?\u201d, he shrugged. His feet were aching too much, he was just glad that he could now sit down and do nothing that is even remotely related with walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went downstairs and made themselves comfortable on the couch in front of the big, flat screen TV. Ethan handed her the remote, not really caring what they watched as long as he did not have to move his feet one inch. Lilly gladly took the remote and began zapping. She soon found a reality show she liked. Ethan never understood her interest in these boring shows, but he did not mind it right now. At least he could spend time with the girl of his dreams, that was all that mattered. Even if said girl was not his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo brain. Way to break the mood!\u201d, he thought and tried to ban this thought from his head. She was not really his sister at least not for him! He turned his attention back to the TV and hoped that the shows would be at least half interesting that he would stop thinking about stuff like that. Unfortunately, it did not work. While he sat there he began thinking about all the implications his situation right now had and why people thought the two were an item. It started to bother him but luckily his mother soon arrived home, greeting what she thought were her children and began preparing dinner. This made him stop thinking about all of this. At least for a while. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dinner was uneventful like always. Ethan\u2019s mother asked her two children, although one was not really her child, not that she knew, how their day went, what they did and so on. During the conversation which made some unexpected turns, like his mother asking him if he wanted to go bra shopping with her, Ethan again noticed how bizarre his situation was right now. He had his crushes long, red hair on his head and her vagina, including her whole reproduction system, between his legs. On his chest were the two breasts of his French teacher, being held by her bra. He had also acquired his mother\u2019s purses, but he had no interest in ever giving them back, so he should stop thinking about them as his mother\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more bizarrely was that his crush, who had his short, blond hair and his penis, was now sitting at dinner table and his parents were acting like she was their daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Ethan and Lilly got up and wanted to go upstairs but their mother stopped them. She reminded them that it was their turn to do the dishes which made Ethan sigh. \u201cBecause of the swapplet I have to do the dishes twice in a row\u201d, he thought as he brought the dishes to the sink. \u201cThe thing can have downsides\u2026 Apparently\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dishes were done, the two got upstairs into what was now Lilly\u2019s room. Sure, they could have gone to Ethan\u2019s room, not that it really mattered, but they could go to Ethan\u2019s room any time. Going to Lilly\u2019s room that was warped to fit into Ethan\u2019s house and more specifically into the dimension of Stacy\u2019s former room, that was not something they had access to everyday. Well, at least unless they don\u2019t decide that Lilly should simply swap rooms with Stacy forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so strange\u2026\u201d, mumbled Lilly. \u201cIt just looks like my room, only with a few alterations to make it fit into the different and a bit smaller shape of Stacy\u2019s room. Kinda freaky if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. \u201cYeah\u2026 Anyway, wanna watch a movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \u201cSounds great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan and Lilly did just that. They grabbed a DVD and watched a comedy movie, just like they always did. If it were not for the different room, it was a normal evening for the two. The benefit that Lilly did not have to go home also meant that they could watch even more movies together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d, Lilly said as they had just finished the first movie and began inserting the next one in the dvd player. \u201cI really enjoyed the dinner today. It was nice having two parents who genuinely care for you. Not like my mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can imagine\u201d, mumbled Ethan. \u201cI have to say it was more fun with you. I mean, there was a continuous conversation. With Stacy there is always this interruption when she starts talking about animes or her cosplays. Just not something I am interested in\u2026 Or my parents. But mom always tries to at least fake interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be nice\u2026 Sorry for dragging you down like this\u201d, she said and sat down beside him. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something more cheerful. Now that I know that you are not gay, I have been thinking. You said that I know her. But who could it be? That bothered me the whole time, but it suddenly dawned on me. I mean, it was so obvious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s heart began beating so hard that he feared that it might pop out of his chest and land in Lilly\u2019s lap. Was she really talking about that? Did she really figure it out? He could not have been any happier right now. She finally knows that he loves her! He could have never told her directly but this\u2026 This was awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 er\u2026 you figured it out, eh?\u201d, stuttered Ethan, breathing heavily and feeling his head burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I mean, how could I not? It was almost so obvious! All the little things. It all adds up. Okay, yeah, you only notice the whole picture when you know that you are too awkward and shy to actually tell the person\u201d, she continued, and Ethan gulped when he heard everything. He felt so hot right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can only be Nicole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d, replied Ethan before realising what she had actually said. He was so engrossed in his fantasies that he did not really listen to Lilly and simply replied. Moments later he noticed his mistake and wanted to correct her, but his anxieties came back. What if she did not like him the same way he did? What if it destroyed their friendship? Thus, Ethan kept quiet and let Lilly think it was Nicole that he was in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was Lilly\u2019s best female friend. While Lilly was not the typical fashion girl, not that she did not enjoy dressing feminine and fashionable, she just enjoyed more things than shopping and wearing the latest trends, Nicole on the other hand lived for fashion. It was a disaster for her if her skirt would not go well with her and stuff like that. She was not the kind of girl Ethan would ever consider liking. As far as he was concerned, he tolerated her. To this day he never understood how Lilly and Nicole could be friends, given the limited common interests they had, but somehow it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it\u201d, smiled Lilly broadly. \u201cAnd I think I can help you with this. If you want we can swap friends, so you can get to know her better. This would definitely help you with asking her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, if being friends with the girl you love would actually help\u2026\u201d, thought Ethan depressed but replied: \u201cThanks\u2026 We er\u2026 should do it sometime after this swap\u2026 This whole being your brother thing is enough for now, I guess. I want to explore this reality as it is right now. It would make things way too complicated, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded and seemed to be pleased with his answer. She then turned her attention back to the TV and started the movie. Ethan was glad that she did not want to talk him into swapping now. He wished he could have told her, but he was too afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid Ethan\u2026\u201d, he thought. \u201cYou will never be happy if you continue being such a coward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were silent for the rest of the movie. Just an occasional laugh, a snarky remark about how stupid two characters were acting. Ethan really enjoyed the time they spent together and tried his best to come up with a plan of how to avoid getting Nicole as his friend. Sadly, he could not come up with a plan that did not involve him getting more courageous. Thus, the movie ended, and Ethan was non the wiser what he should do about his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to ask you\u2026 Does it bother you that we have switched genitals? I mean, it\u2019s a unique experience for sure but do you wish to swap back?\u201d, she asked him and uncomfortably adjusted her penis in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d, responded Ethan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me at all. And you offered me to keep it for the rest of the day, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded slowly. \u201cYeah, I did\u2026 It\u2019s just\u2026 Well\u2026 My panties are a bit uncomfortable. I thought about not wearing some, but I felt that would send the wrong signal to most of the boys in school. The rest of the school day, I was in Mr. Anderson\u2019s clothes\u2026 So, no problem there\u2026 But now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. He understood her problem. \u201cIf you want we can swap back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head. \u201cNo. I promised you, you can keep it for the night, maybe for the rest of the school day\u2026 We\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re uncomfortable\u2026 Well, you could just not wear panties to bed, I mean it\u2019s late already\u201d, suggested Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 But I thought\u2026 I really enjoy having your penis between my legs\u2026 Maybe we could stay like this until I swap back with your sister\u2026 And maybe we could swap underwear? You know, my panties for your boxer shorts\u201d, she said, her face bright red and she was not able to look him into the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan simply nodded, not sure what he should say to that request. He took the swapplet and quietly made the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d, whispered Lilly as her tight panties formed into Ethan\u2019s boxer shorts while the reverse happened for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem\u2026\u201d, he replied. He also was not able to look her into the eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s late\u2026 I better go to bed now\u2026\u201d. As fast as he could, he hurried out of the room and into his own room. \u201cWhy was I so bothered with her swapping underwear? It should be no big deal considering we already swapped private parts\u201d, he thought. \u201cIt was probably Lilly\u2019s behaviour\u2026 I noticed that she was uncomfortable and so I was as well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sat down on his bed and began looking down. The two big breasts he had acquired from Ms. Dufour were blocking his view to his crotch. For a moment he wondered if he should brush his teeth and get ready for bed before he even thought about playing with his new toys but he heard Lilly enter the bathroom that the two now shared. He had no idea how long she needed in the bathroom. The two have not had a sleepover since they hit puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess, I play now\u2026\u201d, he mumbled and began groping his big breasts. \u201cAnd I can clean up later\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, being a boy, he did not have a big mirror in his room. He never saw need for one until now. Luckily, he had another idea. He booted his computer and started his web cam. He could see himself on the computer screen, with the big breasts that were seemingly almost popping out of his T-shirt and the smooth crotch. He undressed and revealed the black, lacy bra he had already seen in the teacher\u2019s bathroom this morning and the mismatching pink, cotton panties that belonged to Lilly until a few minutes ago. \u201cSadly, the two items don\u2019t match\u2026 But I can\u2019t blame Lilly for wanting to wear something comfortable\u2026 Although, I doubt that I possess any matching pairs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan got rid of the rest of his clothing and began with his fun that lasted for quite a while until he fell asleep shortly after his climax.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning came sooner than Ethan would have wanted. Groggily he was awoken by his alarm clock and at first wondered why it was so chill in his room. He then remembered what he did last night and looked down on his naked body on which he now found the breasts of his french teacher and the vagina of his childhood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smile, Ethan got out of his bed to get something to put on. Even though most of his body was not his own, he did not want his mother, father or even Lilly see him like this. \u201cAt least a bit of decency... Although Lilly probably knows that thing between my legs quite well\u201d, he thought and grabbed a shirt that amazingly fitted him although he had these big breasts. That did not mean that it was not very restricting around his chest area, but he figured that it would have ripped if it had not adjusted. He then grabbed a new pair of panties, pink ones, \u201cBecause why the hell not?\u201d and exited his room to get to the bathroom he and his sister shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, who was now living in Stacy\u2019s old room, seemed to have the same idea as him and exited her room at the same time, wearing only a purple nightgown and boxer shorts. \u201cI see your awake as well, my dear brother\u201d, grinned Lilly and looked him over from head to toe. \u201cYou enjoyed your night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr yeah\u2026 I did\u2026\u201d, mumbled Ethan, slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you did\u201d, replied Lilly, grinning even wider. \u201cAnd probably half the town knows how you enjoyed your night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s face turned a bright red. \u201cWas I that loud?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at him, putting a finger at her chin, her face changing to a thinking expression. \u201cI may be exaggerating, when I say half the town knows, but at least I know. These walls aren\u2019t as thick as you might hope. But don\u2019t worry, I expected you wanted to have fun with my vagina in combination with those boobs. How could I blame you? And to be honest, I had some fun myself.\u201d She pointed to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan, taken back by her honesty, slowly regained his composure. \u201cYeah\u2026 Well, I gotta get ready, so if you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d, he changed the subject and moved closer to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u201d. Lilly noticed what he was about to do and grabbed his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s also my bathroom and I also have to get ready, so step aside, bro. Ladies first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look more like a lady than you\u201d, slipped it out of Ethan, referring to her now short, blond hair and the obvious bulge in her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you do\u201d, replied Lilly. \u201cBut you still are considered male, while I am considered female. Besides, it won\u2019t take that long. I have no long hair to worry about, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d, sighed Ethan. \u201cGo ahead, I\u2019ll wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled. \u201cThanks\u201d, she said and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll hurry, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gulped as he looked after Lilly, who disappeared in the bathroom. She had never kissed him on the cheek. He could not explain her behavior. \u201cMaybe because of the swap? Maybe she thinks showing such affection is more okay now because we\u2019re considered siblings right now?\u201d, he thought and went back to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided against his urge to log on Facebook and try to find out more about this reality. The few things he found out yesterday were enough for him. \u201cAlthough I know it is Lilly, the thought of people thinking that I am in love with my sister\u2026 It just makes me feel uncomfortable\u2026 But considering the circumstances, I kinda am in love with my sister. Only that I know that she is not my sister. Ugh, this is complicated\u201d, he thought frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on his bed, his breasts jiggling heavily without the support of a bra. He cupped and weighed them. \u201cThese are really nice\u2026 Maybe\u2026 Maybe I should keep them, just like I want to keep mom\u2019s purses. It\u2019s not like Ms. Dufour will miss them, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis let his gaze wander over to the swapplet, that he laid down on his desk. It was really careless of him to let it lay around just in the open, even when it was just in his room. What if his mother walked in and grabbed it? Not to imagine what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need a good hiding place, that\u2019s for sure\u2026 For now, I should put it in my purse. I doubt that mom would look through it. Then again, I sincerely doubt that my mother would walk in when I am in the shower, it\u2019s not the weekend so no cleaning. But better safe then sorry\u201d, he thought and grabbed the swapplet. He took a small, black leather purse and put the swapplet in. Then he put the purse back into his wardrobe, beside his other purses. \u201cAnd even better, when I hide it in an unused purse. It has its advantages that mom loves to collect purses. Or used to, seems I am the one with this habit now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the swapplet stored away safely, Ethan was now without a task to do while he waited for Lilly to get ready. So, he took his phone and began to play some games on it until Lilly finally knocked on the door and told him that the bathroom is unoccupied now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough\u201d, he said to her and hurried to the bathroom without waiting for her reply. He really had to pee now. He slammed the bathroom door behind him, yanked his panties down and almost jumped on the toilet seat. Relieved he relaxed himself and let nature take its course. \u201cJust in time\u201d, he mumbled satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished he wiped his vagina and thought for a brief moment whether or nor he should masturbate now. He decided against it, he had to hurry to not be late to school. Wanting to shower after his last night, he grabbed a clip that he found and got his hair off his shoulder. \u201cWill be weird to shower and try to not get my hair wet, but to dry it off would take too long. I should swap it back with Lilly soon, I don\u2019t want to take care of her hair. Too much of a hassle\u201d, he thought and entered the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Ethan\u2019s willpower to keep himself from playing with himself in the shower. The orbs on his chest as well as the slit between his legs were too tempting not to use, but he had no time for that. \u201cI hope I can convince Lilly to let me keep her vagina for a night longer\u201d, he thought with a grin as he exited the shower and dried himself with a towel. \u201cI could really get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was all dried up, he redressed in his shirt and panties, not wanting to go out naked and returned to his room, only to find it not empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you are doing, \u2018sis\u2019?\u201d, asked Ethan as he entered his room, which caused Lilly, who was rummaging through his room, to startle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re finished already?\u201d, she asked shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I kept my hair up, but you didn\u2019t answer my question\u201d, he replied and looked at her sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u201d, Lilly began, rubbing her neck. \u201cI was looking for the swapplet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to use it?\u201d, asked Ethan disbelievingly. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be using it too much, it might draw attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but it would be in the house, which limits the people who could even notice the device\u201d, said Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are into it, right?\u201d, he said as he thought about letting her do one small swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh\u201d, she replied. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be? With all what this little thing can do, I\u2019d prefer to grab it, go out and swap everyone who is in my sights. A big fucking swapping spree!\u201d. Ethan raised his eyebrow which caused Lilly to quickly add. \u201cI know, I know. Too dangerous, in case somebody else saw it come down and everything. That doesn\u2019t make it any less tempting to use it. So please, let me do one small swap. Just one eenie-teenie-weenie-little swap, ok?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took a step back as he saw what Lilly was about to do. She looked at him with her puppy dog eyes, something he could never say no to. Luckily for him, it did not have the same effect as usual, now that she had his short hair. \u201cBut what harm could it have to let her do one swap though?\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

And in the house, it would be impossible for someone to see that they have the device. \u201cAnd so far, nobody tried to get the device or anything, so it is highly likely that, except me, nobody saw it landing. Still, we should wait a bit longer before we can say that for sure\u201d, he thought, while looking in Lilly\u2019s puppy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine\u201d, he sighed, which made Lilly jump in joy and clap in her hands. \u201cBut under two conditions\u201d, added Ethan with a serious face. \u201cOne, no swaps involving me. I\u2019m swapped up enough. Two, the swapplet stays inside this house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah, fine. No gimme, gimme\u201d, she said like an impatient child, which in turn made Ethan sigh even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI seriously regret showing you the swapplet\u201d, he told her as he walked over to his wardrobe. \u201cI understand that it has some amazing powers, but we shouldn't use it all the time. Even with the reality altering effects, people will notice us using the thing. It lacks any logos, meaning people will get interested in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah\", said Lilly, whose enthusiasm got a serious dampener thanks to Ethan. \u201cYou worry too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan scolded her with a look. \u201cOkay, okay. You're right. No mass swaps and keep the swapplet as much hidden as possible. So, could you now pretty please get the device so that I can fulfil my dark desires\u201d, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery theatrical, but fine.\u201d Ethan opened his wardrobe and got the swapplet out of his hiding purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know why I haven't thought about looking through your purses\u201d, mumbled Lilly just loud enough so that Ethan could hear it. \u201cBut it would have been impossible to find such a small device in your millions of purses. Seriously, how can a guy buy so many purses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. She doesn't know about the purse swap. For her it's normal for me to have purses and I always had\u201d, he thought as he handed her the swapplet. \u201cHere you go\u201d, he said to her, ignoring her comment about the amount of his purses. \u201cAnyways, what do you want to swap anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly gladly took the tablet and began touching its display. \u201cWell, at first I wanted to swap you with your mom. Giving you her clothes. Because you have the body for it right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why would it have to be with mom and not with you?\u201d, asked Ethan who remembered the night where he had his mothers clothing and masturbated in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I like my clothes? Sorry but I am really not interested in wearing boys clothes right now\u201d, she explained. \u201cAnyways, since you forbid me swapping you with anyone, I have no idea what I want to swap right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen hand the swapplet over and let me hide it again\u201d, said Ethan and stretched out his hand to the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d, said Lilly and took a step away from Ethan. \u201cEven when I don\u2019t know what to swap YET, that doesn't mean I won't swap anything today. I want to use it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head and sighed. \u201cFine. Whatever. Take the swapplet and go, swap something. As long as you stay in the house, I don't care. I'm going to get dressed and such and when I get down, you better have done the swap or else you won't get to do a swap today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really make this more like work and less like fun but fine\u201d, groaned Lilly. \u201cJust take your time, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Lilly left the room. Ethan shook his head and began looking for something to wear today. \u201cI hope her enthusiasm won\u2019t be our downfall in the end. I can understand her, but too many swaps are still too dangerous\u201d, he thought as he casually browsed through his array of shirts, astounded how they had changed in size and shape to accommodate for his changed bust size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least they are still clearly for a guy\u201d, he thought relieved and looked down at the shirt he had grabbed earlier. \u201cAlthough they feel kinda tight in certain areas\u2026 To show off?\u201d. He shrugged and began looking through his underwear. He had already grabbed a pair of fresh, pink panties earlier, so he looked for a matching pink bra. This endeavour was harder than first anticipated. He had swapped bras and panties with two different people, meaning he did not get full pairs. Ms. Dufour obviously had more mature, lacy and sexy underwear which did not match all to well with Lilly\u2019s plain underwear, with only one or two items that Ms. Dufour would even consider wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe not-so-male boy settled on a bright pink bra with a lacy flower motive. It was the only item that he thought matches remotely the plain pink panties he wore. Every other male in his situation probably could not have cared any less for how good the two clothing items matched but Ethan was different. He had always fantasised about this stuff, so of course he wanted it to look good. Plus, if he squinted just enough when looking in a mirror, he probably could forget that it was his body with boobs and a vagina and instead imagine it belonged to a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s for later\u201d, he thought and tried putting on the bra. He at first tried getting the clips together behind his back but soon found at that this was too difficult if not straight up impossible for him. So he fastened the clips in the front, turned the bra around, put his arms through the straps and lastly put his two breasts in the lacy cups. As soon as he finished this procedure, he felt like a big weight was being lifted from his chest, now that his breasts were supported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he put his shirt back on, briefly noting that you could see the outlines of his bra through the shirt. He cupped his now hidden breasts and squeezed them. A pleasurable feeling flooded him. \u201cI might definitely keep them, although I can only imagine the back pain after a while\", he thought as he let go of his breasts and began looking for some jeans. He simply grabbed the first pain he found and finished his outfit with black sneakers. He then grabbed his school purse and then pondered whether he should give Lilly more time for her swap or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe better be ready by now, I'm not gonna sit around here just to give her more time\", he thought and left his room, going downstairs. There he found Lilly who was happily holding the swapplet in her hand. Ethan noticed that she had just swapped something with...</span></div></div>",

Ethan could never do such a thing to Lilly, his feelings for her were way to strong and he hoped that she would not see through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down\u201d, she said, raising her hands in defence. \u201cWe know each other since we were small kids. I would never jeopardize our friendship over something like that.\u201d She then looked at the swapplet and added quietly: \u201cBut it is quite tempting\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan just shook his head and then looked at her. \u201cSo\u2026 What did you swap?\u201d, he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything different on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you didn\u2019t allow me to swap you with your mom and I had not interest in swapping with your dad\u201d, Lilly began to explain and ignored Ethan\u2019s \u201chypocrite\u201d commentary as she continued. \u201cI thought about what would be interesting to swap and came to the following conclusion: How about I swap my name with your mother? It would be interesting that I am not only your sister but also have your mothers name!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo, I have to call you Susan now?\u201d, he summarised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically. Anyway, let\u2019s eat breakfast and then go to school, bro\u201d, she grinned and went over to the kitchen, handing him the swapplet which he immediately put into his purse. Ethan simply shook his head and followed her. The swap she did was so pointless, like she just wanted to swap for the sake of swapping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should look out for her... This behaviour can\u2019t be healthy... Ah well, a problem for another day\u201d, thought Ethan as took place on his usual seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was as unusual as ever. Well, as unusual as it could be when thinking about last nights dinner. The only difference was that his mother called Lilly Susan. Neither he nor Lilly called her by her changed name and his dad did neither during breakfast. So, they had to go to school without experiencing the other side of this swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, quite a bummer how little this swap is\u201d, sighed Lilly as the two left home. \u201cHow about another swap for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head as he closed the door behind him. \u201cI guess this behaviour is what will bring us in trouble. Addicted to swapping and shouting our secret out loud, so that the whole neighbourhood can hear us\u201d, he said and walked beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a knot, will ya? Also, you are just as loud as I am right now\u201d, countered Lilly, even louder this time, before continuing much quieter. \u201cBut yeah, you are right. This power is addicting, and it makes me careless. Good thing I have you on my side to watch my back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled broadly. He enjoyed that his crush was making him compliments and that he was being needed by her. He was also glad that she understood his concerns. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that you understand\u201d, he replied quietly. \u201cWe can\u2019t be careful enough or we might-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was suddenly interrupted as he walked into something. Since it felt soft, at least softer than a lamp post or a wall, the first thought running through his head was \u201cPhew, I haven\u2019t embarrassed myself by running against something like that like an idiot\u201d. It was after that, that he grasped the whole situation and figured that he must have bumped into a person. This was soon confirmed by the familiar female voice he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, you seem to be in quite a rush\u201d, he heard the voice of Andrea Jefferson, or Mrs. Jefferson how Ethan usually called her, his next-door neighbour. She was a kind 40-something year old single mother. Her husband simply disappeared 6 years ago, presumably to be with another woman, leaving her alone with her now 16-year-old daughter. Her daughter Veronica blamed her mother for her father\u2019s disappearance, resulting in a strained relationship between the two. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe nice guy that Ethan most of the times is, he tried to be nice to her during those times. That\u2019s why she acts very motherly towards him and wished she could have him as a son. Her affectionate behaviour around Ethan, namely hugging and the likes, made Lilly dislike her. For Lilly it felt like she would try to be with Ethan in a man-woman kind of relationship, which was gross considering the age difference as well as making Lilly jealous. Not that Ethan had noticed anything like that regarding either Lilly or Mrs. Jefferson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mrs. Jefferson\u201d, apologized Ethan and looked down on the ground, feeling totally embarrassed. Thankfully, she just smiled at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing happened\u201d, she then looked over to Lilly with the same warm smile. \u201cGood morning, Susan. How is my favourite girl today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly was a bit awestruck by this. Mrs. Jefferson was nice but she never called her \u201cher favourite girl\u201d. \u201cCould it be that because I\u2019m her neighbour now, that I have been nicer and less jealous towards her and in return she became nicer to me as well?\u201d, thought Lilly. \u201cCould it be that I was wrong and the poor woman was really just looking for a child replacement? As much hate there was between her and her daughter she never had said anything bad about her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks for asking\u201d, replied Lilly as soon as she got her composure back. \u201cI hope the same goes for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jeffersons face briefly turned sad but her smile came back just as quick. \u201cAh, the usual, you know? You two seem in a hurry, so I don\u2019t want to bother you any longer. Don\u2019t forget you can come to me any time you wish, I could make some cake, if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to hug the two in a motherly way before returning to her house. Lilly looked after her, wondering if she was wrong about her all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan simply walked on. \u201cNice to see that she seems to like you more in this reality Maybe being her neighbour makes you nicer. Or mom forces you to be nice\u201d, said Ethan but got no reaction from Lilly. Not wanting to her anger her, he dropped the topic and the two went silently to school. That was until the silence was cut off as they walked around the school corner where Ethan collided with yet another person. This time it was Keiko Yamaoka, the shy and clumsy freshman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the instance with Mrs. Jefferson, the impact was strong enough to throw both to the ground, the contents of Ethan\u2019s purse as well as Keikos backpack that she was just looking through being strawn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u201d, repeated Keiko over and over again like a mantra. Her face, which was mostly covered in long, black hair, was bright red. She immediately began gathering her contents. Ethan briefly saw the swapplet lying on the ground and quickly shoved it back into his purse before Keiko, who was gathering the stuff with an efficiency like she does this at least three times a day, could see it. Ethan then started to gather his own stuff, this time more calm and slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It was my fault as well, could have looked where I was going\u201d, he said to her and then wondered about how many times he will walk into people today. \u201cI hope you\u2019re alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko, who had already finished gathering her stuff, had already stood up and looked on the ground, clutching her backpack tight to her chest. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine\u201d, she said quickly while looking to the ground, her face still red. \u201cI gotta go\u201d, she whispered and quickly ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird girl\u201d, mumbled Lilly and looked over to Ethan. \u201cGood thing you reacted quickly with the swapplet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. \u201cYeah, would have been really bad if she took it by mistake. Or asked what it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head. \u201cI doubt she would have asked what it was. She is way too shy for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t swap me with someone who usually runs into people, haven\u2019t you?\u201d, he asked, trying to find a reason for his bad luck right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Lilly shook her head and simply grinned wide. \u201cNope, that is just your bad luck. Or maybe these big titties of yours have their own gravitational field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan simply sighed and the two entered the school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two entered the school\u2019s hallway and Ethan noticed how different it felt now that he was a student again. Nobody looked at him lustfully or envious, which probably was the result of not being Ms. Dufour anymore. It was also nice to walk through the halls without a click-clack echo that told everyone \u201chere I am!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friend-turned-siblings went to their lockers that were still next to each other and still in the same location. On their way they were greeted by some students like every morning, the only difference being that Lilly was called Susan by them. She was a bit disappointed that almost nothing had changed but it was to be expected. People would not treat them completely different just because Ethan and she were now brother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly and Ethan were just getting their stuff out of their lockers as they heard a familiar voice behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE!\u201d, said a voice behind Ethan and seconds later he felt a hand pat his back. \u201cGood morning, you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan turned around and looked in the face of his other best friend Keith. Keith always called Ethan E as a nickname. Ethan did not really like it but over the years he began tolerating it. Lilly on the other hand found it very annoying, just like she found Keith obnoxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning\u201d, said Ethan as his friend turned around to look at Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you look as lovely as ever, Susan\u201d, he said with a big smile on his face. \u201cHave you thought about our date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDate?\u201d, thought Ethan surprised. \u201cHe never made any attempts with Lilly before. Why would he want to date her now that she was my sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, just as surprised as Ethan was, shook her head and quickly excused herself, saying that she needed to use the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith sighed and looked after Lilly. \u201cSusan doesn\u2019t know what she is missing\u201d, he said. \u201cMan, must be really hard to have such a smart and hot sister. If I were you, I would definitely peak into the bathroom when she is in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you believe this crap with me and my sister being a couple?\u201d, asked Ethan, split between wanting this conversation to end and curious to the changes in this reality. Why was Keith in love with Lilly? Did that mean that he was always in love with her? Then why did he not try anything? Did he know that Ethan had feelings for Lilly? Ethan never told him but maybe he figured it out? Maybe Keith had a crush on Stacy but considering the age gap he did not tell Ethan and now that Lilly was basically in Stacy\u2019s position he had a crush on Lilly. The swap simply transferred the crush from one sister to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I know that the rumours aren\u2019t true. But you gotta admit, they seem quite plausible. You two are joined by the hip so to say\u201d, said Keith. \u201cBut, I know an easy way to get rid of the rumours: Help me get together with your sister. People will stop thinking that you are dating your sister and I get to be with a hot girl. Everyone wins, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept that I a.) love Lilly and b.) am not sure if this wouldn\u2019t result in you getting together with Stacy as soon as we change everything to normal\u201d, thought Ethan but replied: \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019ll talk to her, but I can\u2019t make any promises. It\u2019s her choice after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith grinned broadly. \u201cFinally, you come to your senses. I knew if I nag you long enough with this, you will eventually give in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends continued to chat for a bit until Ethan had to excuse himself just like Lilly did, only difference being that he really needed to go to the bathroom. It felt refreshing for Ethan to talk with Keith. It was nice to have a conversation with someone that did not involve swapping one\u2019s body parts around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan found Lilly waiting for him at the bathroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into Keith?\u201d, she asked Ethan the instant he was in hearing range. \u201cHe never tried anything towards me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan just shrugged. \u201cBeats me. Either he always had a crush on you and for some reason, now that you are my sister he tries it or, and this is the more disturbing thought, he had a crush on my sister, mainly because she is my sister, and now that transferred over to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shuddered. \u201cEither way, I don\u2019t like it\u2026 By the way, bad news for you, I texted Nicole and she is sick today. I know it must be hard not seeing your crush. Maybe we both should swing by and bring her homework.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, er, unfortunately I can\u2019t, Keith wanted to do some er guy stuff with me after school. Yeah that\u2019s right\u201d, lied Ethan and hurried into the bathroom. \u201cGotta pee\u201d, he told her as the door closed, feeling relieved to have escaped this conversation for now. He did not want to imagine that Nicole might also have a crush on him for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly finished his business, slightly annoyed that he could not use the urinal anymore, now that he lacked the equipment. \u201cBut the masturbation makes up for that\u201d, he thought and felt his genitals become damp. \u201cDamn, not now.\u201d Before anything else could happen, he left the bathroom as quickly as he had entered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was fast\u201d, said an amused Lilly. \u201cI hope you washed your hands. Anyway, I have been thinking-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d, interrupted Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t even heard me out\u201d, she whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I already know what you want and no, we won\u2019t use the swapplet in school. Too many people who might want to know what it is or happen to take a glance at the display\u201d, he said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, come on. You took it with you to school, so why shouldn\u2019t we use it? We have to learn the capabilities of that thing!\u201d, she tried to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head. \u201cWe already know the capabilities. We did every sort of swap there is, and we know everything by simply having touched the device. There is no such thing as \u2018we have to test it out\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt we did every sort of swap so far\u201d, mumbled Lilly. \u201cMaybe it broke as it fell down\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt survived a crush from outer space into my backyard, do you really think it would break from such a small fall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I get it, I get it\u2026 No swapplet in school. You\u2019re right. What would I do without you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly came closer and hugged him. Ethan was stunned by this sudden act of tenderness and did not notice that Lilly got the swapplet out of his purse. Grinning broadly, she held the swapplet victorious in his face. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blinked surprised and needed a moment to process what just happened. He then followed her as fast as he could through the student filled hallways. He caught her soon after but not because he was faster. Lilly was looking horrified at the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not the swapplet. It\u2019s a normal tablet\u201d, she said to him and looked with big, horrified eyes at him. \u201cKeiko has to have it. There is no other explanation. You must have grabbed her tablet instead of the swapplet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s face took on the same horrified expression as Lilly\u2019s. \u201cShit\u201d, he mumbled. \u201cWe gotta get it back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, duh\u201d, she replied. \u201cOnly problem is, we have class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the school wanted to give her statement more weight, the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't care, let\u2019s skip class\u201d, he said agitated. \u201cGetting the swapplet back is more important right now! Just imagine what she might do with it. We can\u2019t let her have it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! But we don\u2019t even know her classes! I doubt the hall monitor would appreciate it when we wander around aimlessly and bother every class we can find\u201d, she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what else should we do? Simply wait until after school? It might be too late then! Best case scenario would be that I haven\u2019t noticed tablet missing yet. But the longer we wait the more likely it is that she notices. We got to move now and quickly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd was we have at least until lunch. She as a shy student, as far as I know. I mean, if it wouldn't be for her clumsiness, nobody in school would even know that she exists and shy students are always good students that would never dare to miss a single word of the classes. That's why I'd say she won't look at it until lunch\", reasoned Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kinda doubt your prejudice is true\u201d, said Ethan, thinking of his options. \u201cI think...\u201d</span></div></div>",

We have to do damage control now!\u201d, Ethan said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u201d, sighed Lilly. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope, we don\u2019t get into trouble. But how do you suppose we find her? We can\u2019t possibly go from class to class and look for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan grinned. \u201cEasy. We have her tablet, right? Please tell me she is a lazy person and doesn\u2019t lock her tablet with a pin or something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can it be easy if we have to get through her swipe lock\u2026\u201d, sighed Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny better ideas? Just give me the thing\u201d, he said, stretching out his arm and grabbing the tablet. Lilly, out of any useful ideas, simply gave the device to him and waited for what her friend might do. Said friend began swiping on the tablet, trying various combinations. Just when there was one last attempt left before permanently locking the device, Ethan got lucky and found the right pattern. Triumphantly he looked over to Lilly and held the device victoriously in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Easy\u201d, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe really have a different understanding of the word easy\u2026 So, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, my fair lady\u201d, he began, trying to sound intellectual. \u201cWe will look if she has a time table or something like that in here. Like for example this one.\u201d He turned the device, so she could see his discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head. \u201cYour plan basically is getting lucky and apparently you have all the fool\u2019s luck in the world. So let's see... She apparently has P.E. right now. Poor thing, P.E. in the morning is no fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, our luck\u201d, said Ethan. \u201cWe might get into contact with her without making too much of a buzz. Hopefully, she didn't notice anything so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy even bother talking to her?\u201d, asked Lilly. \u201cShe won't have it with her during class, so let's sneak into the locker room and take the device. If she did find out, she might have thought it was only her imagination or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was excited and terrified at the same time to break into the girl\u2019s locker room. On one hand, like every other boy in school, he was interested in getting in there. The forbidden land. On the other hand, if they do get caught, his punishment would be more severe than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, we have to basically look through the whole locker room to find her locker and then see if she has the tablet\u201d, sighed Ethan. \u201cSounds easy enough\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuckily for us, I still know what her backpack looks like. It will be a piece of cake\u201d, smiled Lilly, now gotten her enthusiasm back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded slowly, still dreading what might happen. The two then started to walk to the gym. The hallways cleared pretty soon and half way on their journey they were the only students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we meet the hall monitor, we\u2019ll simply say we have to hurry\u201d, whispered Ethan. \u201cThis excuse won\u2019t work on our way back though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou worry too much, Ethan\u201d, whispered Lilly back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you worry too little, \u2018Susan\u2019!\u201d, replied Ethan angrily and stopped, looking right at Lilly. \u201cYou are far too careless with everything! All you think about is swapping here, swapping there! Even now you don\u2019t seem to understand the whole situation. Can you even imagine what might happen if this thing falls into the wrong hands? Or what some people would do to get this into their hands? Your carelessness could get us killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked back at him, her face turning angry the more he talked. \u201cAnd whose fault was it that we lost the swapplet, huh? Oh right, yours!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy fault? You could have done something as well, maybe grab the swapplet before she got it! You aren\u2019t completely innocent either!\u201d, he snapped back at her and immediately regretted it. Lilly stopped on the spot and looked to the ground. \u201cGreat\u2026\u201d, he thought. \u201cNow I\u2019m in a fight with my best friend and the love of my love, just because of this stupid thing\u2026 Maybe using it isn\u2019t the best thing the two of us could do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at her and waited for her to say something. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u201d, he said to her after a while of awkward silence. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be so harsh\u2026\u201d Lilly shook her head. \u201cNo\u2026 You\u2019re right. It\u2019s not your fault, I could have reacted faster as soon as the incident happened. To be honest, I hadn\u2019t even noticed that you grabbed her tablet\u2026 Also, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m drunken because of the power the swapplet gives us. I AM careless. Even now I didn\u2019t think of what might happen if we can\u2019t get the thing back other than that I couldn\u2019t do any more swaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at her, unsure what he should reply. He was sure that he should say something, but he had no idea what. A few heartbeats later Lilly looked at him, her eyes slightly wet from the tears she withheld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a horrible person who only thinks of her own fun. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tears ran down her cheeks. \u201cWhen we got the swapplet back, I think it would be the best if you don\u2019t allow me to use it for a while.\u201d She wiped her tears away and forced a smile on her face. \u201cBut we better hurry up, right bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she continued on their path to the locker room and left Ethan stunned behind. He felt bad for what he had said to her, even more so because he made her cry. But was it really his fault? He said the truth. He could have worded it better, but truth is truth\u2026 Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiserably he followed her, a depressing silence between the two, which helped them to avoid the hall monitor. The closer they got to the locker room the more nervous he got. When they stood in front of the door, he did not feel bad about the situation earlier because all he could think about was what might happen if he got caught in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly the two entered and Lilly immediately began searching the lockers. Ethan just stood behind and looked around. He knew that it would not look any different than the boy\u2019s locker room but still he was disappointed. \u201cAnd the main attraction is also missing\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor someone who worries so much about losing the swapplet you sure seem oddly calm now\u201d, said Lilly amused. \u201cCome on, help me find her locker. You might not have noticed because of the collision, her backpack was a black one with pink cherry blossoms on it. Can\u2019t be that hard to spot it through the small openings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gathered himself and began helping Lilly. Luckily for them, no other girl had a similar looking backpack and said backpack was, like Lilly said, fairly easy to spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what?\u201d, asked Ethan. \u201cWe can\u2019t just break this locker open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe both seem to be on a lucky streak right now. At least since after losing the swapplet. You see, this particular locker is infamous around here. If you punch the lock hard enough\u2026\u201d. Lilly punched against the lock which then made a \u2018click\u2019 noise and the locker opened. \u201cThe locker opens just like that. The school doesn\u2019t have any money to fix this thing. I don\u2019t blame Keiko for not knowing, she is a freshman after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. We really ARE lucky\u201d, said Ethan and moved over to look through Keiko\u2019s stuff.</span></div></div>",

That can\u2019t be!\u201d, said Lilly shocked, almost shouting. \u201cYou didn\u2019t look thorough enough. Let me do it.\u201d She pushed Ethan to the side and began searching everything, just like he did before but came to the same result. \u201cShit\u201d, she cursed. \u201cShe probably took it with her and is now swapping around everybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? She would show the swapplet to the whole class\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt we can simply assume that she is as worried about not showing the swapplet to the world as you are. For all we know, she could care less and just wants to have fun\u201d, explained Lilly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to her and-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped mid-sentence because she heard voices coming from the gym. Lilly quickly grabbed Ethan and dragged him over to the showers where she hid behind the door with him. Unfortunately, there was not much space for the two which resulted in Ethan and Lilly pressing their bodies against each other. Ethan\u2019s big breasts where pushing against Lilly\u2019s lovely frame. He was glad that he now did not have his penis, because he could be sure it would spring in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are forgetful, Amber\u201d, said a voice from the main room. \u201cI mean seriously, how many tampons did I have to borrow you because you forgot to bring your own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Lilly nor Ethan recognized the voices. They probably belonged to some freshman that they may have seen before but never really looked out nor have even heard their name. Lilly slowly looked around the door, being careful not to expose herself too much and being spotted and tried to get a look at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking normal\u201d, whispered Lilly. \u201cSo, either Keiko hasn\u2019t started swapping yet or these two were left unharmed for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But look at it from the bright side, will ya? We have a bit less P.E.\u201d, said the other voice as they approached the showers fairly quickly. They stopped near Keiko\u2019s locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this. The locker is open. We should tell the teacher\u201d, said one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t\u201d, giggled the other one. \u201cDon\u2019t you know? This locker is broken and can be opened by simply hammering against it. The school won\u2019t fix it and apparently, it\u2019s used for pranks against freshman. This Keiko girl is usually using it and the other girls are only waiting for the right opportunity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s mean, but it will probably funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, here is your tampon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d, the girl said and then went on to the bathroom to put it in. Ethan held his breath as the girl walked right beside the showers door to get into the bathroom. While the two waited for the girls return, Ethan was noticing something pressing against his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she getting turned on by me being so close to her?\u201d, he thought but dismissed the thought. It was probably because he slightly shifted a lot while trying to get into a somewhat close position. The rubbing probably did the rest and made the thing go erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the girl finally returned, and both left the locker room. With a big sigh of relief, Lilly stepped back from Ethan who was just as glad to have more space for himself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close\u201d, he mumbled. \u201cBack to business. We have to find out if Keiko has the device.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded and the two snuck over to the gym door. The quietly opened it and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere she is. On the bench\u201d, whispered Ethan. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

For all we know, I might have dropped it somewhere along the way and who knows who might have picked it up in the meantime! The other possibility would mean that she knows what it is capable of doing. Let\u2019s hope she has it. I seriously doubt we could get it back otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should talk to her during lunch\u201d, suggested Lilly. \u201cIt will be difficult to talk to her in private in between classes, even more so here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan agreed and the two snuck out of the locker room before any more unwelcomed girls could come back. Neither of the two had any interest to go to class, they were too scared of what was happening right now. To not get into any trouble, the two hid outsides behind the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if she really doesn\u2019t have it?\u201d, asked Ethan, who was sitting down, hugging his legs, which squished his big breasts. \u201cI doubt it is still lying somewhere on the pathway. Somebody might have taken it. Best case scenario would be that we would find that person because of the swaps he or she would make. Worst case? We have to stay like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sat beside him, he legs spread apart to give her crotch some space. \u201cWe have to think positive, right?\u201d, she said, trying to suppress crying. \u201cIt just now settles in for me what we have done to each other. As exciting as it is, I don\u2019t want to live like this for the rest of my life! I\u2019ll probably won\u2019t see my family ever again, at least not in the same way. Finding a guy will be difficult as well, I guess. I doubt I\u2019ll find someone compatible with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only compatible guy in the world sides right beside you right now\u201d, thought Ethan. He was also trying to suppress his feelings. He had feared that they might get in trouble for using it, even be killed, but he had never imagined what might happen if they could not reverse the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the same boat, I guess\u201d, she continued. \u201cAt least we have each other, right? We don\u2019t have to get through this alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know if Keiko really doesn\u2019t have the swapplet. She could have very well hidden it away, knowing of its powers\u201d, he tried to cheer himself and her up. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that we can never swap back. And I mean, even then? We still don\u2019t know the capabilities! Maybe straight guys will love your dick but find every other one disgusting.\u201d He wanted to add a comment that he and she were compatible right now, but like always he was too afraid. \u201cI mean look at Keith. He probably knows about it and he still tries to get in your pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly formed a smile. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026 And even if I don\u2019t have my whole family, I still have you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounded totally like I have just been officially friendzoned\u2026 Well, brotherzoned to be more precise\u201d, thought Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly turned her head back down to the ground, her faint smile vanishing. \u201cBut I still hate myself for all the swapping I have been doing. It was just so exciting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hate yourself. We both couldn\u2019t have thought about losing it. If you come in contact with something so powerful, the urge to use it gets big. It\u2019s natural. Let\u2019s be honest, the mistake we did wasn\u2019t about the swapping, even if you were getting careless and might have caused to expose us in the long run. No, our mistake was not looking out for the swapplet\u201d, said Ethan. \u201cBut that\u2019s that. Moping doesn\u2019t help us out\u2026 At least we haven\u2019t made any completely unbearable swaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, agreed Lilly and her smile returned and got even bigger. \u201cCould you imagine if I really swapped you with your mom and you had to wear her clothes for the rest of your life? Yeah, you could probably buy new clothes, but I think you would be forced into clothes for older women if you don\u2019t want to get weird looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. \u201cYeah, really lucky\u2026\u201d, he mumbled and shuddered at the thought. \u201cSay, I wondered, ever since your name swap\u2026 Do you feel any different? When I swapped lives with Ms. Dufour I didn\u2019t feel any different except for having her clothes and such. But I felt like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at him and then at the sky. \u201cActually, no. If it weren\u2019t for the reaction of other people, I wouldn\u2019t even know that my name is Susan now. I feel like I did before the swap. Probably because of the reality alteration. I mean, you don\u2019t think these breasts are yours, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how it is with me and my new name. I know I swapped it, I know where it comes from. It feels like using a nickname online\u201d, explained Lilly. \u201cLike I deliberately chose the name Susan and now people see it over my head, like in a video game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan chuckled. \u201cI probably better get used to call you Susan then. I might probably get confused if I call you Lilly in private and Susan in public\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked sternly at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u201d, she hissed. \u201cYou will call me Lilly whenever we two are alone, mister! It\u2019s bad enough that I probably have to live with this name from now on, I don\u2019t need my best friend refusing to call me by my real name.\u201d Her expression relaxed. \u201cThanks. It really feels good that I have at least someone to talk to in this situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame\u201d, smiled Ethan. The two continued talking like this until it was time for lunch. That\u2019s when they made their move to the cafeteria to confront Keiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the two did not have to search too long for her and even more lucky, she was sitting alone, looking through some books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, er Keiko\u201d, approached Ethan the Asian girl. \u201cI think, er, we might have swapped our tablets when we crashed into each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko looked up as Ethan put Keiko\u2019s tablet on the table.</span></div></div>",

She is lying, right? She must be\u201d, he thought and looked at her face and sighed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s lying. Shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked down and shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Thank you for your offer.\u201d He looked at Lilly who had a similar expression than his on his face, then the two left, leaving Keiko alone and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis tablet must be really precious to both of them\u2026\u201d, thought Keiko as she looked after the two. \u201cThey look like someone just died\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u201d, yelled Ethan and punched the wall. The two went back to their place by the dumpster, neither of the two being slightly interested in school. \u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d, he continued punching the wall with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly slumped down beside him. \u201cPunching the wall won\u2019t help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it helps me to not break apart\u201d, he said but stopped his attack on the wall. For now. \u201cI really want her to have lied to us. I really do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she did not. Or she is a really, really good actress\u201d, replied Lilly. \u201cBesides\u2026 Where should she have hidden the swapplet? We have to face the facts: The swapplet is lost and we are forever doomed to be like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend-turned-brother got limp and slumped down on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026\u201d, he sighed. \u201cWell, the swapping was fun as long as it lasted, eh? And we could have ended up even worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded and looked down at her feet. She tried to suppress her tears, but to no avail. The thought that she would never see her mother and little sister again. Sure, she did not always get along with them, especially her mother in the recent years, but she still loved both of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan put his arm around his friends\u2019 shoulder and she pressed her face against his chest, crying. Normally he would have been the happiest boy in the world. The girl he loved was pressing her own body against his, but the circumstances made it hard for him to even think happy thoughts. How could he? His dream girl was now his sister and was basically a she-male, although nobody would notice that. He on the other hand was a girl through and through. He would start to have periods and was probably able to give birth, something he would rather not experience. \u201cAlthough I doubt that I\u2019ll find a girl who could get me pregnant, baring a certain incestuous possibility\u201d, he thought with a touch of gallows humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stayed like this until the final school bell rang, both too absorbed in their own pity. It was Ethan who finally broke the silence. \u201cWe should better get home\u2026 And\u2026 And probably try to accept this\u2026 This is our life now\u2026\u201d, he said, not quite believing that this would be as easy as he claims it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn silence the two went back to Ethan\u2019s house, which was now also Lilly\u2019s house. Normally they would talk during the walk but today they were clearly not in the mood. Besides coming to terms with their current situation, they only looked around the pathway, hoping that there may have been a bump and the device fell out of Ethan\u2019s bag, now laying around. If this was true, they found no evidence and even more unfortunately, no device. They arrived crestfallen their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are\u2026\u201d, sighed Lilly. \u201cOur home\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still hard for her to think of it like that, but she knew it was true. She had to accept it, as hard as it was going to be. Her legs began to shake, she knew, when she crossed the threshold that there was no going back. She would have to admit that the two lost the swapplet and that there was no way to turn them back to normal. Of course, she knew that it was already the case but there was this small, frail voice in her head that told her that they could still find it, the just have to look harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan noticed how Lilly felt and took her hand, not even really thinking about what he was doing. \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d, he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded and the two went to the front door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly the Ethan opened the door and had to drag in Lilly. She clearly was not ready for what was happening, but when would you ever be? He did not blame her. While he lost his masculinity, at least in appearance, she lost her family. Sure, he now had his teachers\u2019 breasts and bra, his crushes vagina and panties, as well as her hair and not to forget his mother\u2019s purses, but at least he still had his family. \u201cExcept Stacy\u201d, he thought. \u201cBut I still have a sister\u2026 One that I\u2019d like to do things I shouldn\u2019t do to my sister, but a sister nonetheless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked in, Ethan noticed that something was wrong. He could hear someone rummaging in the kitchen. A quick look out the window confirmed his suspicion that his mother was already home, as her car was standing in the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnusual for her to be home this early on a work day\u201d, he thought as he made his way to the kitchen to meet his mother. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t feel so good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, we\u2019re home\u201d, he said smiling, trying to put up a normal face in front of his mother, not wanting to make her worry. How could he explain to her why the two were depressed right now? Mom, you\u2019re only son is anatomically a woman and your only daughter is not your daughter, but you we cannot prove any of it because we do not have the device that caused all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you home so early? Not feeling goo-\u201c, Ethan stopped as he saw who was standing in the kitchen. It was not his mother, it was Mrs. Jefferson. \u201cOh, Mrs. Jefferson I didn\u2019t know you were visiting us\u201d, he greeted her slowly. Something was strange. She was not wearing her normal clothes, she was wearing his mother\u2019s. She was dressed in his mother\u2019s favourite green sundress and her black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson turned around, a bit surprised. \u201cWhat did you just call your mother?\u201d, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother? You are my neighbour, Mrs. Jefferson!\u201d, replied Ethan and then noticed the swapplet lying on the kitchen sink. He counted together one and one. \u201cYou took the swapplet from me this morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe swapplet?\u201d, asked Mrs. Jefferson confused but soon understood. \u201cOh, you mean this little thing here?\u201d. She grabbed the swapplet from the sink. \u201cYou call it swapplet, eh? Yeah, I took it from you this morning. I was really curious whether you two used it or not, but I guess my question is answered, considering that you were immune to the reality altering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how? Why?\u201d, asked Lilly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson smiled. \u201cMy dear Susan. I saw that thing crashing into your yard just like you two did. I also saw how you took it in. I was curious what it was, but I obviously could not ask you two directly, I doubted you would tell me the truth. I mean, it changed its form to a tablet as soon as Ethan touched it! I wanted to know what it was, and my chance came this morning. I didn\u2019t plan for it but when I saw the thing, this swapplet as you call it, ready for grabbing in your purse, I just couldn\u2019t resist it. Then there was this knowledge that flooded my head. Luckily for me, I was able to hide the thing from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains how you got\u201d, said Ethan. \u201cBut why are you dressed like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her gaze from Lilly to Ethan and smiled. \u201cBecause I hated my life. I live alone with a daughter that hates me, a job that I hate but must do to provide for me and said ungrateful daughter. God, I haven\u2019t met a guy who was not a complete asshole in years! Then there is Lilly with her perfect life. A husband who doesn\u2019t run away from her and her children. Children that love her. She even has my dream job! I always wanted to teach children but couldn\u2019t afford college. I was so jealous of her. But all of this has changed now. Now I have the loving family, the dream job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was speechless. He knew that she was not happy with her daughter, but it was much worse than he had expected. \u201cYou can\u2019t just steal my mother\u2019s life!\u201d, he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM your mother now\u201d, hissed Mrs. Jefferson. \u201cAnd I did not steal her life. That would have meant that I would have also gained Lilly\u2019s mother. I just can\u2019t stand that woman. No, I did a serious of swaps that allowed me to still have my own childhood and parents, but it was me who met Harold. It was me who he fell in love with. It was me in college. I also could keep my name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you still stole her life, doesn\u2019t matter if it was through a life swap or through multiple different swaps!\u201d, exclaimed Lilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson shrugged her shoulders. \u201cSo, what if I did? Lilly doesn\u2019t know any better. For her it was always like this. No harm done, right? Can\u2019t you see that I deserve this? After all I\u2019ve been through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took a step closer to Mrs. Jefferson. He previously wanted to try and grab the swapplet from her, forcing her to swap back, but he thought about what she said. He did not think that she \u201cdeserved\u201d the swaps, but there was really no harm in doing this. His mother really did not know that anything is wrong. Hell, Mrs. Jefferson thought that Lilly was with him when he found the swapplet. And he felt petty for her. Would it really be so bad to let her lead this life, at least for a while? How was this any different than what he and Lilly had done. Then again, it was unclear if she would swap back in the end.</span></div></div>",

I would be fine with you temporarily swapping with my mom, as a kind of vacation, but you make it sound like you want this to be permanent!\u201d, said Ethan and jumped forward, trying to get the swapplet from her. Unfortunately, Mrs. Jefferson predicted it and dodged his assault, making him crash against the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan\u2026\u201d, she sighed. \u201cI would have really wished that you could be my son\u2026 But you are not taking this away from me.\u201d. She began to type things in the swapplet. Not much that Ethan could do at that moment, he was hurting. Lilly on the other hand tried to be stealthier and grab the device while Mrs. Jefferson was occupied with the swapplet, sadly she came to late. Mrs. Jefferson finished what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was suddenly gone from Ethan, instead he heard someone shouting at him. He registered that the girl said something like \u201cI hate you mom\u201d. Then suddenly the screaming was gone. Ethan blinked confused, noticing that his clothes felt weird. And he was not in his kitchen anymore, he was in another kitchen. He looked around. It was Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s kitchen. He then noticed his clothes, they were the same she had worn this morning, namely a yellow t-shirt with a deep neckline, grey yoga pants and black flats. He then noticed another person in the room, while also noting that he was currently sitting at the kitchen table. The other person was Lilly who was wearing a torn top that made her bra slightly visible, torn jeans and black boots. He assumed these were Veronicas clothes, especially as he noticed that the short hair she got from him was now dyed pink. Lilly looked just as confused as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did that bitch do?!\u201d, Lilly cursed as she looked around, trying to orientate herself. She then looked out of the window where she could look into the kitchen of the neighbouring house, the one she had been in just a few moments ago. There she saw Ethan\u2019s mother and Veronica getting something to eat out of the fridge and talking to each other, wearing Ethan\u2019s and her clothes respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe swapped us with my mother and her daughter, so we don\u2019t get in her way\u201d, said Ethan and stood up. \u201cCome one let\u2019s get over there and fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door bell rang. Ethan and Lilly looked at each other and then proceeded to open the door, where they found Mrs. Jefferson waiting for them, a serious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon Andrea. And you too Veronica\u201d, she said coldly. \u201cI am sorry that it had come to this, but you didn\u2019t leave me any choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwap us back immediately!\u201d, screamed Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t. You want to take this away from me and I won\u2019t allow it. You two are lucky, I could have used the unaware option when I swapped you, but I didn\u2019t want to risk your \u2018doppelgangers\u2019 still remembering the device and continuing what you wanted to do. So, be glad that you still know who you are\u201d, she explained, her face staying cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away with this! We\u2019re going to get the swapplet back or we\u2019re going to go to the police\u201d, said Ethan, trying to keep his voice low to avoid anyone in the neighbourhood hearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson chuckled. \u201cYou can try, but I took measures to avoid this. First, I swapped all your memories of your home with the two in there. If you think hard enough, you will find out that you know every nook and cranny of the house you are currently standing in but only have superficial knowledge of MY house. In case you go to the police and you would find a way to convince the police that something like that exists, I swapped memories of your personal information. So, name, age, birthplace and such. I figured that you may be immune and might still remember some things about your old life if I did that, but any lie detector would probably detect you lying when you say your name is Ethan instead of Andrea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan clenched his fists in anger. She was right. If she had only swapped lives, people would refer to him as Andrea, but he would know that his name was Ethan, but this way? He knew that Andrea was not his real name, but it felt correct. When he thought of his birthday, the date 16th of July 1975 came to his mind, but that would make him 43 and not 17. No matter how hard he tried to remember, he could not come up with any other birthdate that belonged to him. \u201cI guess, it\u2019s because Mrs. Jefferson doesn\u2019t know my birthday\u201d, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grabbed Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s arm, he whole body shaking in anger. \u201cYou will give me the swapplet so I can change everything back or else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grabbed woman just laughed. \u201cOr else what? What do you want to do? I hid the swapplet in my house, granted it\u2019s not a good hiding place right now. I was in a hurry. Nonetheless, Susan and Ethan won\u2019t like it if you two come barging in and start searching everything in the house, and neither will I. I\u2019ll call the cops and then we will see who they\u2019ll believe. The intruders who claim to be the son and daughter of the house or the poor house owner who gets attacked by her crazy neighbour and daughter? Now would you be a dear and let go of me, Veronica? It\u2019s starting to hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly did as she was told, still being visibly angry. The older woman rubbed her arm but her cold expression changed to a smile. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not a horrible person. I hope that you\u2019ll understand me, maybe just a teeny tiny bit, if you must live like this for a while. I\u2019ll swap you back when I can be sure that you learnt your lesson. Until then.\u201d. The new Mrs. Harrison turned around and went back to her home, leaving Lilly and Ethan alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at Ethan, her expression turning from anger to desperation. \u201cWhat shall we do now, mom?\u201d, she asked. It took her a few moments before she noticed how she had called him, but it took Ethan even longer before he noticed it as well. \u201cShe even swapped that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded and sighed. \u201cYes, dear\u2026\u201d. He flinched as he noticed how he felt compelled to call her. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything right now, she is in a better position than the two of us right now. We\u2019d have to break in and find the swapplet before anyone notices us, if they call the police it would be over. We would be charged for home invasion, maybe even robbery. Given our current situation, I doubt we could find it in time. We have to play along for now and wait for our opportunity to strike. She will be careless one day, just like we were, and then we can strike.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201eThis sucks\u201c, sighed Lilly and fell down onto the couch. \u201cThis is even worse than before, not to mention more confusing. I don\u2019t even know what my real name is supposed to me! The only name I can think of is Veronica. I know that it is not my name, but I can\u2019t convince myself of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably because the real Veronica didn\u2019t know your name\u201d, explained Ethan and sat down beside her. \u201cWe only know what that person knew about themselves and the swapped person. So, I think that my name is Andrea, but I know that my name should really be the name of the person I\u2019ve been swapped with, who would be the neighbour son Ethan. Therefore, I know that my name should actually be Ethan. But, Mrs. Jefferson, actually my mother living Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s life\u2026\u201d Ethan stopped for a moment. He noticed that he could not think of his mother as his mother anymore. He knew that she should be, but when he thought of his mother, he saw an elderly lady with grey hair in front of him. He shook his head and cleared his throat. \u201cMrs. Jefferson did not know my birthday. I know that my birthday should be the one the neighbour boy has, but I can\u2019t know the date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed and looked at the ceiling. \u201cThis whole thing gets way too complicated\u2026 God, it\u2019s so awkward. I know that you are supposed to be my best friend, but when I look at you and think about you, I always think about you as my mother. This way we really can\u2019t expect any help. How could we convince someone of the truth when we can\u2019t even convince ourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkward silence fell. Like almost all day, the two were clueless of what to do. \u201cWe should just try to live these lives\u2026 For now\u2026\u201d, said Ethan finally to break the silence. \u201cWe\u2019ve been moping enough today. How about we see what\u2019s on TV right now?\u201d. Their interests haven\u2019t been swapped thankfully, so the search for a show both enjoyed watching was fairly easy. What was not so easy, was the evening. Neither of the two was a good cook and Ethan did not receive Andreas cooking skills. A short telephone call and 20 minutes wait time later, they had received pizza and averted their problem for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe really have to find a solution for this\u201d, said Ethan, his mouth full of pizza. \u201cAs cool as it might seem, I doubt it would be a healthy diet for us if we only live on pizza or other delivered food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shrugged. \u201cThen we should both try to cook something tomorrow. Together we might be able to produce something edible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening consisted of more TV and trying to ignore their situation. When it was time for bed, both went to their respective rooms, feeling disturbed how easy they navigated the house. Ethan sat down on his new bed. At least he knew that he never slept in it, even though his memories told him otherwise. \u201cGod, even that\u2026 She really swapped every knowledge of the house, including knowledge of specific items in the house\u201d, he thought and looked around the room. He remembered decorating it, he knew where every item was. He looked down at his clothes, the same damn clothes he had worn all day since the swap. He even remembered buying them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big sigh, he laid down on the bed and looked at the ceiling. Now that he was alone and had no TV to distract him, he felt the memory changes severely. His old life seemed distant and wrong, he knew that it had to be his, but it did not feel like it. The worst part was that he did not even know what part of his memories were truly his. Just like Lilly could not remember how she was formerly called, there were things that Mrs. Jefferson did not know about him. How could he know that this was really one of his original memories if he did not even know that it was swapped? It really scared him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lead to another thing that scared him, he had no idea about Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s work life. Sure, he knew that she worked as a secretary in Harold\u2019s company. \u201cDad\u2019s company\u201d, he corrected himself in his mind, trying to hold on to what he knew was right. She worked in another department than him, but that\u2019s all he knew. He had no idea where he would have to go after entering the building, no idea when he even has to be there or even what exactly his tasks were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly because she hasn\u2019t swapped something important like that!\u201d, he thought angrily. Rummaging through his memories, he fortunately found at least one solution of his problem. He stood up and went over to the wardrobe, opened it and found a calendar of the inside of the door. It had her work schedule marked on it, with the other important thing to know for him: He had three days of vacation left. \u201cHopefully enough time to sort things out\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then glanced through the wardrobe he just opened. It contained women clothing, fashionable ones, for a middle-aged woman that is. Nonetheless, there was women clothing and he was supposed to wear it. He even \u201cremembered\u201d putting every item in there, even buying them. Ethan felt a strange, but familiar feeling in his crotch and was surprised he would feel it after this disastrous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t make a swap concerning sexuality, so I guess it\u2019s only logical that I still have my own urges and favourites\u201d, he thought as his hand went over the dozens of dresses, blouses, skirts and other articles of clothing that filled the wardrobe. \u201cShe really has a lot of clothing, like most women, I guess. Well, you must try to look your best if you want to find a nice guy. Where did that thought come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arousal thankfully overwhelmed his doubts that creeped in with this thought and he continued to go through his clothing collection. He knew every item and where to find it. Thus, he also knew exactly what he was looking for and had a light blue, silk negligee in his hand. His nipples began to harden as his hands caressed the soft material. Turned on to the maximum and having forgotten every worry that plagued him just mere minutes ago, he had discarded his clothes and found himself wearing said item. He did not even stop to notice how easy it was for him to put off his clothes or put the negligee on or how natural it felt for him to wear it. He was bothered by something else however: He remembered wearing it to seduce men and having sex with them, thankfully neither remembering any of the man himself nor the sex, only the reason \u201che\u201d bought the item and the seducing posing \u201che\u201d did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, he suppressed these memories and began to concentrate on the important thing in that moment: The arousal he felt as he looked himself in the mirror, the negligee doing wonders highlighting his big breasts. With Lilly\u2019s hair, he could mistake himself for a woman, if he squinted hard enough. This thankfully confirmed one of his other hopes: He was still into woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily, he posed in front of the mirror, touching himself in all different places, getting even more aroused. His pussy began screaming for attention. Stopping his posing, he laid down on the bed and let his hand slide down to the wet hole he had between his legs. Moans escaped his mouths, he tried his best not to make too much noise, so Lilly did not find out what he was doing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought than began to wander to another item that was in the room. Normally he would not have considered using a dildo, but in his aroused state and the relaxation it gave him after this stressful day, he had pushed the plastic penis in his pussy before he had even comprehended what it meant. His moans becoming even louder as he furiously began pumping the dildo inside him. A familiar feeling soon came to be and in a lust explosion, followed by a loud, almost screamed, moan, he had reached his climax and was breathing heavily on the bed. No matter how many times he masturbated with Lilly\u2019s vagina, it always felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the other nights, he almost instantly fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan sat at his vanity table and was in the process of applying make-up to his face, a skill he had learned over the last 4 months, through the help of Lilly and lots of YouTube videos. It had been a hard time for both Lilly and him. There had not been a single opportunity to get the swapplet back. From espionage through the windows of their house over to the neighbour\u2019s house, the only thing they could find out was that she did not hide it near any windows and she had the device always with her. Unfortunately, she had the device always in her purse and used a zipper to make access to it harder for the \u201cmother and daughter duo\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing that was haunting the two over these last couple of months. It got increasingly harder to distinguish their memories from the ones they had acquired after the swap. Ethan began addressing himself as Andrea even in his mind and no matter what he did, he could not stop calling Lilly \u201cdear\u201d or \u201cVeronica\u201d. It got even so bad, that the two started to address the old Mrs. Jefferson as Lilly, she had inherited the Lilly\u2019s name after Lilly had swapped it with Ethan\u2019s mother prior, or Mrs. Harrison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his new life was just as horrible for him. When he had swapped genitals with Lilly, he had not envisioned for it to last this long, so he had to endure her period multiple times now. His new job was just as painful for him, at least in the beginning. He had no idea of what he had to do, and everyone expected of him what they would expect from a woman who worked there for years. Needless to say, he messed up quite a lot. Thankfully, he found an ally in the company. Another secretary by the name of Allison Morgan. She helped him out a lot and he learned the ropes of his job really fast thanks to her. Now it was just a nuisance for him and he understood why the real Mrs. Jefferson hated the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Lilly it was much easier getting accustomed to her new life, as Veronica was younger than her. Since she had already been through the classes Veronica had to take, she improved the teens grades a lot. She also broke up with Veronicas old friends and got new ones, making it even more easy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly was also the one who came up with a plan. After a month of leading their new lives, Lilly hatched the plan that the two should try and improve the life of Andrea Jefferson, as the old one was fairly dissatisfied with it. If they improved it enough, she might get jealous and wanted to swap back. She admitted that it might not be the best plan and it might lead to nothing, but what did they got to lose? That woman went crazy with the swapplet, any reasoning would be impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the last months the two had noticed more and more swapped people around the street and more \u201cswap improvements\u201d in the neighbour house. As if her new life was not enough, the current wielder of the swapplet had swapped her own body parts to improve her looks. She looked like 20 again, with now big D-Cups that rivalled the ones Ethan possessed. Combined with her juicy ass, her long, toned legs and her slim stomach, she looked more attractive than she probably had ever looked. Her improvements did not stop there however. Her husband got the same youthful treatment and even got a better paying job, which made it impossible for Ethan to get into the house via a work relationship with his former dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old Mrs. Jefferson did not stop with improvements though. If she found someone who bothered her too much, he would feel her wrath. Most of the times they were \u201charmless\u201d swaps but occasionally someone angered her enough that she had to show the punishment. Not to the world as she did not want to present the swapplet to the world and get in danger losing her power. The first who felt her wrath was Timmy Logan from across the street. The poor 7-year old boy had just been playing with his ball as she came by on the boardwalk, showing off her new fur coat that she bought after she swapped her husbands job the day prior. The ball flew through the air and landed in a mud puddle. The splashing mud unfortunately landed on the old Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s coat. Furiously, she began screaming at the boy and got the swapplet out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder, Ethan remembered how he had just gotten home from grocery shopping and had to witness how she menacingly put in inputs on the swapplet. When she was finished, the boy was dressed in his mother\u2019s clothes, who had hurried out of the house as she heard the screaming. The boy looked confused over his clothes while his mother was apologizing to her furious neighbour. Only the boy was made aware of the swap and only this one particular swap. When he tried to explain to his mother that he was wearing her clothes, her jewellery and even her underwear, she scolded him for trying to change the subject and forced him to apologize to the old Mrs. Jefferson. Ethan had no idea if the young boy put two and two together and concluded that the woman he knew as Mrs. Harrison was the cause of his change. The old Andrea also noticed her mistake and never punished someone on the spot again. Ethan felt bad for him as he knew how he must feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was also the day that Ethan and Lilly concluded two things: First, they both did not know that it was even possible to make a person aware of a particular swap when said person had never touched the device, meaning that they have not received all the knowledge about the swapplet and that a person gains more knowledge the longer it is used. Second, they knew for sure that their adversary has gone crazy with power and they had to be careful if they did not want to be thrown into even more miserable lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan just finished his make-up and looked at himself in the mirror. He was pleased with it, although he thought that because of his male face, he looked like a drag queen. \u201cNot like anyone would notice\u201d, he thought and straightened his tight, sequined, blue dress. He hated to doll himself up, but it was necessary for his plan to improve Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile improving the mother-daughter relationship was fairly easy, since his daughter was Lilly and the two liked each other by default, the job and the husband were fairly hard tasks. Ethan took distance learning classes to get the necessary degree for Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s dream job. This limited his free time immensely and he really hoped that she would be jealous way sooner than when he finished. The husband thing was another kind of difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson had been fairly active in the dating scene before which rather limited the number of suitable candidates, not to mention that Ethan still had his own sexuality and the thought of being with a man mad him gag. He had formulated excuse after excuse of why he could not start dating at that moment to Lilly. A month ago, his reservoir of excused had dried up and they found an interested suitor quickly, with the help of Ethan\u2019s new best friend Allison. Her sister\u2019s husband\u2019s friend Greg just went through a divorce and introduced the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks ago, they went on their first date in a quite expensive restaurant. Ethan had been quite nervous as he never had gone on a date and had minimal experience with it through TV, not to mention he never thought that his first date would be as a woman. He read every dating guide he could find beforehand. In the end, all of that was not necessary as the two just got along. Ethan of course never seeing anything sexual in him and just viewed him as a nice guy, but he tried his best to make it seem like he wanted more from him. On their second date, they went ice skating in the park, as it was finally cold enough for it, now that the Christmas season was approaching. Normally, Ethan was really good at ice skating, being no professional but he was able to do some impressive figures.  With his changed body and clothes though, he found that he would have train a bit until he would be able to do this again. Greg seemed to enjoy having to prevent Ethan from falling and in moment where the two were in the centre of the lake and the moon was shining down on the two, they kissed. Ethan suppressed his urge to puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was their third date. Ethan was a bit nervous as he knew, again from television shows, what usually went down on the third date. Not to mention that he had to hurry home to get ready, as he and Greg had to meet up on a Friday this time, because Ethan\u2019s company held their Christmas party this Saturday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs if that bitch Janice knew she would get at me when she puts the party on Saturday\u201d, he thought. Between learning, cleaning the house and his work, he only ever had enough free time on Saturday for dating. Putting on matching blue pumps he was finally ready to go down, where Greg was already waiting for him, Lilly keeping him company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath in, his impressive bust going up and down as a consequence, he went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Greg\u201d, he said as he came down the stairs and could see him sitting on the couch beside Lilly. The man turned his head around and a big smile appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that the waiting was worth it. You\u2019re looking incredible, Andrea\u201d, he complimented him as he stood up to go over to him. Ethan looked embarrassed to his side. He was still uncomfortable when he received compliments regarding his feminine look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg put on his own coat and helped Ethan put on his. \u201cShall we then?\u201d, he asked as he opened the door. Ethan nodded, grabbed his purse that hung underneath where the coat hung and followed him outside to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun, mom\u201d, grinned Lilly, but soon her face turned sad. She did not like that Ethan went out with somebody else, even when it was a man and just a charade for their plan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The city was passing by the car window Ethan was looking out through. Greg was telling him about his day as head of legal department and Ethan was only half-heartedly listening to him. Ethan never was interested in law and his date did not awoke any interest in him. He was still surprised that Greg would even be interested in a mere secretary, given his position and salary. \"Then again, after his divorce he\u2019s probably looking for something easier to manage\", he thought. Not that Ethan minded though, if he could successfully seduce Greg, it would greatly benefit his and Lilly\u2019s plan. The guilt that he basically tried to trick a man in a relationship weight heavy on him, but what choice did he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were waiting at a traffic light, Ethan saw Kurt Jameson, the junior jock from his old school. At least it was his head. Lilly had told him that after another bullying act against Ethan and Lilly, he had incurred the old Mrs. Jefferson\u2019s anger and was swapped with the sluttiest cheerleader on the squad, Amber Nicholson. She had not stopped there, he also gained her position on the cheerleader squad. The bad karma he had accumulated over the years was paying off as well and he found out that Amber, and by extend now he, was pregnant. Most everyone in school estimated that he should be 5 months pregnant, but only Kurt really knew. Like the neighbour boy, he was left aware of his swap, but the old Mrs. Jefferson was more careful that time and did not show herself that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time that Ethan saw his old tormentor in his swapped state, his stomach now slightly bulging out the dark blue sweater he wore. Kurt was apparently on a shopping tour with his mother, indicated by the bags the older woman had. Ethan had no idea if it was stuff for the baby, maternity wear or stuff for Kurt\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger was building up inside Ethan. Yes, he hated Kurt, even now that his school life seemed like a distant life, but he certainly did not deserve this. He clenched his fist in anger, only to stretch his fingers quickly as he rammed his long fingernails in his palm. The car started moving again and got Ethan away from the poor Kurt. \"Don\u2019t worry, Kurt. When I get the swapplet back, I\u2019ll swap everything back. Luckily there is a reset function\", thought Ethan as he breathed in and out to reduce his anger and concentrate again on his mission. Greg luckily had not noticed Ethan\u2019s anger and drove them to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped in front of an expensive looking French restaurant. Greg got out of the car and walked to the other side to help Ethan out of the car. The cold air caressed his cheeks and his legs, that the coat did not cover, being slightly glad that he wore pantyhose for slight protection against the cold. Greg closed the door and gave his keys to the valet. He then led Ethan inside and both followed the waiter to their table, while also getting rid of their coats in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s lovely here\", said Ethan as he looked around the restaurant. The lights were dimmed to create a romantic atmosphere. Every table had a candle on it for the same reason. A band playing soothing music in the background. He had never been to such an expensive place in his life, even the restaurant they have been on their first date was way simpler and cheaper. \"He really goes all out on this one\", thought Ethan as they arrived on their table and Greg helped him to sit down, which he really appreciated given that his tight dress made that feat quite difficult. \"Which means that I\u2019m not the only one who thinks there will be more going down tonight.\" That thought of course still sending a chill down Ethan\u2019s spine. He would not only lose his virginity to some random guy and not Lilly like he had hoped countless nights, no he would also lose it with Lilly\u2019s vagina, which would technically mean she would lose her virginity without even having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had of course talked about this extensively and Ethan knew that Lilly was not comfortable with that, but they had no choice. Either this or trying to steal the swapplet out of the Harrison house and risking jail, and never being able to swap back consequently, in the process. They both agreed that it had to be done for their greater good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took the menu with his manicured hands and looked through it. Most dishes were named in french, which meant that he did not understand what he would eat. He closed it and smiled at Greg. \"You know what? I never ate in such a wonderful place and am probably not as well versed with the french kitchen as you are. Just recommend me something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", returned Greg the smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo\u201d, began Greg after telling the waiter the order. \u201cI think I\u2019ve talked enough of my day, how about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at the man he was currently dating, the dim light of the candles giving him a romantic aura. Greg was quite attractive for a man of his age and the light definitely did wonders hiding the faint signs of aging. He stretched his hand over the table towards Ethan, who replied the gesture by resting his own hand on Greg\u2019s. While Ethan\u2019s hand was just average sized, it was painfully obvious that it belonged to a teenage boy and not a woman, even the long fingernails, that he had painted in a seducing red, could not hide the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was quite busy\u201d, curled Ethan his red painted lips to a smile. \u201cAnd I really appreciate that we could arrange to meet today. The company had to schedule the Christmas party tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg returned the smile. \u201cYou always are so busy, that\u2019s something I admire about you. How are you able to do all this? I mean, caring for your daughter, doing your job, studying at night for a degree for your dream job and then you still got the time to meet me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly? The trick is having a motivator, a good motivator. You\u2019d be surprised to what lengths you can go with the right motivation\u201d, answered Ethan truthfully, while maintaining his smile, and thought about his own motivator that lead him to this whole ordeal. In order to get his life back, he was prepared to sacrifice his best friends\u2019 virginity, probably his own, depending on how you look at it, and his sanity. Like Greg said, he was always so busy, and it was really draining his energy. Thankfully Lilly helped in the daughter department as well as around the house, it was her life the two were trying to get back as well, but even with that Ethan could not remember a day where he could just sit back and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d, asked Greg. \u201cMind telling me what that motivator might be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see\u2026\u201d, began Ethan, biding for time to think of a lie he could tell him. Greg would never believe such a thing as \u2018swapping peoples lives and such\u2019. \u201cAfter my husband disappeared, I was in a deep hole. My daughter blamed me for his disappearance and maybe she was right. I wasn\u2019t a good person back then. At first, I thought I couldn't do anything about it and just accepted my life, being stuck in a job I don't like and having a daughter that hated me. Even my love life was horrible, no wonder since you normally don't attract the nicest of men when you think you are not worth anything. But one day, I caught my daughter with drugs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan paused for a second and tried to pretend as if he was trying his best not to begin crying. So far, he had told the truth, as far as he knew. He had no idea if Mrs. Jefferson really felt that way about her life, he could only imagine giving the actions she took to get away from it. Only the drug part was a complete lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d, he apologized and closed his eyes, took a deep breath and continued. \u201cShe told me that it didn\u2019t matter what she did. Life is meaningless and such. That was the moment I realized what a bad role model I had been and that I had to change something. I talked to her, for the first time I really talked to her and we settled our differences. I then decided to not only show her that she doesn\u2019t have live a miserable life because that\u2019s all there is, I also wanted to show me that I could get a happy life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s face got a sad for a moment and he looked down on the table. He then looked up again and into Greg\u2019s eyes, his face returning to the smiling expression from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t want to dampen the mood\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head and gabbed Ethan\u2019s hand. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m thankful that you told me all that. I can only imagine how hard it must have been for you. That makes it even more impressing that you were able to find the motivation to do all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at his hand that Greg was holding and then back in Greg\u2019s face. A part of him felt really bad for using Greg in his scheme to make the real Mrs. Jefferson jealous. Greg was a nice dude and deserved a nice, loving woman. But what choice did he have? In order to get his life back, someone had to be hurt and who knew? Maybe it all works out in the end for all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so nice\u201d, said Ethan and tried to look embarrassed. \u201cI am so glad to have met you. I instantly felt a connection when we two met.\u201d He hoped that this was not too much and would push Greg away, even with all the research he had done, Ethan still was a beginner when it came to dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg\u2019s smile did not disappear. \u201cYeah, I felt that, too. To be honest, I never met a woman like you. There is just something, I don\u2019t know. You seem to be so youthful at times, like you preserved your teenage years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot very hard, when you were in your teenage years only four months ago\u201d, commented Ethan in his mind and looked into Greg\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes you even seem so different than all the other women. I don\u2019t know how to describe it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get what you mean\u201d, smiled Ethan. \u201cI feel the same way. I\u2019ve dated many different men after I was single again, but I never found someone quite like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dinner is ready\u201d, interrupted the waiter this intimate moment, much to Ethan\u2019s dismay. It was going so well. A look in the face of the waiter told him that he felt sorry, but had to serve the dinner either way. Greg let go of Ethan\u2019s hand and thanked him, a bit irritated because of the sudden interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at what Greg had ordered, some meal of which he could never possibly pronounce the name correctly. He carefully used his fork and ate a bit, noticing that it did not kill him and did not even taste so bad. Greg began eating as well and an awkward silence had laid itself over the table. Ethan was not sure if he had been too direct, if Greg was embarrassed for what he said, both or it was maybe something completely different. Ethan wanted to break the silence, but he was too troubled trying to eat properly. Like many other things recently, he had no idea what the proper etiquette for dining in a French restaurant was, not to mention he had even less experience with any other restaurant apart from fast food restaurants, so he educated himself through YouTube videos and other media. He knew many things to look out for, but he still had to concentrate and think of all the different little things he had to look out for, especially some unladylike behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re liking it?\u201d, asked Greg finally to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded slowly. \u201cYeah, I never ate something like that, and the whine is really delicious by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear. I must admit that I was a bit nervous coming here. To be honest, it has been a really long time since I was eating French. When you told me to choose for your, I almost panicked. I had no idea what tasted good and what not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Then why did you choose to come here?\u201d, asked Ethan surprised and put the glass whine down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo impress you\u201d, he answered truthfully. \u201cLike I said, there is just something special about you. And truth be told, after my own divorce I felt rather awkward dating again. You can probably understand, right? After all these years in a relationship, being back on the market. It\u2019s not that easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded, he had no idea what it really was like, but he got an idea after living his new life for a while. He took Greg\u2019s hand again, looked deeply into his eyes and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you. Your ex-wife must be crazy to have let you go\u201d, he said calmly, not breaking eye contact. \u201cAnd I appreciate your honesty. Most guys wouldn\u2019t tell something like that in fear that they sound weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan then began rubbing his high heeled foot against Greg's legs in front of him, trying to advance the sexual tension they began feeling. \"But I think it takes more strength to be honest and admit your own weaknesses\", he purred and began twirling his hair, while looking at him lovingly. He hoped he did not look as silly as he felt doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg blushed slightly but recovered fast. He smiled coyly at his date. The two broke apart and continued their meal, but not without exchanging lustful glances or complimenting each other. Ethan noticed how easier it became for him to slip in the flirty persona he had tried to acquire for the last couple of weeks. Maybe it was the whine or maybe he just felt more at ease with his basically female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two found themselves on the way home. Greg did not drink much whine and therefore drove Ethan back home. The boy turned woman on the other hand was quite drunk already and barely remembered the next step in the seduction plan he and Lilly had come up with. He looked over to Greg's crotch and his hand trembled. As much as he had tried to tell himself that this was necessary and he had to do this, he was still disgusted by the thought of touching another men's penis, not even the alcohol was helping him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unsure whether it was the alcohol that was driving him to this or if he really wanted to do this, Ethan managed to fight back every compulsion he had and wrapped his lipstick painted lips around the still dormant lying member of his date. Not knowing what he should really do, it was his first blow-job after all and he only had vague memories of his time with a penis of his own, he slowly began sucking at it. He could feel it becoming harder rather quickly and pleasured sounds came from above. Greg seemed to enjoy it. Ethan tried different things that came to his mind, like using his tongue, varying his sucking speed and so on, hoping that Greg would enjoy it. The answer came quick and Ethan gagged as something liquid was thrusted into his mouth, followed by deep moans from Greg. Ethan let go of Greg and got back to his normal position, wiping his mouth during the motion. He shyly looked over to Greg to see if he wanted to say something, but he just smiled at Ethan and continued driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not long before they arrived at Ethan's house, not the one he had lived for 17 years, but the one that belonged to him for the last months. Not that Ethan could remember ever living next doors, but he told himself that what he thought was his house was not really his house every time he got home, just to remind himself of his mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg helped Ethan out of the car and to the front door. The alcohol still made it hard for Ethan to walk in his heels. When they arrived the door, he was rummaging through his purse to get his keys out. When he did, Greg was smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight was wonderful\", he said to Ethan and gazed into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to end now\", purred Ethan and gave Greg a passionate kiss that Greg of course replied. Ethan soon found Greg's hands exploring his backside and he was busy fumbling with his keys while lustfully asking for more with his kisses. After what felt like an eternity, he finally opened the door blindly and both stormed in and into Ethan's bedroom, breaking their hot embrace only for the stairs to avoid an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Greg threw Ethan on the bed, Ethan's shoes landing on the floor in the process, and was more moments over him, continuing his loving making. Now he slowly moved down Ethan's neck, planting plenty of kisses on it, which gave Ethan goose bumps. The boy-turned-middle-aged-woman moaned slightly with every touch of Greg's rough lips and began undressing his partner. Soon he could see Greg's upper body in all its glory. No six-pack to be seen, not that surprising, but there was no fat either. Ethan ran his manicured hand down Greg's stomach, down to Greg's pants, just as Greg arrived at Ethan's big, round breasts. Being half naked already, he helped Ethan out of his tight dress before they would continue, revealing his black, lacy bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful, Andrea\", whispered Greg into Ethan's ear and opened the bra, then beginning to suck on Ethan's nipples. A new feeling was rushing through Ethan's body. He had tweaked his nipples during his time alone, but it felt so different from what he was experiencing now. Loud moans escaped Ethan's mouth and he closed his eyes in pleasure. While playing with Ethan's nipples with his tongue, Greg got rid of Ethan's panties, revealing the smooth, shaven teenage vagina between Ethan's legs. As his mouth was still busy with the breasts, his hands went down and first brushed carefully over the hole before beginning to play with the lips. The feeling Ethan got this time was quite familiar, there was not much difference between being touched by someone else or his own hands down there, although he found Greg's touch much better. Ethan's moans intensified, and he felt himself becoming wet. With trembling hands, Ethan put his hands on Greg's belt and tried to open it. The alcohol however made this task very difficult for him.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\"Wait let me help you\", whispered Greg, let go of Ethan and stood up to get out of his pants and underpants. Ethan gulped when he saw Greg's member standing at full attention. Sooner in the dark of the car it was impossible for him to get a good look at it, but now, even in the dim light of the bedroom, he could see it in all its glory. It was also in this moment Ethan realized again what the two were doing and was shocked how easy the whole thing up to this point felt for him. Has it been the alcohol or was it the fact that he led a women's life for months now, along with having an anatomical female body? Either way, Ethan looked hesitantly at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong? Is it going to fast?\", asked Greg carefully, having noticed Ethan's expression. A few moments passed before Ethan shook his head and smiled seductively at Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Everything's alright. It just has been a while since I did this. I'm a bit rusty, I guess\", lied Ethan and motioned Greg to come over with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg did as he was told, after putting on a condom, and get back to Ethan. After a bit of teasing, where he was rubbing his hard member alongside Ethan's smooth lips, he entered him. Ethan almost screamed in pain. While everyone though he was a mother, his vagina was still that of a virgin, or has been now. Greg did not notice anything though and began pumping vigorously. Soon the pain faded away and was replaced by a pleasurable feeling. Ethan relaxed himself and enjoyed what Greg was doing to him. Hesitantly he began moving his hips, so Greg could enter even deeper into him. The soft moans Ethan emitted turned into louder and louder screams of pleasure, which on the other hand motivated Greg to thrust harder and harder, grunting loud in the process. Then finally, a huge wave washed in over Ethan, his toes curled and his whole body went stiff, as he reached his climax just as Greg did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Greg rolled over besides Ethan. Just as out of breath, Ethan turned around and put an arm over Greg's naked body. Both were too exhausted to speak and soon drifted into a deep slumber.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan awoke due to a combination of two things. First, a small ray of sunlight was shining onto his face. Second, he heard a loud snoring noise just above his head. As he started to wake up, he also noticed another thing: His head felt like a train derailed right onto it. He opened his eyes, saw that his arm was placed around a broad chest. He carefully looked up to see where the snoring voice came from and saw Greg's face, sleeping peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\u2026 We did it yesterday\u2026\", he thought and carefully and quietly got up. He did not want to wake Greg up. Not being in the mood to look for his underwear right now, he grabbed the pink, silky bathrobe he had on the backside of his door and left the room. He quietly went downstairs to bring enough room between him and Greg to not wake him up. Rubbing his temple, he went to the kitchen and hoped that drinking something or an aspirin would help his hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, mom\", greeted a voice Ethan as soon as he entered the kitchen, which caused him to startle due to surprise, but also made him grab his head again. \"I heard you had a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, dear\u2026\", mumbled Ethan and went over to the kitchen cupboard to get a glass. \"Could you tone it down a bit? I think I drank too much yesterday\u2026\" He grabbed a glass and filled it with water, then looked for an aspirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. But I guess it worked as planned?\", asked Lilly, with regret in her voice. She knew that it had to be done but this did not make it any more easier. Ethan lost HER virginity. If it had been to her, she would have been fine with it, considering she would lose his in the process, but like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water in Ethan's glass vanished just as fast as he had poured it in after he added the aspirin. \"Yeah\", he nodded. \"It was a wonderful evening and\u2026 I guess you heard us, right?\". Ethan immediately blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wouldn't?\", smiled Lilly and brushed her hand through her hair, which was back to Ethan's natural blond hair colour but had lengthened over the course of the last months. \"Mrs. Harrison probably heard you as well, which would be beneficial of course.\". She of course referred to the old Mrs. Jefferson who was occupying the life of Ethan's former mother and now neighbour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope she did\u2026 Let's hope she get's envious\u2026\", he said, but not as confident as he was last night. He had enjoyed last night, everything that happened last night. Sure, he could tell himself that it was the alcohol, but he was not so sure about this. \"Veronica\u2026 Let's suppose our plan won't work\u2026 Would it really be that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly blinked surprised. \"What? Of course, it would be bad. We would be stuck like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\u2026 But\u2026 I don't know\u2026 It's getting increasingly harder to not think of this here as my life\u2026 And as difficult as it is\u2026 I\u2026 I really enjoy this. I enjoyed yesterday\u2026 I enjoy my job\", he said to her and sat down at the kitchen table, clasping the glass in his hands. \"Maybe\u2026 Maybe we should stay like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?! What about your family?! Your life?!\", exclaimed Lilly, but tried to be as quiet as possible to not cause too much pain to poor Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My life? My family? I barely remember it, Veronica! Every time I think of my family, I think of you and your grandparents. I hardly know how it feels to be a teenage boy anymore\", he replied. \"You probably feel the same, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly opened her mouth, wanting to argue against him, but she stayed quiet. \"No\u2026 I guess you're right\u2026 I know how you feel, I feel the same way. My life is not that different from how it was supposed to be, which makes it even more difficult to distinguish it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stayed silent for a while. \"I think we have to follow our plan either way, mom\", said Lilly finally. \"Even if we want to stay like this and I'm not sure if I want when I have the swapplet back in my hand\u2026 But as long as Mrs. Harrison has it, nobody is safe. Most people she had swapped out of spite or revenge are thankfully unaware, but not everyone is so lucky. Just look at poor Timmy Logan\u2026 The boy has no idea what happened and is suddenly forced to wear his mother's clothes or poor Kurt. He did not deserve what she has done to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, dear\", agreed Ethan. \"We have to get the device back. Then we can think about our situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked down at the table for a moment, then back up again. \"So\u2026 How was it, mom?\", grinned Lilly. \"You have to tell me everything. Every little detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled and began to tell her everything. He was a bit hesitant at first, but who else had he to talk to? Sure, he could talk to Allison, but he could not be as genuine in every aspect as he could be with Lilly. He also enjoyed the long talks with her, because it was the one thing both sides of him yearned for: The Ethan side wanted to be with Lilly, while the Andrea side wanted to be with her daughter and while the Ethan side got weaker and weaker with each passing day, he enjoyed the small moments where everything felt like it should be. Just him and Lilly. Talking. Just in time, Ethan had finished his story, when they heard steps coming from upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your lover boy is awake\", grinned Lilly, which made Ethan involuntarily blush. Moments later, Greg, dressed again in the clothes he had worn the day before, entered the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. Last night was\u2026\", he began greeting Ethan before he noticed Lilly and stopped. Ethan and Lilly could tell that he was at unease, not fully knowing what he should say now that Lilly was here. Ethan jumped up from his seat and went over to him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was wonderful\", smiled Ethan and planted a kiss on Greg's lips. \"Don't worry. I've told her everything and she is fine with it. She's thankfully not one of those teenagers who get angry when her mother is sleeping with another men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm also not the kind of teenager who enjoys hearing her mother talk with said men about sex, MOM\", replied Lilly and went past Greg. \"I'm in my room.\" She of course wanted to give the two some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked thankful after Lilly before turning his attention back at Ethan. \"Yeah, like you said, last night was wonderful. I'd really like to repeat it\", he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan returned the smile, again blushing slightly. \"I'd love to\", he purred and caressed Greg's chest with a finger. \"Maybe we should go back up and\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd love to, I have to get to work\", he declined and kissed Ethan's forehead. \"But another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled. \"It's fine. You want some breakfast? I can prepare something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Greg shook his head. \"Thank you, but I have to hurry. I'll call you.\" He gave Ethan a lengthy kiss and then went out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god! I seriously don't know what I would have done if I had have to hear you without pressing my pillow against my ears!\", came a voice half-jokingly from upstairs when Greg was out of hearing range.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After breakfast it was time for Ethan to get some housework done. Lilly had already helped a lot in this regard and he really appreciated, but they shared their household duties. The happy hum still on his lips, he began with laundry, as he could vacuum while the washing machine was doing its thing. Ethan was surprised how much easier and less tiresome the housework suddenly was. He figured it had something to do with his impeccable mood. Today was a good day and not even Janice and the sales perverts could worsen his mood today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost the whole morning and the early after noon consisted of his housework. Due to his mood, Ethan was motivated enough to do even more than usual, resulting in him having some free time the next day, which he probably would have to use for studying, so basically no free time. It also meant that he worked longer than anticipated, thus he had to hurry up getting ready for the Christmas party. He quickly showered, careful not to get his hair wet, and then laid the red, wool dress he wanted to wear to the party, on his bed. He had thought about wearing a Christmas dress but decided against it, not wanting to draw too much attention, especially since many he found were more on the slutty side and for younger women. A few months ago, he would have shuddered when he noticed that he thought of himself as an older woman, but with time it became progressively harder to think of himself as a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing some pantyhose with a snowflake pattern, he had to go with the Christmas theme a tiny bit, he expertly rolled them up over his still manly, but shaved legs. With a chuckle he thought about how he would have been turned on by wearing this pantyhose, at least if the sliver of memories of his old life were correct, which he was not completely sure anymore, but now he wore them out of necessity. He had quickly discovered that dresses, especially during this cold season, were too chill and had quickly opted to wearing thicker pantyhose or avoid dresses, which he had grown to love during the warmer months. \"But I can't show up in slacks, could I? It would not be appropriate\", he thought as he slipped the warm, woolly dress over his body. It was less tight as the one he had worn yesterday, but it still showed off his curves, if you could call having breasts on a teenage boy's body curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then time for him to do his make-up and fix his hair, which he did not bother as much as he did yesterday. He had to look presentable, sure, but it would just be a boring party at the office where he probably would hang out with Allison. No need to get all dolled up. While he applied the various cosmetics to his face, his mind began slipping to last night. His night with Greg. Never had he felt this good and had this much fun. Yeah, hanging out with Lilly or Keith had been fun, as far as he remembered, but with Greg it was different. Not only the obvious difference called sex, but the whole night in general. It was a different kind of enjoyment than he had experienced before, and he wanted it to continue. This of course let him back to his concerns he had mentioned to Lilly this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really want to go back to a life that vanishes from my mind with each passing day? How long has it been since I truly thought that I should be a teenage boy and not a middle-aged woman?\", he thought as he pressed his lips together to apply red lipstick. \"What awaits me back in my life? A friendship I wished that was more than just that. Heck, I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do after school and now I'm trying to become a teacher, which I surprisingly enjoy. But would I enjoy it when I lose all my memories? My memories of this life\u2026 It's really hard to think of these memories as not my own anymore\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan let out a big sigh and looked at himself in the mirror. He had only applied light make-up and styled his hair in a bun. Nothing too fancy but that was not his goal anyway. \"But then there is Veronica\u2026 I mean Lilly. She probably wants to get back to her own life and as her mother, I mean best friend, I should be doing everything in my power to help her\", he thought and got up. A quick glance at the clock told him that he had to hurry up a bit when he did not want to be late. Slipping his feet in the black pumps he usually wore to work and grabbing a small purse that had some of his other belongings inside, he went downstairs where he found Lilly watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweety\", he greeted her which caused her to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom. Looking good\", smiled Lilly and then looked back at the TV. \"Don't worry about me, I'll survive the night. Just have fun tonight, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed. \"As if I could have fun at that boring party. Mr. Harrison will probably give one long ass speech about how the year went, most men will get drunk and annoy half the woman in the room, the other half will be just as drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could have invited Greg\", suggested Lilly without looking up from the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't have felt right\u2026 Well, either way, I'll try to survive, and you try to not trash the house, kay?\". With that Ethan left the house and drove away to the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's way to the office was as dull and uneventful as every other day, the only difference being the absence of the rush hour. \"I certainly could get used to this\", he thought with a smile on his face as he thought back to Greg and last night. As much as he tried, he was not capable of not thinking about it. Ethan figured that this was probably due to him really falling in love with Greg. A loud gasped escaped Ethan's mouth, due to him spacing out and almost running over a red traffic light, but also because of the realization. \"Yes\u2026 I really AM falling in love\", he whispered with a smile. A few months ago, he would have been horrified, but now? Now he was happy about that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the company parking lot, much sooner than he was used to, Ethan left his car with a smile on his face. While he still was not in the mood for the boring Christmas party, he certainly did enjoy himself right now. Grabbing his purse from the passenger's seat, he began making the ascent to the floor where the party was being held, his heels click-clack following his every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped out of the elevator, Ethan was immediately greeted by the smell of cinnamon, a pine tree as well as a faint smell of alcohol. The office had been heavily decorated, and Janice and her committee even arranged to get a real tree. \"Janice probably went over budget with this. Especially considering this big buffet\", he thought as he slowly made his way over to it. \"Not my problem though. She'll probably show her boobs to Jameson or whatever she does when she gets in trouble and be off the hook immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed something to eat when a voice greeted him from behind. Turning around he saw the person he had just thought about. Janice McCauthfield was a woman in her mid-thirties and had shoulder length, brown hair, which she usually had in a bun to look professional. Something that Ethan never understood. Janice tried to look professional but then she showed off her fake breasts by unbuttoning as many buttons on her blouses as possible. To this day Ethan was surprised that her skirts were a modest length, ending right above her knees. Today though, Janice was going all out and wore a red and white Christmas dress that was just long enough in all areas to be considered clothing instead of lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea! I love your dress\", smiled Janice with her bleached teeth and went on to give Ethan a kiss on both cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Janice. I also love your dress. It's really\u2026 thought provoking\", Ethan returned the smile and the kisses. He hated to do this, but Janice was the secretary of the CEO and had him under her spell. It was an open secret that he cheated on his wife with Janice and did her every bidding. Since she was not able to bask herself in his wealth, she tried to get her benefits from sleeping with him by basically controlling the company. If she disliked someone, you could be sure that said person would be demoted or fired as soon as possible. \"And you did a really good job with decorating the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thanks\", smiled Janice with an obvious fake smile. \"Enjoy yourself.\" She disappeared as quick as she had appeared, seemingly only wanting to say hello out of courtesy. Not that Ethan complained, he hated her like every other woman in the company and the less he had to interact with her the less chances he would get to get on her bad side. He wanted to escape this job, but he was depending on it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room he soon spotted his only friend and ally in the company: Allison Morgan. She was the one who introduced Ethan to Greg and is Ethan's best friend right now. Before Ethan had taken over Andrea Jefferson's life, Allison and Andrea barely knew each other but when Ethan needed help, she was there, and a friendship blossomed out of it. Ethan had no idea what he would have done without her. He probably would be a wreck by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there\", smiled Ethan as he approached the overweight woman with short, black hair. She was just as old as Andrea Jefferson, and therefore Ethan now, was, had two kids and was married. She currently wore a black dress with a matching small jacket, as well as a pearl necklace. Allison greeted Ethan back happily and the two began to talk about Ethan's date with Greg.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Christmas party had been as uneventful as Ethan had predicted. He talked with Allison, catching up about some things, gossiping about stuff that happened around the office. Same things he usually did with Allison. She, of course, questioned him about everything that had happened on Ethan's and Greg's date night. After a rather embarrassing accident involving Nick Jones and a falling Christmas tree, Ethan decided it was best to call it a night early, before the rest of the idiots he usually worked with got drunk even more. Thanks to the memories of Andrea that began surfacing more and more, as well as Allison, he knew that most guys got drunk way too hard during these Christmas parties and created enough work for the whole month of January for HR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped outside the building, Ethan immediately noticed how chill it had become and was glad that he decided to wear thicker pantyhose. It was still cold though and so he click-clacked as fast as he could to his car, threw his purse on the passenger seat and drove back home. It was still early, and he thought about surprise visiting Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe he would think I would be too clingy or something\", he thought and bit on his lip, waging his options. \"I can't mess this up. Better call him tomorrow or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uneventful night through the dark, lonely and thankfully, given how cold it had become, snow-free streets, Ethan arrived home and parked his car in the garage. He saw dim light coming from Veronica's room and could hear music playing as he entered the house through the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl probably didn't even hear me coming\", he thought and shook his head, while simultaneously kicking off his pumps and getting rid of his purse. \"But I'm early anyway.\" Ethan glanced over to the various books and paperwork he had to do for his classes. \"I better use the opportunity and get some work done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan grabbed his stuff and brought it over to the kitchen table which soon disappeared beneath the mountain of paper. \"Although I really wanted to rest during the holidays\", he sighed and looked at the part he hated about his life right now. At first, he only did it because he wanted to get the real Mrs. Jefferson jealous, but now he really wanted to get this degree himself. Maybe it was Andrea's memories and likings bleeding into him, maybe he really enjoyed it. \"But enjoying doesn't make this any more tedious\", he thought as he looked at this unsurmountable pile of work that was before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet in the kitchen, except for the sound of music coming out of Veronica's room. Ethan found his thoughts soon drifting away from teaching children and back to Greg. \"I really am hopelessly fallen in love with him\", he concluded with a smile as the last night was playing back in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thoughts was derailed by the music suddenly getting louder, followed by footsteps. \"She probably comes down to get something to\u2026\", thought Ethan before stopping as he noticed that the sound of footsteps came to fast, as if Lilly was stomping on the ground constantly. Curiosity began to rise within Ethan and he quickly but quietly turned off the light in the kitchen. The footsteps became louder and louder as they reached the stairs. The lights in the entrance went on and Ethan quickly hid behind a wall from which he could peek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly opened the door and motioned a black-haired guy outside. \"I'm sorry\", he could hear her say. \"I really enjoyed tonight, but you got to go now. My mom will be back soon, and I don't want her to know about us just yet.\" She then proceeded to kiss him and closed the door, immediately leaning against it and smiled broadly, like any teenage girl in love would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want your mother to find out, eh?\", grinned Ethan broadly at Lilly as he came out of his hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Lilly looked up to Ethan. \"Mo-MOM!\", she shrieked surprised. \"You're-You're home! I didn't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan slowly went over to Lilly, his big grin not fading from his face. \"Yeah, I decided to bail early and given how loud your music was, I'm not surprised you didn't hear me. More importantly though, who was that handsome lad you don't want your mother to know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed, looked over to the cramped full kitchen table and then went to the couch in the living room. \u201cI think we gotta talk, mom\", she began and patted beside her on the couch. Ethan did as he was told while Lilly continued. \u201cI don't know where to begin\u201d, she sighed and looked at her feet. \u201cI know how hard it must be for you. Living a middle-aged woman's life. Working, studying, taking care around the house. You even slept with a man just to get your old life back! I... I just felt guilty, you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuilty?\u201d, asked a confused Ethan. It was not her fault that they were stuck like this. He had not told her about it, but he enjoyed his life right now. Except the learning stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuilty...\u201d, she repeated. \u201cBecause I... I kind of enjoy my life right now. My life change wasn't as dramatic as yours. I basically repeat classes; therefore I have more time for other things. I found that I enjoy the company of Veronica's friends and, probably a side effect from Veronica's memories bleeding into me, I found it continuingly harder to distinguish between my feelings and Veronica\u2019s feelings. Maybe there is no difference anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly stopped for a moment and looked up the ceiling before continuing: \u201cThen I talked to Josh. I knew him before... Veronica knew him before. She had a crush on him but despite her rebellious attitude against her mom, she was a too shy to talk much to him. That changed a couple of weeks ago though. I just felt so lonely, since you were busy with our plan and somehow, I ended up talking to Josh... And we noticed our mutual attraction... We went on a few dates and I just couldn't tell you. I felt like I betrayed you for enjoying myself while you have to suffer so hard.\u201d Lilly began to sob. \u201cTonight... We both decided to take it to the next level and make out. Don't worry, we used protection... Not that I could get pregnant with my current equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan put an arm around her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u201d, he said. \u201cIt's not your fault and there is no need to feel guilty. To be honest... I enjoy my life right now as well. I didn't want to tell you either because I thought you suffered so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at him with big, teary eyes. \u201cReally...? Even the...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled and nodded. \u201cEven the sex I had with Greg. I even thought about wanting to keep this life. I really am glad that I've found a wonderful man and have such a wonderful daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly suddenly hugged him and buried her face in this shoulder. \u201cI had the same thought. I don't know if I want to go back to being who I am. Shit, I even forgot how my name was supposed to be again\u201d, she said with relief in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo sat there for a while, not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny thing is...\u201d, Lilly began as they had broken up the hug. \u201cI was reluctant to go out with Josh at first. I had a crush on you, you know? The real you, this Jason kid or whatever your name was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are bad at remembering our neighbours' names\", said Ethan, not yet fully grasping what Lilly just told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, mom, but that's who I am. Anyway, I knew that I had feelings for you... But right now, I still feel love for you, but not the kind of love I had before. I feel love for you as my mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan finally comprehended what she just told him and began to laugh really hard, which lead to a very confused expression on Lilly's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe two are hopeless\u201d, Ethan explained when he had calmed down enough to talk. \u201cI was in love with you as well but couldn't tell you. In hindsight we could have been so much happier if we just told each other stuff. Heck, this talk should have happened much sooner. My feelings right now have changed as well, I love you like my daughter and I love Greg like a woman should love a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled at him. \u201cI'm glad to hear this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled and got up from the couch. \u201cCome on now, it\u2019s getting late. We go to bed now and starting from tomorrow, we stop chasing our old lives and try to live the best life we can have right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded and hugged Ethan. \u201cI love you, mom\", she said before going upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, too, sweety\", he replied before cleaning up the kitchen table and going to bed as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few weeks passed by like a blur. Ethan's mood had gone drastically up since his talk with Veronica, funny how hard it became to think of her as anyone else as his daughter. This good mood had an impact on his work as well. His boss praised his work a lot, which just added to his mood even more. As much as he now enjoyed his job more, he enjoyed seeing Greg even more. Especially seeing him naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had gotten really good with the make-up and enjoyed dolling himself up for Greg. Sure, he wished he could see an attractive feminine face instead of the drag queen when he looked in the mirror, but since Greg did not seem to mind, he did not either. And it's not like he could change his face without the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly enjoyed her life as well. Just like he was going on dates with Greg, she was busy dating Josh. Ethan was slightly conflicted with this. As her friend, he was glad that she found someone. He knew he should be jealous, but even though he could still view her as his childhood friend, he was unable to see her as the girl he was in love with. As her mother on the other hand, he was concerned that she did not make any mistake. She promised him that she was careful, but she was just a teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much I can do though\" was the only conclusion regarding that matter. If her mother did not allow her to do naughty things with Josh, she would do it more than ever. Besides, Lilly was always very careful with everything. He could trust her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only thing that was nagging him from time to time. How much of Lilly was left in Veronica? The more time passes, the harder it got for the two of them to remember their old lives. It felt kind of scary, a death of an identity. Actually, the death of two identities, since they are not becoming copies of Andrea and Veronica Jefferson, so you could argue that these identities are also dying. Or could you even call that dying? Maybe they're just fusing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with this train of thought\", thought Ethan as he shook his head. \"I am me and that's what is important. I enjoy my new life and I shouldn't jeopardize it with these stupid philosophical questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanishing these thoughts, Ethan got out of his car and looked at the apartment building Greg was living in. It had seen some better days for sure, but it was still nice looking and in a nice part of town. With a big smile on his face, he clicked over to the door and looked for the correct button to signal Greg that he is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had invited him over to dinner, he was cooking. Being a not so formal occasion, Ethan was only dressed in a short sleeved, white, flowery blouse, a knee length, white pleated skirt and his favourite white 2-inch heel pumps. Over his shoulder he had his usual black leather purse swung and his ears and neck showed off a white pearl earring and necklace combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg lived on the sixth floor, but luckily the elevator worked. Ethan would not have liked to meet Greg out of breath and with hurting feet. His shoes were definitely not made for stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the elevator arrived on Ethan's destination, his heart began to race. He had seen Greg multiple times now, even had sex with him multiple times, but seeing his apartment? You can only get to know a person if you see their apartments, right? Ethan was afraid to see a side of Greg that he might not like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid, Andrea\", he thought, not even noticing that he has not called himself Ethan for a month now. \"Greg is such a sweet guy, nothing about him could push me away from him. I love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a still racing heart, Ethan clicked out of the elevator room as the doors slid open and could immediately see Greg standing in front of him, with a single red rose in hand. He was dressed in a nice black suit with a black tie. Greg immediately bowed down and kissed Ethan's hand. He then handed over the rose to Ethan and said: \"I'm so glad you made it, beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blushed and took the rose out of Greg's hand. Only a giggle was able to leave Ethan's throat at first, but then he managed to get his composure back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, darling\", he smiled. \"This wasn\u2019t necessary though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shook his head. \"No, everything for you. Come in, the dinner is almost ready\", he smiled and lead Ethan into his apartment. Ethan was relieved as he saw a small apartment with nothing out of the ordinary. Greg probably did not really bother decorating it with much after his divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help him with that\", Ethan thought as his painted nails curled into a smile. The former boy had learnt that he had quite a thing for decoration. He was unsure if it was because of his swap with Andrea or if he naturally had this ability. Not that it mattered. The Andrea he was had this ability, that was what mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg lead Ethan into the living room where a table with a single flower and a few candles stood just beside the kitchen area. The plates were already in place and he could smell the alluring aroma of chicken in the air. Greg helped Ethan sit down on the table, just like a gentleman. Ethan's heart was almost bursting out of his chest, not from fear like it had been moments ago, but because of excitement. He loved this man so much and his current action multiplied these feelings even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the greatest cook, but I think I can do quite a passable caprese chicken\", he said as he went into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells lovely\", smiled Ethan. \"I bet it'll taste just as good,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment Greg came back with a big dish of chicken and put it on the table. He immediately put something on Ethan's plate, then his own. He then went back to the kitchen and came back with two wine glasses and a bottle of said drink. With a smile, he put the glass next to Ethan, the glass had already been filled. Greg then took place opposite of Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", smiled Ethan and took a quick sip from the wine glass before grabbing knife and fork. \"You don\u2019t mind if I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg smiled and shook his head. \"No, no. Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took a bite. \"Mh! This tastes great!\", he exclaimed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it. I have been a bit nervous since I haven\u2019t cooked for anyone in a while. I feared that I had gotten a bit rusty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled and put his manicured hand on Greg's. \"It tastes lovely. I really appreciate what you are doing here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then continued with a bit of small talk while eating. Ethan hoped that this night would never come to an end. Before the swap he would have never imagined that he could be so happy just sitting here and eating dinner with a man. He was not sure if it was because of Andrea's memories influencing him or if he really felt like that, not that he cared in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that would make Ethan never forgot this date was still to come. He was just about to finish his glass of wine when he suddenly felt something metallic pressing against his lips. Putting the glass away from his lips, Ethan looked at the content of it. He saw the red fluid of the wine and right in the middle was something shiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\", Ethan asked and looked closer at it. It was tiny, shaped like a circle but had a small bulge at the side where he could see something glistening. It took Ethan a few moments before his brain registered what he just saw. \"Is that?\", he asked and looked up to see Greg was not at his place anymore, he was suddenly kneeling beside Ethan's chair and suddenly took Ethan's free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, some might think this may be too soon, we're only dating for a few months now\", began Greg and looked into Ethan's eyes. \"But I just feel this connection between us and to be honest, I don't want to wait anymore.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, the whole world cut away. In an instant, Ethan found himself somewhere else. His mind did not register it fast enough though, as he was just in the process of giving Greg his answer. So, he blurted out \"Yes, yes, oh god yes!\" before realizing that everything had changed. Within a heartbeat Josh's reaction changed to a loud and long drawn \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, trying to get his bearings. This was not Greg's apartment, that was obvious. The room was smaller and decorated like it belonged to a teenage boy. For whatever reason, the room felt oddly familiar to Ethan. It slowly dawned on him where he was. It was his old room, the one he lived in before he became Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no, no\", he repeated again and again and looked restlessly around the room. The room was lit and he was alone. He then looked down at himself and saw that he was back in his own body and clothes, although he did not recognize the shirt he was wearing. It looked new. A quick check between his legs confirmed that he was 100% normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? How can I be back to normal?\", he asked himself and looked outside his window over to the Jefferson's house. Just then his phone, which was on his desk, began vibrating. Ethan went over and saw that Lily was calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Why am I me again? Are you also back to normal, Ethan?\", Lily greeted him on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just as clueless as you are\", he responded. \"One moment I'm in Greg's apartment and she's proposing to me, the next I am back in my teenager room and body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, he proposed to you? Never mind, that's not important right now. For me it was the same. I was hanging out with some friends in Veronica's room when I was suddenly back in my room\", she explained. \"And now that I tell you that, I suddenly notice how easy it is for me to think of myself as Lily. Hell, I can remember my actual name! It's as if all the swaps were reverted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they probably were. But why? I've got to hang up now and try to find that out. I'll call you when I find something out\". Ethan put his phone away and rushed out of the house and went straight to next door's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised to see a crying Andrea open the door. If she reverted the swaps, should she not be at Greg's place receiving his proposal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless... The factory reset\", concluded Ethan. \"Right you can swap everything back, but every Action taken will stay the same. But the swapplet has a function for when you fuck up too much. You can reset every swap and reality resets itself in that way that everybody acted like he normally would. And since Mrs. Jefferson would be the one doing all the decisions the last months, she wouldn't have met up with Greg. Or if she did, she would have probably pushed him away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\", sniffed Mrs. Jefferson and motioned Ethan to come in. \"I\u2019m really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan entered the house he had lived in for the last months. For now, he could clearly remember everything that happened during his time as Andrea, but would those memories fade away like the ones of his teenage life before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sat down on the couch; Andrea sat down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you reverse everything?\", was the first question that left Ethan's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I fucked up... because I was a horrible person!\", she cried and burned her face in her hands. \"At first, everything was so good. I had a loving husband, two loving children, even though I knew that my son was a middle-aged woman. I even improved my body and my family's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan tried his best to understand her through her many sobs and sniffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then... everything went wrong. Harold left me for his secretary. He said I was had become too bitchy and he did not love me anymore\", she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan figured that this was probably the fault of the swaps she did to herself, his father and her own personality. Combined they resulted in his father leaving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea had to calm herself before she could continue. \"Both my children distanced themselves from me. I couldn't get them to talk to me. Then I sat down and thought about everything I've done since I got this device. I forced you and your sister to live the life of my daughter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was my friend you swapped with your daughter but you wouldn't know since she was my sister when you made the swaps\", he thought but did not interrupt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forced this poor little boy to dress like his mother and this teenage rowdy... Even he did not deserve to suddenly be swapped with a teenage girl. And after that there were so many more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea fell silent and then cried out again. \"I'm so sorry... I couldn't take it anymore. I had to reverse the swaps. Especially after I noticed how you seemed to have my life turned around. It showed me that it was not my life that was horrible... I was horrible. I factory reset everything. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for having your parents break up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I enjoyed my new life!\", yelled out Ethan. \"Greg, my boyfriend, was just proposing to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\", she sniffed heavier. \"I can't make anything right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ethan felt bad. Sure, she had robbed him of his life, twice, but she reset everything back to normal. \"Did she though?\", he asked himself. \"I've just lost almost half a year of my life. Even with the reset I have no idea what happened in this time. Not to mention that I still have strong feelings for Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen\", Ethan began and tried his best to stay calm. \"Where is the swapplet... the device? I can't forgive you for what you have done, at least not for now, but I can at least keep you from causing any more miserey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea pointed to the kitchen without even looking up. \"It's on the kitchen counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Ethan got up and walked over to the kitchen where he found the swapplet. He took it and went back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you feel remorse, but I- I just don't have it in me to forgive you\", he said and could see a slight nod from her. \"I'm going now. With the swapplet. It's best if we don't see each other for a while. You should try to get your life straight. It can be hard, but it's doable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Ethan left the house without a word. Outside he immediately phoned Lily and told her everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never forgive that bitch\", she said angrily over the phone. \"First, she makes me her teenage daughter, then she basically steals half a year of my life! If I had been there, I would have punched her in the face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you would not have been any better than her. I could see that she is suffering\", Ethan said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. I still don't want to see her for now. Anyway, what about the swapplet? What should we do with it?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. As we just saw, when used wrongly, you only cause suffering. But it also gives us so many possibilities. I'd advice we go to bed now and meet up tomorrow. Then we can discuss everything calmly\", he said and hung up after wishing Lily a good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan then walked back to his own house and own room. It felt strange to sleep in his own bed after all that time. Just as it felt strange to have a penis and flat chest again. When he was confused and angry earlier, he did not notice how different his body felt, but now that he had calmed down, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was late, Ethan got undressed and went to bed. Before he fell asleep, he thought about Greg. Would he see him ever again? He wanted to be with him. After a while, he noticed another problem. His feelings for Lilly were returning as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now I have two people I yearn for\", he thought and pressed his eyes shut. He just wanted to sleep and not think about this crazy day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night and the morning were uneventful but strange for Ethan. The night itself was dreamless, which he was glad for. The morning seemed unreal. As soon as he awoke in this familiar yet unfamiliar bed, seeing those walls he had seen for years, but now looking like something from a distant dream. When he got out of bed, he at first felt breasts dragging him forward but when he looked down, there was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this something akin to phantom pain\", he thought and walked out of his room to the bathroom. It took him a moment to remember where that exactly was. In front of the toilet, his first reaction was to sit down. Only as he had his underwear down and was feeling the cold of the bowl touching an organ he lacked for months, he remembered that he now had a penis again and could pee standing up if he wanted to. After a quick shower, he got dressed in a red shirt and jeans. He put the swapplet inside his backpack, after a minute long search for his purses, before remembering that this swap has been reversed as well. He grabbed the backpack and went downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was equally as strange. While it was nice to have breakfast made for him, he felt like a stranger around his parents and sister. He also missed the quiet mornings with his daughter. While his parents and sister chit-chatted, he stayed silent and tried to pinpoint his unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt like two person in one. It was unlike before, where he had the memories of Andrea trying to overwrite his own. Ethan's guess was that he could still remember all the memory changes because he was immune to the reality altering process of the swapplet. After all, he could not remember a thing \"Ethan\" did in the last six months, only the things he did as Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladly, nobody in his family asked him why he was so quiet today. As he was finished he quietly left the house. The sun was shining but it was still chilly. No wonder as it was still winter, even though spring was just around the corner. He took his bike and began riding over to Lily's house. He quickly looked at the neighbour's house that had been his home for the last few months. He could see light coming from Veronica's room and wondered how she is doing. Due to his time as Andrea, a part of him still viewed her as his daughter, even though he had never spent much time with this version of Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is so fucked up\", he thought as he accelerated. Before leaving the street he could see the little boy that Mrs. Jefferson had put in his mother's clothes going for a walk with his mother. He did not seem to be too disturbed that he was suddenly back in his own clothes, but he probably had a harder time figuring out what happened due to his age and his lack of knowledge about the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems happy though\", thought Ethan with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ethan arrived at Lily's house the door opened before he could even touch the doorbell. Lily had been watching on her window for him to come. She quickly ushered him upstairs to her room. The two were alone in the house for now, as Angela had a dentist appointment. Ethan calmly sat down on Lilly's bed. The two looked at each other for a while, both unable to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s weird, eh?\", Ethan broke the silence. \"I suppose you have this dual memory thing as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded. \"Yeah. I know everything I knew yesterday when I was still Veronica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too. I even feel my breasts from time to time. Yes, I know I don't have them anymore, but still. How is it like for you? Apart from the life swap you were pretty normal at least\", he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still had your penis and it's weird having a vagina again. I even made quite a mess today in the bathroom, when I tried to pee\", she chuckled. \"Apart from that, I think I'm doing fine. It's weird of course. Being older, bring in a different house and being someone else\u2019s daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. \"I can imagine. Anyway, what should we do about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the swapplet out of his backpack and laid it on the ground between him and Lilly. \"We now saw what happens if it falls in the wrong hands. Mrs. Jefferson was drunken with power. We have to be careful that this doesn't happen to us. We also have to be careful not to lose it again\", he said in a serious tone. \"We both know it can't be destroyed. Sealing it away somewhere might be a possibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute\", she said surprised. \"You're not thinking of that, are you? What about the endless possibilities we have with the device? Those were your words yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you really want to use it? Just look how messed up we are right now. I am Andrea and Ethan at the same time!\", he said, full well knowing that he exaggerated a bit. Yes, he knew everything Andrea knew and he still had the feelings he had as her, just like he had his memories and feelings as Ethan, but he could tell without a problem that he was Ethan. There was no other person inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're exaggerating\", replied Lilly, knowing how he feels. \"I mean yes, we are messed up right now but it\u2019ll fade away, just like our memories and feelings as our own selves faded away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan let his head down in defeat. \"Yeah, probably. We\u2019re not 100% certain about that though. What if we stay like this? With dual memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shrugged her lithe shoulders. \"This can't be something we can't live with. Besides, the memories aren't that bad, only the feelings. I especially have one particular memory I now treasure more than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly got up and sat herself right next to Ethan. \"The one after your christmas party to be precise\", she whispered. \"Where we finally told each other about our feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gulped as he noticed how close he was to the girl he loved. A small voice told him that it was perfectly normal to be this up-close to his daughter. The more time passed, the quieter this voice became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\", he asked nervously. Even though he was able to tell her that he loved her when he was Andrea, now that he was back to being good old Ethan, it was not as easy anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", breathed Lilly softly into Ethan's ear. \"And I meant it back then and I know you meant it as well. Just like I know that you are too shy to say it out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at Lilly, his own head red as a tomato, his breathing heavy. Surprised he noticed that Lilly was equally as red as him. She had to muster up all her courage to talk to him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did\", he said and took one of Lilly's hands, trying to summon all the courage he had. \"And I still do. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pressed his eyes shut and kissed her. She seemed to be surprised at first but then returned the kiss.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long moment of silence, Ethan finally answered to her request. \"Fine, you deserve a, let\u2019s call it vacation. But only on the conditions that you hand over the swapplet and promise to swap back with my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson looked at the device in her hand, then back to Ethan. For a moment she thought about just keeping it, swapping him and his sister in a way where they would not be dangerous to her, but it would not be right. Deep down she knew that she basically stole these kids\u2019 mother and no matter what she would do, she would always be something like a step-mother for them. She did not intend to go back to her own life though, maybe something else might come forth. With a smile she handed the swapplet over to her new son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", said Ethan and quickly gave the tablet to Lilly to get it out of reach from Mrs. Jefferson. He then looked at Mrs. Jefferson, unsure of what he should do right now. \"I'd say you should start by telling us what swaps you made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I didn't swap much so far. I only swapped lives. Oh, and I swapped our job skills, I didn't want to embarrass myself when I went to work\", she reported. \"But I'm curious, what swaps did you two do? I know I can't notice them, just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at Lilly, who simply nodded and then told her about the swaps they did, at least the ones which were still in effect. She did not need to know that he had occupied the life of his French teacher or the family role swap with his mother that even Lilly did not know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson looked at the two with a bit of disbelieve. \"You really are not siblings? And Susan is actually called Lilly? And Ethan is not supposed to have these big breasts and vagina, while Susan shouldn't have a penis? I'd say you two tried to pull my leg, but I know what the device is capable of\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. It was nice to see that even the ones who knew about the swapplet are unable to believe the swaps that took place prior to them getting in contact with it. So, nobody would ever find out about his purse swap. \"Even though it feels rather tame compared to the rest of the swaps we've done\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group had taken a seat at the kitchen table during the conversation, with Lilly and Ethan sitting opposite of Mrs. Jefferson. \"What now?\", asked the older woman. \"No offense to your swaps, but I'll continue to call you Susan, dear. I have called you this for as long as we know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. It's my name right now anyway\", answered Lilly. \"Anyways, I think we can all agree that we should stay like this for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was a bit surprised to hear Lilly say this. Before she had been adamant about using the swapplet, but now she wanted to not use it? Their situation from half an hour ago really did change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson looked surprised. \"You don't want to use it? You're already bored with this power?\", she asked, knowing full well how tempting the device was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head. \"Thanks to you, we both went through something like an existential crisis. We thought that we would never be able to return to our normal lives again. Lilly thought she could never see her family again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\u2026 I didn't mean to\u2026\", mumbled the older woman regretful. \"I didn't mean to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\", tried Lilly to calm her down. \"We're not mad at you, you couldn't know what it did, when you tried to get it. But yeah, like Ethan said. We want to keep the swaps to a minimum for now. Although\u2026 A small swap couldn't hurt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is again\", thought the only boy in the room with a sigh. \"I guess she is much more susceptible to the power than I am\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\", asked Mrs. Jefferson curious. She wanted to explore the possibilities of the swapplet after getting a small glimpse of what it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell\", began Lilly with a broad grin. \"You see, 'your son' over here has these really nice body, unfortunately he has to hide his proportions because he has to wear boy's clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\", exclaimed Ethan and looked at his friend-turned-sister sternly. \"If you want to swap something, and again I advise you to be careful, leave me out of it. I have enough swaps to cope with right now, I don't want to walk around in women's clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grinned and punched her 'brother' softly. \"Don't worry, bro. I was just joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Jefferson smiled. It was so good to see children that were enjoying themselves, not like her own daughter. \"Technically they are my children now\", she thought and got up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we don't have anything more to discuss, I'd suggest I start making dinner\", announced Andrea. \"Any wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Her' two children shook their heads. \"No, everything is fine, Mrs. Jeff- I mean mom\", Ethan said, finding it awkward to call someone else 'mom', but he thought it was appropriate right now. As far as the world was concerned, she was his mother and he wanted to be nice to her, so he played along, which he would have to anyway when his dad arrived home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly and Ethan took the swapplet and got upstairs, leaving a humming Mrs. Jefferson behind. \"I've not seen her that happy in years\", said Ethan as soon as they were out of hearing range. \"I don't really want her in my mother's life, but I can't be so cruel and deny her this vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too soft, bro\", smiled Lilly. \"But I know what you mean. And it's not like your mother would notice anyway. It would also be kinda hypocritical when we would not allow her to stay like this for a while, we haven't even had a single thought of poor Stacy who was thrusted into my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right\", agreed Ethan, who was just happy to have the swapplet back. The two entered Ethan's room, like they had done so many times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing that sucks is that we have to explain why we were not in class today\", sighed Lilly as she made herself comfortable on Ethan's bed. \"I guess 'mom' could tell the school that there had been an emergency or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shrugged his shoulders. \"Doesn't really matter and if worst comes to worst, we can always swap with the school secretary and change some things about our records.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, you don't want to swap around and tell me to be careful, but when it suits you, it's okay now?\", pouted Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Yeah? Maybe? I don't know. I just thought that in the worst-case scenario, we could, you know, use the thing that brought us in this situation in the first place. I'd say it would be justified\", explained Ethan and sat down beside her. \"But, I'm not really in the mood for thinking about school. I'm more worried about the same thing I was worried an hour ago: The swapplet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", asked Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, that we need a safe hiding place for the swapplet. If we leave it in the house, it could get found by my mom or dad, although the former shouldn't be a problem right now. If we take it with us, can we really guarantee that we don't lose it?\", explained Ethan with a worried expression on his face. \"Also, we now know that other people have noticed the thing dropping into my backyard. If Mrs. Jefferson was able to spot, why shouldn't somebody else? We must keep a close eye on the neighbourhood. I doubt that anyone farther away could reliably tell where it landed or even see what landed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if you were just as thorough with your school work as you are with hiding the swapplet\", joked Lilly. \"But I guess the safest thing would be to hide the device in your purse when we go outside, but underneath all your stuff, on the bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be the best for now\", agreed Ethan. \"But we have to find a permanent solution to the problem. We can't risk losing it again.\"</span></div></div>",

Since the purse had not been closed and the swapplet was above everything else in his purse, the small impact of the collision was enough for the alien device to fall out of said purse. It landed on the lawn and was soon hidden by the grass that had grown rather tall and not been cut in the recent time, something Ethan was supposed to do last weekend but forgot and supposedly wanted to do next weekend. The fall in itself, no matter the height or the material it would have landed on, would not have damaged the swapplet like it would damage a regular tablet, since it was an alien device and merely took the shape of a tablet to be familiar with users of this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, who had been talking to Ethan prior to the collision, was too invested to see the swapplet fall out of Ethan's purse and Ethan himself as well as Mrs. Jefferson had of course other things on their mind. Thus, the three people soon departed and unknowingly left the alien device lying down in the grass. That's where it would have been when Ethan and Lilly came home, but when they arrived at the house there was no trace of its whereabouts. While the two swapplet user were hunting shadows, the swapplet had been found and taken by someone. That someone was\u2026</span></div></div>",

That was the moment he saw something shiny in the grass. Gnawing his teeth, he went over there. \"Damn kids, loitering someone's lawn\", he whispered angrily to himself and wanted to dispose the garbage but as he got closer, he noticed that it the shine came from a tablet instead. \"Who throws something like that on the ground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man grabbed the lost tablet and his eyes widened in shock as soon as he touched the device. In the time span of a heartbeat, his mind was flooded with a dozen of information. What the device was capable of, how to use it, etc. Harold gasped when the flood of information dried up and looked in disbelieve at the tablet that was still lying in the grass. Carefully, he tried to pick it up again and this time, nothing happened. Looking at it from all angles, he could not find any indications that this was not a normal tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this really work as I think it works\u2026?\", he whispered, then looked around. There was no one on the street right now and he decided it would be better to look at the device in privacy. If it were true what this thing was capable of then he would not want to anyone know about it, at least no stranger. If not, he did not want anyone to think that he spies on someone's tablet or something like that. He hurried over to his car, entered it quickly and looked at the tablet, making sure the tablet was as hard to spot from the outside as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Register user\u2026\", he read, immediately knowing what it meant and how he had to do it. After he was registered, he found himself in the menu that allowed him to select targets. These however were fairly limited right now, as he did not want to wander around the neighbourhood until he was fully convinced that this thing was real. Even a short trip over to his neighbour's house was out of the question. What would he tell if someone asked him why he approached their house? \"Hey Frank, I just wanted to test if this tablet can really swap peoples traits\", he mumbled sarcastically. \"No, this is really not an option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance through the living room window of his house, showed him his wife getting ready for work. His time was running out, he had to leave before she got her stuff and left the house. Her car was in their garage, while his stood in front of it, since he had to get to work earlier than her. When she left, she would notice him still being there and questioning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I have a problem with sharing this with her if it is real\u2026 I just don't want her to think I'm crazy if it doesn't work, though I suppose I am crazy if it doesn't work\", he thought and selected his wife. \"Makes it easier if this reality altering thing doesn't work either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the only thing that was left for him was to choose what to swap with her. It had to be noticeable, so something mental was probably out of the question. He narrowed his choices on something small, something she would not notice right away if she would freak out. Just then Lilly looked out of the window and saw him sitting in his car, confused why he had not left yet. Quickly thinking, Harold acted like he read an email on his phone, then turned on the engine. As he had no time left, he quickly swapped their hands, the option his index finger hovered over, and through the tablet on the passenger's seat, while simultaneously shifting the gear to reverse and drive his car out of the driveway. During this he felt his hand feel different from one moment to the other. As he waved his wife goodbye, he got a good look at his smaller, daintier hand that now possessed a clear polish manicure. Looking at his wife, she seemed to possess his big, manly hands, as far as he could tell from the distance anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way to work, he was amazed at his hands. Sadly, he could not confirm that the reality change worked or not but given that the swap itself worked just like he somehow knew, he assumed that all of his knowledge regarding this strange tablet would be 100% correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is so strange to look at these hands, which I held a million times in my own, from this perspective\", he thought and had to concentrate to not get too distracted from it. It would have been too dangerous if his new hands drew his full attention while he drove to work. He had time for that when he arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that he did. As he parked his car, he looked at his hands from all angles, touched one hand with the other, touched his face, even caressed one of his arms carefully with one of his now manicured fingernails, something that he liked when Lilly did it. His female hands then went down to his crotch where his brain got the most confusing information he had ever received. While his member told him that his wife was touching and holding it, his hands told him that it was himself. Even with these mismatching information, his member grew harder and he got more aroused, restraining himself as he was sitting in his car in a public parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the tablet in his small, female hands and thought about what to do next, finally deciding to\u2026</span></div></div>",

He was not interested in being stuck with his wives' hands for the rest of his life or forcing someone to live with swaps, even when they themselves would never know, given that the reality altering stuff really worked. Navigating through the menus, he used the \"Reverse Last Swap\" option and found his hands back to normal. It had been exciting for him to touch things with his delicate new hands and he decided he would probably swap again that night to have some fun with his wife Lilly. Maybe he should even let her in on the secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze went outside where some people were walking on the streets, entered buildings. Nothing out of the ordinary, but Harold's perception of his surroundings was different this time. When he looked at someone, he was more interested in what he could swap with said person. He knew that it worked, he knew what he was capable of, but knowing was not enough, he had to experience it to fully comprehend the power this device gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see\u2026\", he mumbled as he focused on a young girl in her late teens maybe early twenties, wearing an ordinary black skirt-suit with 2-inch heels, who was hurrying to the front door of the same company, he worked in. The company was fairly big, and it was impossible to know everyone and just like that he had no idea who this girl was. Could be an intern, could be someone who scored a job interview. She could be the daughter of someone. He had no idea, nor did he really care. Targeting her with the device, he could see all information on the screen. Not really looking at them though, he had to do the swap before she went out of side, he quickly selected her breasts and bra. Before he pressed confirmed he hesitated for a moment and also checked the gender box, being curious how his co-workers would react if he was considered a woman. Just before the girl, he thought he read the name Nicole from the corner of his eye, vanished inside the building, Harold pressed the confirm button and instantly bent over as he found two orbs sitting on his chest. A quick glance beneath his shirt showed him a plain, white bra holding what appeared to be B-cups in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick squeeze and a surprised moan later, Harold left his car and began making his own way towards the big building he worked in. With every step he took, he could feel the slight bounce of his new breasts, a feeling that caused a certain reaction in his nether region. Luckily, his pants were loose enough to not show a too distinct bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way to his cubicle was as unspectacular as always, although he could have sworn that the guys he met on his way had their eyes on him for longer than usual, especially on his chest area. It was subtle enough that he could have just imagined it but given what he knew about these swaps he was sure that it was because they thought of him as a woman. \"But I kind of doubt that the dynamics would drastically change. I didn't swap friends or any relationships and most are professional enough to not make any difference regarding gender or race\", he thought. Truly, there were only subtle changes in behaviour that showed any signs of a swap having taken place. The women, who worked on the same floor as he, greeted him with hugs, something they normally did not. For the men it was more difficult to pinpoint exactly what had changed. They seemed to be more reserved around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time advancing and his job settling in, everything felt normal. He even forgot his new breasts once in a while and was surprised if he accidently brushed them against something or the other way around. As his stomach began to make itself noticeable, he decided to get something to eat and also test out his new device even more by\u2026</span></div></div>",

He could try swapping two other people or himself. In both cases he would need some good subjects to make swaps with and his empty stomach made the decision process difficult. Thus, he decided to postpone his decision until after his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a plate, Harold let his gaze wander over the different individuals that had gathered in the cafeteria, looking for good guinea pigs for this incredible power he now possessed. He pondered whether or not he should include himself in it but came to the conclusion that being on the receiving end of a swap was more exciting than simply witnessing someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, he had done two physical swaps, namely switching hands with his wife, which he undid a while ago, as well as breasts with that girl he did not know, a clothing swap, he had gained the girls bra, and a sort of mental swap, where he had exchanged his male gender for the girls female one. Cupping his breasts, grinning broadly while no one was looking and if someone did, he did not care, he squeezed them in excitement, his member reacting to his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold's gaze soon fell on an attractive young lady, probably in her mid-twenties. She had long blond hair, done in a pony tail, and was wearing a black skirt suit with high heeled pumps. Just like the original owner of his breasts, he had no idea who she was but she would be a good next target, the question itself being what he wanted from her. Caressing his breasts absentmindedly while he was thinking, he decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Selecting the clothing option, he had decided to swap every article of clothing the girl possessed. Instantly feeling the cool air on his now pantyhose clad legs. The skirt that belonged to his new skirt suit was more restricting than his pants were and the panties he wore underneath all of that were, although adjusted in size, not cut for his equipment. Not that Harold cared as his member became harder and harder. A quick glance below his blouse showed him that his plain, white bra had been exchanged for a lacy, green one. He guessed that his panties matched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl on the other hand continued to eat her salad, wearing Harold's old suit. If he had been able to, he would have released the pressure from his member right at that moment, but there were people watching and the kinky thought of having sex with his wife in this form was more than enough to make him be patient. He had never thought about crossdressing before but the forbidden nature made it exciting for him right now and that nobody would notice made it even more arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll tell Lilly about the device\u2026\", he thought, not even knowing that his wife's name was actually Susan and had been swapped with the real Lilly who he thought of as his daughter but was really his son's best friend. Harold tried to calm his member down by pressing his legs together but the feeling of his nylon clad legs rubbing together was even more arousing. He knew that the rest of his work day would be long now, eagerly awaiting what would happen later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his meal, he got up and click-clacked back to his cubicle, shortly stopping in front of the women's bathroom. Although his member had calmed down, it was still semi-errect and clearly visible through his tight skirt, not that anybody seemed to care. He almost went in to \"calm\" it down even more but then decided against it, coming to the conclusion that the night would be even sweeter if he did so.</span></div></div>",

Already swapping clothes with that girl right away was in hindsight not such a bright idea. It kept reminding him of all the power he now had at his fingertips, but it also felt really kinky and made his desire to go home and have fun with his wife even stronger. After what felt like an eternity, he could finally go home and that he did, possibly got some speeding tickets as well. Not that he cared. He could just swap with someone who is responsible for that and change that. He could do so much with this little device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's for another day\", he thought with a grin and left the car. The sun was already setting, and he could feel a cool summer breeze on his pantyhose covered legs. Harold closed his eyes and simply enjoyed himself for a moment. Feeling the arousing heaviness on his chest, the cool air on his legs, even his changed posture due to the pumps he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops\", he said after he took a few steps towards the door and immediately turned around to his car. This was a fairly common ritual for him, as he routinely forgot his briefcase in his car. The only difference to all the other times he went back to his car, apart from the obvious changes on him, was that his briefcase had turned into a big leather purse. In which he had put the swapping device. \"I really need to think of a name for it before I tell Lilly about it. If I even tell her about it, we'll see\", he thought as he grabbed the purse with the invaluable treasure inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home\", he exclaimed as he entered the house and kicked off his pumps, feeling sad and happy about that at the same time. Sad because the excitement of wearing something he should not was gone, happy because his feet slowly began to hurt. He almost put the purse on a hangar out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, mom\", he heard the two voices of his children Ethan and Susan who were currently watching TV in the living room. The two seemed down for some reason, but he guessed it was some teenie stuff and he was not in the mood to handle that right now. There was one thing he was interested though. His children called him \"mom\", which made sense, he was considered a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they call us mom 1 and mom 2 or something like that, to differentiate us\", he thought as he went upstairs. Usually he would have gone straight to the kitchen to greet his wife who was in the process of cooking dinner, which he could smell, but today he had more important things to do upstairs. Namely, hiding the device. Although \"hiding\" would be an exaggeration. Since he planned to show the device to his wife later, he simply put his purse in their shared bedroom. If he decided to not show her, he could easily hide the device somewhere else later. Lily would never look inside briefcase, why would she? It was full of stuff for work. While this was not true for his purse, he doubted that she would look inside anytime soon. Thus, the device should be safe from prying eyes, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the source of his power stored away safely for now, he hurried downstairs, enjoying every bounce of his breasts on the way. From the smell, he guessed that dinner should be ready any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, beautiful\", he smiled as he entered the kitchen, immediately putting his arms around his cooking wife. Harold got aroused as he felt his newly acquired breasts press against his wife's body. Like always he kissed her and right now he would have loved to take her upstairs and have some fun immediately. His stomach and his kids were preventing him from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello as well, my love\", she smiled back at him. Normally she would have called him handsome, but Harold guessed that due to the gender swap she did not and needed something else to not simply repeat what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's almost ready\", she said and turned her attention back to said dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold nodded and began grabbing the dishes and putting them on the table. As excited as he was for what he would do with his wife, maybe she wanted to use the device for some kinky stuff if he told her about it, he had already waited since lunchbreak, he could wait a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following dinner was as uneventful as his workday had been. Both his children were very quiet, not that he minded, his own mind was already in bed with his wife. Fortunately for him, it was his kids turn to do the dishes, which gave him the opportunity to take his wife upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the time they had dinner, Harold had decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Having her clueless about the swaps though was kinky itself and he only had this one chance if he wanted to let her in on his secret. Besides, it would be much easier if he swapped back everything before he told her. He would be in such a mess if she thought that him being a woman with a penis was the default.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his wife was getting ready in the bathroom, slipping on something more 'comfortable' as she liked to call it seductively, he used the opportunity to look inside their shared wardrobe. It had expanded since last time he had seen it, in order to accommodate for two bigger sets of clothing. Amused he noted that he could easily make out which clothes belonged to him and which to his wife, due to 'his' looking more youthful, like they belonged to a twenty-year-old woman, while his wife's were more modest. This was not the only reason though. As he absentmindedly brushed over a knee-length, leather pencil skirt, he was surprised that he somehow remembered buying it together with his wife and that he knew that it was called a pencil skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror and amazement, he looked over to the swapplet which he had put down on his nightstand. Even though deep down he knew about the power it possessed, his mind was just beginning to accept this knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back around to the wardrobe and decided to have more fun as long as he could. He grabbed a black teddy and matching stockings with a certainty as if he himself had sorted everything inside, not being slightly surprised that he even knew what was inside. A quick glance over to the bathroom door where his wife was getting ready, then Harold began undressing himself, getting down to just his bra and panties. With a smile he cupped his new orbs, safely secured in a plain bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not for long\", he thought with a grin and got out of his underwear. The feeling of his breasts hanging loose was a strange but at the same time arousing one. He then carefully got into the black teddy, carefully securing his breasts again. This time in more nice-looking cups. He then sat down and slowly rolled the see-through sock like things over his hairy legs. Harold had to admit he liked the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was finished putting on his outfit, the door to the bathroom opened and his wife entered. Harold turned his head around and saw his wife in a black and red negligee, her lips in a deep red and her face made-up beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you made yourself 'comfortable' as well\", she purred, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", he replied grinning and stretching his arms out to tell her to come over, which she did not have to be told twice. She gracefully walked over to him, her heels clicking on the ground. Harold could feel his penis harden and tenting up his teddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold grabbed her when she was in reach and pressed her against himself, kissing her in the same process. Kissing his wife, especially when both where in the mood, was always very arousing for Harold but this time the arousal was amplified by having his own breasts rub against his wife's. The soft feeling of the teddy, the feeling of his nipples harden, Harold felt like he was in heaven and his mind shut down and let his member do his thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled over. Now that he was on top of his wife, he began discarding both his and his wife's clothes. With both of them naked, Harold wasted no time and entered his wife, a simultaneous moan escaping both of their mouths. What followed was the most amazing sex Harold had ever had. While pumping in and out of his moaning wife, he let his large, feminine nipples circle around his wife's which aroused him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay too soon for Harold, everything ended in a big explosion and he rolled exhausted from his wife, who was breathing just as heavy as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone was really excited today\", she noted out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you see\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

Her expression changed from a worried look, that her husband had gone crazy, to a look of astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be\u2026 It's impossible that this works!\", she said looking at the device she touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works. You know it. Here let's register you\". He pushed his wife's hand gently away from the tablet and began making the necessary inputs to register her. \"Done. Now here, take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it and looked at it with a mixed look of curiosity and fear.  \"Harold\u2026 This is insane. Something like this can't exist\u2026\", she muttered while she observed the device from all angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use it. Like I said, you won't believe me otherwise. Come on, you know how to operate it. Use it to swap something between us\", he encouraged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starred at it for a while, still in disbelieve. Harold on the other hand waited. He would not push her to use it, he knew that this would upset her, and she would take it away or something. He would not want to risk that. He knew that she would get curious enough to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt to Harold like an eternity, she finally made a decision and began touching the various prompts that appeared on the smooth surface. Right as she made a decisive finishing touch, Harold could feel a familiar pull on his chest as it inflated itself and two orbs emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\", exclaimed Susan surprised and dropped the device, which landed safely on the bedsheets and in her lap. \"It really works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold grinned broadly. \"I told you so. And you knew that it would work. I have no idea why we both knew but we knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get something like this?\", she asked and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"It lay on the grass in front of our house this morning. I have no idea how it landed there. I picked it up, believing it was a toy from the kids or something. Then it hit me, just like it hit you when you touched it. I knew everything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose you tried it out? Otherwise you wouldn't have believed it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Yes. I first swapped hands with you. And like you already know, you did not notice a thing.\" He paused for a moment and pondered whether or not he should tell her about all the other swaps but decided to not hide anything from his wife. \"I reversed the swap as soon as I got to work. There I swapped with some women though. I came back in women's clothing, with breasts and everyone, including you, thought of me as a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be\u2026 You looked like this when you came home. And you were always a man\", she told him in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you haven't been registered in the device you are unable to see the changes. Not even when I tell you that\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan nodded. \"Yes, you're right. I know.\" She then looked back at the device in her lap. \"So, what now? This thing is dangerous. We have to get rid of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it though?\", he asked and took the tablet from out of her lap. \"Everything we do can be reset. Nobody except us and anyone we wish to, will see any difference. Come on Susan, aren't you as tempted as I am to use it? For fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the device and then at her husband, thinking about what to do.</span></div></div>",

How about we both swap lives?\", she suggested. \"I need a break from teaching these kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold looked at his wife intently. \"I don't know. This would be weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan raised an eyebrow at her husband. \"Weird? You told me you had sex as a woman with me. How could that be weird? Besides, I only suggested swapping lives not bodies, if you mean that my old body is too weird for you to be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it like that\", Harold said and held his hands up in defence. He already did not like the direction this conversation as heading. \"I just meant that it would be weird to act like you in front of out kids. That's all! I love you and I still love your body after all those years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled and gave her husband a quick kiss. \"I know, I was just teasing you\", she said. \"But you'll be fine. We'll also swap our knowledge of how to do our jobs. Don't want to risk you getting fired. Maybe we should also swap our cooking skills, since the kids would be suspicious if their dad cooks the meal and I don't let you near my kitchen anymore after this dinner accident 15 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder Harold thought back to the day. Stacy had just been born and with Ethan not really taking it well that he suddenly had someone who rivalled his parent's attention, Harold decided to give his wife a break. He took a week off and cleaned the house, cooked and watched the kids, while his wife could relax and refresh her energy. This plan went well, until it came to dinner, where Harold nearly burned the whole house down. He had never been a good cook, he usually ate take-out food or his mother's food before he met Susan, and since Susan loved to cook, he of course never honed his skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was still not my fault\", he said defending his actions from years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to argue about that. As long as you don't have my cooking skills, you are not allowed to cook in MY kitchen\", she said and made it clear that there was no arguing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ok fine\", he said in defeat. \"How long do you propose we stay swapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a day or two\", she said and began touching the swapplet. \"Maybe longer if we enjoy it. There, there aaand there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold suddenly felt himself shift in space and saw his equally naked, but flat chested wife standing where he stood a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did work, right?\", asked Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", he replied. \"Just like it worked when you gave me these babies.\" He cupped the breasts he had swapped with his wife minutes ago. \"Do you want them back by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan shook her head. \"No, you can keep them.\" She walked over to their shared wardrobe and wanted to get her sleepwear out, it became quite chilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, since you have my life, you have to wear my clothes\", she said as she held up her nightgown which was now way too big for her. \"No, you can really keep my breasts, since I suppose I don't have bras anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be fixable\", he said and grabbed the nightgown and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where would be the fun in that?\", she asked him as she got dressed in his pajamas. \"Now let's go to sleep, Mrs. Harrison, tomorrow may be friday, but you still have to go to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. Harrison. The same goes for you\", he grinned and went over to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second. That's my side of the bed\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I always\u2026 Oh, I get what you mean. Does it really matter though? Nobody except us will notice\", Harold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will notice. Come on, if we're gonna do this, then let's really do this\", she said and pushed herself past him onto his side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold shrugged his shoulders and went to bed on her side. Both fell asleep almost instantly.</span></div></div>",

You already are sound like a mom\u201d, joked Lilly. \u201cI guess now that our plan stands, we have to wait until your parents are back home. How about we look up a nice restaurant that doesn\u2019t need any reservations, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Harrison, Ethan\u2019s mother, was the first one to arrive home. Normally she would start making dinner, but that would go against their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here we go, you have to swap with her now. Then you tell us that you and your dad are going out tonight and give us money for pizza or something\u201d, commanded Lilly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll follow as your dad as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was not looking forward to being put in women\u2019s clothing again. He liked it, but it made him feel uncomfortable when people saw him in that, even if only one person could actually notice that it was wrong. Second guessing that this was really the right decision, he looked out the window where his mother just got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cold feet now\u201d, said Lilly who noticed his hesitation. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will be fine. We\u2019re going to have a great, mature evening and get to eat some really good food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faint sound of fingers hammering against glass, made Ethan look over to Lilly who began entering the necessary inputs in the swapplet before he really tried to back out of it. He opened his mouth to say something, to maker her stop, but then decided to stay quiet. Like before, the thought of getting to eat some exquisite food was more than enough to make him want to do this. In the same moment Lilly finished the inputs, he found himself standing outside the front door, keys in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt the sensation of his changed clothes, a blue blouse, a black pencil skirt, a black jacket and matching black pumps. He also felt a messenger bag around his chest. \u201cRight, I have mom\u2019s purses now, so she has to use something else to store her make-up and such\u201d, he thought and put the key in the key hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-kids?\u201d, he said hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019m er home. Your\u2026 Your dad and I will be going out\u2026 Tonight. So, er, I\u2019ll put you some money on the kitchen table. Order something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay mom! Have fun!\u201d, came the voice of his mother from upstairs. Ethan sighed in relief. It would have been awkward to meet his mother right now. After he grabbed the money out of his bag and put it on the table, he went upstairs into his parents\u2019 room and locked the door. He did not want to be bothered by anyone while he chose something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wanted to go to a nice, but not that fancy restaurant. Evening gown and such things would be total overkill, but he wanted to let his mother look good anyway. \u201cNot that she doesn\u2019t look good in what I am wearing right now, but these are the clothes she normally wears for work, so hardly appropriate given the location we want to go to\u201d, he thought as he opened the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock made him startled as he was looking through his clothing options. He went over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe, Lilly. Just wanted to make sure everything worked fine\u201d, he heard his friends voice coming from the other side of the door. \u201cI\u2019ll swap as soon as your dad arrives here. Will be a bit more difficult as I have to hide the swapplet from your mother. She really thinks she\u2019s you, by the way. Really creepy. She doesn\u2019t know anything about the swapplet though, which is good, but makes my next stop harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll manage\u201d, said Ethan. \u201cAnd even if she notices, just make sure you swap before she can ask anything. The device will travel with you and my dad living your life won\u2019t know a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, answered Lilly. \u201cAnyway, gotta go. Told your mom I needed to use the bathroom and she\u2019ll wonder why I\u2019m taking so long. See you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan heard steps getting away, then a door being shut, then silence. \u201cOkay, back to business\u201d, he thought and rummaged through his mother\u2019s clothing collection. He eventually decided on a dark red dress that went to his knees and black, knee high boots with a 2-inch heel. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope that Lilly is not asking me why I can walk in these. During my time as Ms. Dufour we only saw each other briefly, so she probably did not really notice how adapt I am walking in them\u201d, he thought as he took a few steps. He hoped that the make-up he gained through the life swap would be enough, he had no idea how to apply it and not look like a clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Ethan heard a car turning off in front of the house. He looked out of the window and saw his father getting to the front, only to be suddenly exchanged by Lilly. She walked in quickly, yelling a hello to the rest of the house and then went straight to the bed room where Ethan was waiting for her. He quickly unlocked the door and then sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your already ready\u201d, she grinned as she went in, wearing the black suit his dad wore for work. \u201cSince I am already wearing a suit, I guess we can go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan wanted to protest. If he had to bothered to dress somewhat more presentable for the restaurant, than she should do, but his stomach told him to shut up and go with her. He got up and followed her, his heels clicking on the floor. His dress had no pockets which made him wish he would have swapped his mother\u2019s purses back, at least for the time being. A backpack, messenger bag or something like that would look hideous, so he had no other chance but leaving his mothers money, phone and everything else at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to the car, Lilly opening the door for Ethan like a gentleman, then getting behind the wheels and driving off.</span></div></div>",

After finding out about your little\u2026 fetish\u2026 I've been thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, definitely don't like where this is going. Wait, so you did hear me when I accidently said that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did hear you. So, what?\", she shrugged. \"Does that make you to anyone else than you? Anyway, I thought about this. You probably enjoyed running around in these clothes, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded hesitantly. As much as he hated the heels right now, he had enjoyed being able to run around in women's clothing without being seen as a weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? So, I have thought that maybe you should keep her clothes. And maybe, my dear Jos\u00e9phine\", Ethan could tell that she liked calling him by his life\u2019s name. \"Maybe you should swap lower halves with her as well. I mean, you already have my vagina and her legs would definitely make your skirt look better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan cocked his head from side to side and pondered about Lily's suggestion. It sounded tempting and having the killer legs of Miss Dufour was something he would enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? You have warmed up for the idea\", grinned Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why only the lower half?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, you want to have more than just her breasts?\", grinned Lily teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shrugged. \"Not necessarily. I was just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so\", she muttered, raising an eyebrow. \"I just thought that having those massive things for any longer would be too much for you.\" Lily paused for a moment, thinking, then continued. \"Since you were so honest about your secret, let me also be honest to you: I kind of want to borrow her breasts for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded, figuring that she probably was jealous of those breasts that all the boys in school were lusting after. \"Fine by me. You want to take them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily grinned and took the swapplet and carried out her plan. In an instant her breasts began to baloon outward while Ethan's began to shrink, noting that his bra was adjusting with the same speed. He looked at Lily who stared in awe at her new cleavage, hanging freely from her chest due to her wearing Mr. Anderson's clothes. She grabbed them disbelievingly and muttered: \"Awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan cleared his throat. \"Can we now continue with our plan? If we waste more time here 'Ethan' and 'Lily' will be gone home, and we can't make the swaps you want anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, my dear Jos\u00e8phine\", grinned Lily. \"You are always such a thoughtful woman, what would I only do without you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly annoyed, Ethan snatched the tablet from Lily's fingers and left the room without saying a single word, his heels click-clacking with every step. Lily grinned as she looked after her friend and admired how the tight skirt made his ass look and the heels made his hips sway slightly, then she followed him, catching up with ease.</span></div></div>",

It was not the first time he had seen Ms. Dufour without breasts and in the very clothes he had put on this morning, the look was bizarre, nonetheless. Mr. Anderson on the other hand did not simply look bizarre, he looked ridiculous. Lily's tank top was stretching over his muscular chest and his just as muscular and hairy legs were poking out of his black skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry\", hissed Lilly and grabbed the swapplet out of Ethan's manicured hands and began adjusting the settings. \"If they're out of sight we can only use the reset option and that would reset everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ethan could even reply to her, she had already made the swap. He suddenly found himself transported to where Ms. Dufour had been. Disoriented he looked around and saw Lilly standing next to him, back in her clothes. Her tank-top was being stretched to the limit by Ms. Dufour's breasts. Now that she was in her own clothes again, Ethan completely noted that she was smaller now, due to him wearing heels. She had not changed height, but she looked smaller and more petite in her clothes than she looked in the Coach's clothes. Her bigger breasts looked strange in her usual clothes though, pushing her white tank-top to the maximum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time\", he heard Lily say as she adjusted her white tank top. \"Come on, move it. We don't want to draw any attention.\" She began walking down the street after handing him the swapplet. Ethan took it and put it in his purse but stopped surprised. Instead of the stylish, black leather purse he had gained from his mother, he now had a very expensive looking, brown purse slung over his shoulder. He recognized it as Ms. Dufour's purse. Ethan opened his mouth but closed it a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably swapped purses as well or forget to uncheck it, unlike accessoires apparently\", he thought and clicked after Lily as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you kindly move slower? I'm not used in walking in heels\", he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are\", she replied. \"I swapped Ms. Dufour's high heel walking skills. It's not like she needs them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. He could keep up with her and walk like he had done so for most of his life. \"Okay, fine. But can we still walk a bit slower? I may be a pro with them now, but that doesn't make walking fast in them any easier and more comfortable. Why are you hurrying anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get somewhere where many people are. I want to use the swapplet more. This device is addicting!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan wanted to sleep after his playtime in his new outfit, but he just could not. In the back of his mind, there was this small voice telling him to continue his investigation in the possibilities of the swapplet. This urge that told him to get up and look for another \"victim\" to swap with. After what felt like an eternity where he tossed himself from one side of the bed to the other, just trying to find some sleep, he got up, straightened his red teddy and took the swapplet in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just too tempting to have something like this lying around and not using it\", he thought as he absentmindedly turned the device in his hands. It was still so unbelievable that such a small little thing had so much power. Power over reality! Which also meant he had to be careful. A quick glance at his phone told him that it was 2am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly anyone awake right now. This will make it much easier to get some swaps done without the danger of someone seeing me with the swapplet\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led him to another problem though: With hardly anyone awake, his options were fairly limited. He could swap with his neighbours if he was lucky enough that someone left his window blinds untouched. \"Or do I?\", he thought, but soon something in his mind told him that he had to have visual contact with the person he was swapping with. It did not matter if he saw the person via CCTV, through glass or via a skype call. As long as he could see the person live in the moment, he could swap with her. \u201cThis sudden knowledge really comes in handy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat of course meant that Ethan\u2019s options could only be slightly widened. He doubted that any of his friends in school were awake right now or wanted to skype with him at this late hour. Live streams, like gaming live streams or even cam girls. They would limit his options, a life swap for example would be out of question. He would be unable to swap back, because he would be unable to see \u201chimself\u201d again. Some other swaps were out of question as well. If he swapped breasts with a cam girl, who knew if they would still be a cam girl or if the reality altering decided to change her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd of course no sudden knowledge this time\u201d, he sighed and grabbed his mother\u2019s pink, silky robe to conceal his inappropriate attire, as well as giving him some protection against the cold. It was still late summer, but he at night it could get chilly. Slowly and carefully he opened his door and stepped outside on the hallway. A quick glance through the long stretched room told him that his family was asleep right now. He tip-toed to the stairs and went downstairs to think and maybe catch a glimpse on someone on the street or one of the neighbours windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only light source outside was the street lamp and given its location, it barely provided any light for Ethan. He could see that someone of the Gibson family across the street was still awake or this person fell asleep in front of the TV. Either way, he could not see the person thanks to house walls. The rest of the houses were dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally limited options here\u201d, he sighed and sat down on the couch. Sure, he could sneak over to the Black\u2019s house and try his luck by peeking through the window. Maybe he could see the person in front of the TV. The TV itself was another possibility. Maybe he found some live show, just like he could look for some live stream on the internet. Of course he could still swap with his family, but it was not as appealing to him. The last possible solution was that he might be more lucky if he looked over the backyard fence. His room unfortunately had the window on the street side so he either had to sneak into his parents or sisters room or he had to peek over the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to risk waking his family up just to inspect his options, Ethan slipped into his mother\u2019s, now actually his, black ballet flats, the only pair of shoes he quickly found downstairs, and made his way to the fence. He grabbed a chair to give him a small height boost and made his way across the backyard. To his dismay, the otherside was just as barren and dark. With a big sigh, he returned the chair to its original position and began pondering with whom to swap. At last he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He kicked off his ballet flats before going up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly went over to his sisters' room and held his ear against the door. He could hear faint and steady breathing noises. \"Good she is asleep\", he thought. He slowly opened the door. His heart stopped as the door cracked while opening and the steady noises stopped, and his sister turned around. Luckily, she continued to sleep. Not wanting to endanger his mission any further, he decided to use the device from this distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what should I swap with her?\", he wondered as he touched through the options of the swapplet. He already had his best friend's vagina and hair and his mother's clothes and purses. He could get some physical swap from his sister. Her breasts were not as big as their mother's, but this may be better for now. Maybe swap legs with her? Faces just for fun? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could try out another mental change. Get her name? Get a skill she has? Maybe her interests, maybe then he might finally understand why she is so crazy about animes. While yes, he indeed enjoys some animes, he was by no means as crazy about them as his sister. She got furious if he pronounced the names of characters wrong or dared to use the English title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother possibility would be that he swapped clothing with her, even if it meant to give up his mother's sexy underwear. But he would possibly gain his sister's cosplay collection and while he did not know most of the characters, he had seen his sister in some of the skimpier outfits, that would categorize more as lingerie as clothes, recently. She did look hot in some of them, if he could say that about his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting some kinky thoughts as he looked over to Stacy's wardrobe that was not only filled with her normal clothes but with her cosplay clothes as well, he decided to swap clothes with his sister. Sure, he would lose his mother's sexy lingerie, but he could wear some interesting stuff. He was not that into anime as his sister was, but he had seen a couple and knew of some outfits his sister possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few strokes on the smooth surface of the swapplet, Ethan soon found himself wearing his sister's nightgown which had the image of some half naked guy from an anime he did not knew on it. A quick glance over to his sleeping sister, he could see her wearing the red teddy and had to chuckle. His mother would never allow her to wear something. At least not until she is older. Slowly and quietly he shut the door and snuck back to his room, where he immediately saw the differences. On his desk were several wigs, as well as a sewing machine. Ethan wondered whether he also inherited his sister's cosplay hobby or if their relationship got weirder with her still being into cosplay but making her brother wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I would have to find out\", he shrugged and went over to his wardrobe that had gotten a lot more stuffed as he anticipated. Inside he found his sister's clothes as well as her sizable cosplay collection, all resized to fit his larger body. \"Let's see\u2026 I've seen her wear it not that long ago\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ethan rummaged through his wardrobe he wondered if his sister had no way of sorting her clothes to make it easier to find something or if this was a side-effect of him owning the clothes. His clothing collection was manageable and thus he had never bothered with anything besides \"just stuff it in there\". After a while he found the items for his corresponding outfit. As Stacy was just 15 and rather shy, she did not have any skimpy outfits he had seen some girls wear, especially on Halloween, but he had to admit that a school uniform could be sexy as well. Not to mention that Ethan was turned on by wearing women's clothing anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the white blouse with a big, red bow and the dark, knee-length skirt in his hands. He never played the game she belonged to, Persona 3, before but he had seen his sister play it as well as some pictures on the internet. He was not particularly interested in role playing games, but he had to admit that he found the character \"Mitsuru Kirijo\" rather sexy in her school uniform. Dressing up as her, as he had wanted to do ever since his sister made a cosplay of her, but never could because of their completely different sizes, was a stimulating thought. He quickly put on the blouse and skirt and managed to fasten the bow after a while. To finish his outfit he grabbed black, leather boots with a 3-inch heel and the matching red wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way in front of the mirror, he noticed one small problem with his plan. While he had some experience walking in high heels, thanks to him sneaking into his mother's bedroom and wearing her shoes when he was younger, and they had the same shoe size, he never wore heels this high. He stumbled awkwardly and slowly towards the mirror. Quickly he straightened out the wig and carefully made poses in front of the mirror. If he still had his penis, his skirt would have been tented out a long time ago, but with Lilly's vagina, he was feeling it becoming moist. Carefully he went over to his bed and began rubbing it through his skirt, familiar soft moans, which he had already made during his playtime earlier, escaped his mouth. Soon the caressing was not enough anymore, and he began to hike up his skirt and put a finger into his vagina. The moans kept intensifying, coupled with the arousal of wearing the cosplay, he soon climaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Ethan looked at the ceiling with a big smile on his face. He took a last quick glance over to the swapplet before falling asleep due to exhaustion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan awoke and felt weird. His knees felt barren, while his lower legs felt as if they were encased in something leathery. His head felt hot and something was tickling his neck. His upper body felt encased in some soft material that was not completely closed off, as if there were little holes were something like a button was holding to sides of a clothing piece together. He also felt something woollen hanging in his face. The biggest difference though was the lack of morning wood. \"What?\", he asked surprised and suddenly remembered everything. The genital swap with Lilly, the family position and clothes swap with his mother and at last the clothes swap with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big yawn he sat himself up in his bed, strands of red hair falling into his face. \"Riiiight. I remember\u2026 I fell asleep and haven\u2019t taken off the cosplay\", he mumbled, still half asleep. \"I better get out of it\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the blouse, skirt and boots, put the wig away and hung the cosplay back into his wardrobe. As he looked at the collection of clothes that had mysteriously appeared in the stead of his own and pondered whether he should keep them or not. His sister was never fashionable and mostly wore clothing with anime motives. Not that he himself was fashionable either, but he was not in the mood to wear her \"weeb\" clothes. With a few touches and swipes on the trusty alien device he found in his backyard, he soon found himself in the sexy, red lingerie of his mother, his sister apparently had either not woken up or not dressed herself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These clothes are something different though\", he thought as he brushed with his one hand through the various clothing articles that had suddenly appeared in his wardrobe. They were so soft to touch and the thought of wearing them was exhilarating. His mother was more fashionable than his sister, but she of course dressed like a middle-aged woman, which is reflected in her wardrobe. \"But that makes this all the more exciting\", he thought with a grin and took a knee-length, pink, flowery skirt into his hand and held it in front of his legs. If he still had his little friend, it would have showed his presence already, but without it, he just felt a dampness between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn\u2019t mind wearing something of hers to school\", he thought and glanced into his wardrobe to look for something matching, which was easier said than done. \"Maybe, I need some help with that. I should swap fashion knowledge with my mom. Better got out dressed like a fashionable, middle-aged woman than a mismatched, colourful teen.\" Ethan also had to admit that he had enjoyed the swaps he did yesterday and wanted to use the swapplet more. It was the thrill of the power he now possessed as well as the thrill of having certain things that he normally would never be able to get. Rubbing his pussy, as he thought about going to school in these feminine clothes, caused him to remember something: Lilly was in the database, or however you would call it, of the swapplet and she therefore notices all the swaps he will make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I explain this to her?\", he thought while taking his mom's favourite sundress off the hanger and held it in front of him. \"She doesn't know that I like dressing like that and I'm not really sure if I even want her to know. I, of course, can always tell her that this was just an experiment, that I just wanted to test the boundaries of the swapplet. Or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the sundress back on the hanger and into the wardrobe. He then grabbed the swapplet, looking at it and finally deciding that he wanted to keep his mother's clothes for the day. He would find an excuse for Lilly when the time has come. Maybe he should just tell her the truth then, as his friend she would hopefully understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Try not to think about the future but think about the present\", he grinned and quickly threw a nightgown that he spotted over his naked body and left his room to find his mother. Not that surprising, he found her in the kitchen, preparing breakfast. Quietly he used the swapplet and made his swap, not wanting her to notice his presence. Just as quiet he went back upstairs and into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good\", smiled Ethan as he closed his door and leaned against the door, feeling the cold wood through his thin nightgown. \"I think I now know exactly what to wear. The bigger question would be if I want to wear some high heels or not.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling wild today, Ethan decided that he wanted to experience his newfound womanly clothes as womanly as possible. He looked through his wardrobe and quickly found what he was looking for: His mother's black, 2-inch heel pumps. Holding the Item of desire, something that turned him on for years now, in his hand and being able to wear it outside in public without getting strange looks, this all made him excited even more. With a gleeful look he placed the pumps on his bed and began working on the Rest of his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the rest of the outfit though?\u201d, he whispered as he consulted his mother's fashion knowledge. He quickly decided on a blue blouse and Black, knee-length skirt combo. Nothing exciting and something he could have chosen without his mother's knowledge, but then he could experiment with that later. When he got dressed, his new-found fashion sense told him that he needed some jewellery as well. Looking around the room, he found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, that didn't come with the clothes swap... Whatever. I'm not in the mood to go downstairs, swap with mom and go upstairs again to put on the jewellery. It will have to wait until later\", he shrugged and admired himself in his full-length mirror. He lacked the womanly curves and did not fill out the outfit as well as his mother would, but it fit him nonetheless, as ridiculous as he looked. Not that he really cared. Wearing this outfit was really turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few steps in his pumps he noticed that while he had experience walking in them, thanks to his \u2018interest', he felt kind of wobbly and insecure in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI better swap that with mom when I'm downstairs\", he thought and put the swapplet in his purse before leaving his room, the exciting click-clack of his pumps following him. \u201cThis is going to be a good day\", he thought with a smile as he closed his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs he was greeted by the mouth-watering smell of pancakes. Deciding not to lose any time, he grabbed the swapplet and again made a swap with his mother. His posture suddenly shifted, and his careful steps became more confident. It felt like he now had years of experience of walking in heels, which he now had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome\", he smiled and walked over to his usual spot on the table. His mother had already put some pancakes in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks mom\", he said to her and began to eat. A laughter almost escaped his mouth as he saw his mother in one of his old shirts and pants he used as sleep wear, a pink apron atop of it. His gaze immediately went back to his plate, not wanting to explain why he laughed if he continued looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father and his sister soon joined them and with this the usual morning talk. Ethan did not participate in this though. His mind was too occupied with the swapplet. He pondered what swaps he could do between his family members, but soon concluded that he would have to wait. The swapplet was big and it would be too difficult to hide it from his family and he really was not ready for any questions about the swapplet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better keep it down\u2026 At least until I'm outside\", he thought while chucking down his pancakes eagerly. \"I have enough time to test this sweet little toy later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the last bit of pancake went down Ethan's throat, he stood up, almost jumping out of his chair, and went to the front door. \"I gotta go to school. Goodbye\", he excused himself. The door slammed shut before his family could even react.</span></div></div>",

But he wasn't ready to have any of his family's body parts just yet. Instead, when he hit the \"Accept\" button, Ethan looked down as his t-shirt morphed into his mom's black tank top, her bra appeared around his torso, his pants transformed into his mom's flowery skirt and he was suddenly boosted up three inches by his sneakers morphing into his mom's high heeled pumps. More importantly, Ethan now found his new pussy clad in his mom's comfortable cotton panties that matched his bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more aroused, Ethan gave his snatch a quick rub again through his mom's former skirt and panties with his free hand. Then he grinned when he looked over at his mom and saw her dressed in his t-shirt, cargo pants, boxers and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a new phone again sweetie?\" His mom suddenly asked, seeing him stood there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shook his head, caught a little off-guard. \"Uh... no, it's er... it's nothing.\" He replied to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come and get your dinner.\" His mom said, smiling as she carried the crock pot to the dinner table. She hadn't noticed her change of clothing, and neither had his dad or sister. Ethan was amazed by the power of his Swapplet. And he was glad he now had his mom's clothes, they went a lot better with his purses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward carefully, Ethan's heels clicked on the kitchen floor as he walked, causing him to look down and smirk. True, his hairy legs didn't look too good with his mom's nice skirt, but... that could be remedied easily enough. Stopping abruptly and stumbling a little, he tapped some more settings into his Swapplet and swapped all his body hair from the neck down with his sister. He looked down as his leg hair was sucked back into his skin, along with the rest of his body hair. And Stacey sat down oblivious as light hair sprouted on her arms, legs and other places. But, it wasn't copious amounts, so Ethan didn't feel too guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need your legs waxing sis.\" Ethan mumbled to his sister, drawing an icy stare from her. Since she was wearing denim shorts, her hairy legs were evident more than Ethan's had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it! I'm going to the salon tomorrow okay.\" Stacey bit back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave your sister alone sweetie.\" Ethan's mom said, giving him a gentle clip around the ear as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom.\" Ethan chuckled, resting the Swapplet on his lap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His interest had awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing over the skirt he wore as he looked down on the tablet in his lap. He really liked the skirt; it was arousing to wear one. His legs also looked way better in it, now that they were hairless. \"And I'm definitely looking forward to inspecting my wardrobe\", he thought with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut dinner was first, and Ethan thought about spicing it up. With an idea popping up immediately in his head, he reached for the device and began changing the necessary options. As he hit the confirm button, the change immediately took place and Ethan suddenly had his mother's manicured hands. He admired \"his\" long fingernails with red nail polish. His mother on the other hand now had his slightly bigger male hands, which looked strange with her wedding band on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These will become handy later\", he thought and began operating the Swapplet again, this time it was more difficult due to his longer fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Ethan did not change as soon as he confirmed his inputs.

The effect was noticeable, as his dad's new breasts shifted upwards as the bra encased them on his dad's chest. And Ethan didn't mind giving up the bra, since he was still wearing the rest of his mom's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing a little in the kitchen, adjusting to wearing his mom's heels, Ethan soon made another swap, this time between his dad and his sister Stacey. It took a moment for him to confirm the swap had worked, because it took a few moments for his dad to speak again. Stacey's teenage girl voice left his dad's lips, causing him to put one of his feminine hands to his mouth and stifle a giggle. This whole thing was so cool, not to mention erotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when Stacey eventually talked in their dad's deep, masculine voice, it was even funnier. Then again the voice matched the body hair that Stacey now had from the neck down, even though it was his and not his dad's former body hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there holding his Swapplet in his mom's former hands, and occasionally brushing Lily's former hair from his face, Ethan could feel Lily's pussy getting wetter between his legs as he stood there, tensing his toes inside his mom's resized high heeled pumps. He suddenly wanted more feminine attributes for himself, and so he was soon activating the Swapplet again. This time... he looked down and watched his mom's former blouse inflate as his sister's perky breasts were transferred to him... along with her bra. Stacey on the flipside was beginning to look and sound quite manly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt his new feminine nipples become erect due to his arousal, all the while his family remained oblivious to his exchanging their body parts. <i>Oh god...</i> He thought, admiring his now flat-chested mother and sister and his busty dad.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Give me your tablet!\", his mother demanded, confirming his suspicion about the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\", he replied and tried to get the swapplet away from her. \"Won't happen again\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. It won't\", she said and grabbed at the swapplet. Sitting at the table, Ethan had no choice but to let her touch it. His mother's expression turned from angry to confused in an instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put it in my room. Sorry mom\", Ethan quickly said before she could begin asking questions and went upstairs to his room as fast as he could in his heels. His mother looked after him speechless while his father and sister just shrugged their shoulders and continued eating their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\", thought Ethan as he closed the door behind him. \"She knows about the swapplet now\u2026 Just what I needed\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the hi-tech device frustrated onto his bed and casually glanced around the room, immediately noticing that his dirty clothing pile had changed to his mother's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, I have to talk to her before she tells Dad or Stacey something\u2026 It's bad enough that she now knows about it\u2026 She'll take it away from me or something\u2026\", he thought as he wandered up and down his room, his manicured hands rubbing on his forehead as if it would help him think. \"I guess I have no choice but to go downstairs and hope that she stays quiet until after dinner. Then I have to talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly as he had entered his room, he got out of it and almost ran into his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk\", she whispered and dragged him back into the room he had just left. \"I don't know how I know it but this tablet of yours is not a normal tablet. I suppose I don't tell you something you didn't know yourself already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded slowly. \"Yes\u2026 It crashed into our garden yesterday. I picked it up and had the same happen to me as had happened to you when you touched it\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't tell me or your father about it?\", she asked him indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I?\", he replied and threw his hands up. \"If it was just some hallucination or something you would think I'm crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Everything you know about it is true. It works exactly like that\", he said and sat down on his bed, right beside the alien object. \"I tried it out with Lily\". Ethan had decided that it was the best to not let her in on the swaps he had made with her. He had a feeling that his mother was interested in the device, just like he was. If he played his cards right, she might want to borrow it for her own curiosity but let him keep it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else knows about it?\", she asked and lowered her voice while seating herself next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Lily, you and me\", he told her truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told Lily about it?\", she asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan shrugged. \"Yeah, of course I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan noticed that his mother wanted to say something, but she decided to stay quiet. Her gaze then went down to the swapplet. \u201cAnd what did you swap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We exchanged hair\", he answered and decided to also keep quiet about the genital swap for now. His answer caused a sceptic look on his mother's face. \"But you always had long hair and Lily always kept her hair short. I remember making braids for you when you were younger and I remember when you dyed your hair red\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you do. You know very well that the swapplet, that's what I'm calling it, can change reality itself. For everyone but me and Lily, it is like I always had her hair\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother looked intently at him. After a while she used her manly hands and put them against Ethan's head, turning it around to look at it from every angle. \"It\u2019s hard to believe...\", she said slowly. \"How about we try swapping something? Nothing big, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but nothing major...\", he sighed. \"How about we swap voices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan grabbed the swapplet and was about to make the necessary inputs but then suddenly stopped. \"Oh, right. You may know how to use it, but you\u2019re not registered yet. Hold out your hand please so that it can scan you... aaand done.\" Ethan resumed his action while his mother looked at him with amazement. She was more amazed by the fact that she knew what was happening. After a while Ethan stopped and she knew that the swap had taken place. But she did not feel any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\", she asked carefully, still doubting her alien knowledge. She gasped in surprise and Ethan responded: \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible...\", she muttered. \"It really works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had to suppress a giggle when his mother began softly singing in his voice. It sounded so wrong having his voice coming out of his mother's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to tell your dad\", she then said as soon as she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", replied Ethan immediately. \"The less people know about it the better. This thing is too powerful to fall in the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the hands of some random teen are the right ones?\", she asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than some politician who would use it to get world domination or something\". He held the swapplet tight to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right there. Still, we must tell your father... Although...\", her face changed to an absentminded look. \"Maybe we shouldn't tell him right away... Give me the... what do you call it? Swapplet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan investigated his mother's face and only reluctantly gave her the device. He knew that he was at the mercy of his mother now and it would be better for him to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", she said, and a weird grin appeared on her face. She began putting in commands in the swapplet and Ethan had to control himself to not take it away from her, fearing that she now swaps something with him. Which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better\", she said in her own voice again. \"Now come on, we still have dinner to eat. I'll keep this thing for now.\"</span></div></div>",

His breast were so sensitive... He tried to hide the waves of pleasure that went through his body, but his erect nipples betrayed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you seem to enjoy them\", said Lilly with a smile on her face. \"But a bra could help you, they will be less sensitive on each move !\".

Imagine you made an unaware swap with me, giving me your hair. When I will come back home, I won't be aware of it, and I will maybe swap my hair with someone else and make you unaware of the swap. But if you try to get your hair back, it will not be yours, it will be the one of the person I swapped with, and you will lose your hair, without noticing anything. I don't want this kind of things to happen, except if we decided to do so. So yes, I trust you when you said we swapped something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. So, what I swapped is our bra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so strange. I remember wearing a bra for many years, I even remember when and where I bought them. Are you sure it's not a joke ?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not, and I can prove it. We swapped our chest, do you agree ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we did.\" Ethan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if you suppose I didn't swap chest with you making you unaware of the swap, it means that you normally don't have boobs, do you agree ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you don't have boobs, why the fuck would you wear a bra ? Moreover, this bra fits perfectly with your breasts, which means this chest goes with this bra. There are only to possibilities : or we swapped chest again, and I promise it's not the case, or we swapped bra.\" Lilly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems logical to me... That's right, I don't know why I wore bra everyday, but that seemed perfectly normal to me... To be honest, it still seems normal to me now, even if it's absurd... But I trust you.

At the same time, her tight feminine jeans turned into her friend's brown cargo pants, her panties into his boxer shorts and her yellow t-shirt became black, becoming what Ethan had been wearing. More noticeable to Lilly, was the fact she no longer wore a bra and her breasts hung loose underneath her now male t-shirt. \"Holy crap!\" She gasped again, still amazed by the Swapplet's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this feels... different.\" Ethan mumbled, turning red in embarrassment, dressed head to toe in Lilly's clothes, including her wedge heeled sandals.

I really should swap our experiences but not with just underwear but with all of our clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ethan was able to react, Lily had made all the necessary inputs on the swapplet. Suddenly, Ethan felt strange, but not the kind he was used to. The clothes that felt foreign and uncomfortable just mere moments ago, now felt familiar, just as if he had worn clothes like these for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, Lily!\", hissed Ethan. \"Why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To test out this sweet little device of course\", she giggled. \"And don't tell me you don't feel much better now. You probably also know how to fasten a bra or walking in heels. I sure don't anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan let out a big sigh and looked at her disappointed. \"Yeah, I do now. I do feel better wearing these clothes. This doesn't excuse your actions though! You can't just make any swaps with me without my consent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, don't get your panties in a knot\", she grinned. \"I promise I won't swap any more things between us, at least not without your consent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", Ethan said and looked less annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT\", she continued causing Ethan's face change back to annoyance. \"We will stay like this. At least for a little while. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed. \"Okay, fine. At least I don't feel weird anymore\u2026\", he mumbled and looked down at the unfamiliar yet very familiar clothes. He even knew where he bought that t-shirt and the jeans!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we two take a walk?\", asked Lily. Ethan responded with a shrug. He began grabbing the purse he had gotten from his mother but then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you think purses are considered clothes?\", he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily shrugged her shoulders. \"Only one way to find out.\" She took the purse from Ethan and began looking inside and got out his wallet and ID. \"Still yours\", she said and showed him his ID before putting it back inside and handing him the purse. \"Now come on.\"</span></div></div>",

We go around and see if we can use this little baby on some people\", suggested Lilly while caressing the tablet like a real baby. \"I want to see all its power with my own eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was not as sure as Lilly was, that this was a good idea. \"What if someone sees us? What if someone tries to still the tablet from us?\", he asked her concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shook her head and looked at him. \"You worry too much\", she said and tipped her manicured index finger against his forehead. \"So, what if anyone sees us? They will just think we are using some kind of tablet. And I seriously doubt that anyone would even bother going up to us and ask us what that tablet is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at her and processed what she said. She was right and even if they asked them what tablet that was, they could always say it is some custom design or something along those lines. If nobody touches it, nobody will know what powers it possessed. And since no one would notice the swaps they could not connect any dots, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Let's do this. Do you have any place in mind where we could go?\", he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 it should be a place where we are not too suspicious with a tablet, so the pool is out of question. Although I would really love to see you in a bikini\", she grinned at Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer a swimsuit, thank you very much\", he responded before turning pale. Die he really just say that? He gulped as he noticed that he the thought of him wearing swim trunks repulsed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grinned broadly. \"Yeah, I have the same feeling. Deep down I know that I should wear a swimsuit or a bikini to cover up my breasts, but the very thought of it is just\u2026 ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks to you swap. Anyway, pool is out. Where to then?\", he asked her, changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so, the mall would be a good place. Many people. Nobody would bat an eye when we are at a tablet\", she suggested. \"We could also go to the library. We would have to be quiet and there would be less people to swap, but it would be easier to observe them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could also go the park\", added Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", nodded Lilly. \"I'm fine with either of those choices. You decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan thought about it for a moment and then decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

She felt so much more comfortable in his clothes, and he could tell. Ethan didn't look comfortable wearing Lilly's clothes though, far from it. He pushed his long red hair behind his ears for what seemed like the umpteenth time since they swapped. \"You want to go shopping at the mall? We can get you a new skirt. maybe a couple of bras and some panties?\" She teased him a little, causing him to mildly scowl at her somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what I want is for you to swap us back, this feels... irritating.\" Ethan grumbled, tugging at the bra strap secured under his yellow feminine t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you know how it feels to wear one.\" Lilly nodded, grinning from ear to ear. It was no secret she was loving this. \"But... I'll agree to swap our hair back... on one condition.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is?\" Ethan responded. \"And what about our clothes?\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly chuckled. \"You can keep wearing my clothes for now, get in touch with your feminine side. And the condition is... you let me swap your family around a little. I mean, they won't notice anything right?\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Lilly wasn't heartless and was only a bit of fun, he nodded. \"Deal!\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then.\" Lilly said, as she tapped the necessary input into the Swapplet. Seconds later, Ethan felt his crush's long, curly red hair retreat back into his scalp, forming into his usual short blonde hair. He reached up and ran his hands over his head, relieved. But that still left him wearing Lilly's clothes. And he would feel so embarrassed wearing them in front of his family, even though they would think everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then.\" Lilly smirked, gesturing to the door.</span></div></div>",

Ethan was too embarrassed at first and hid half behind the entrance, but a raised eyebrow from his sister, who was reading through some manga while having a bite, made him enter the kitchen completely. When no laughter from either his parents or sister emerged, Ethan had his doubtful part that still believed there was no thing as reality warping reassured that everything is fine. The yellow shirt with the bra underneath, the tight jeans, the panties and the wedge-heeled sandals were completely normal for him to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's dad was sitting at the kitchen table besides his daughter and was engrossed in a newspaper, wearing the black suit he wore to work this day. His daughter on the other hand was dressed in a pink T-shirt with a cute anime girl on it, her legs were encased in a loose, frilly white skirt and on her feet were black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's mother on the other hand was busy finishing dinner. She wore a black tank-top, a skirt with a flower pattern and 3-inch pumps. She turned around as she noticed the two enter the kitchen. \"Oh, hello you two\", she smiled at them. \"You're staying for dinner, Lilly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled at her best friends' mother and not to grin at the possibilities of the swaps that went through her head. \"If I may\", she said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\", smiled Susan back. \"There is always room at the table for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", replied Lilly gratefully and sat down at the table together with Ethan, while his mother put another plate on it before turning her attention back to the dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you have in mind?\", asked Ethan quitely who was still looking uncomfortable in his friends' clothes, adjusting the bra straps that were annoying him multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First\", she began with a broad grin. \"I'll do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly quickly began touching the surface of the swapplet and when she pressed confirm, the newspaper of Ethan's father had changed into the very same manga his daughter was reading, while his daughter was now busy with the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You swapped the newspaper for the manga? Big deal\", whispered Ethan indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it\", explained Lilly satisfied. \"After our more physical swaps earlier, I thought about doing something mental for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\", replied Ethan. \"So, you swapped Stacy's interest for my dad's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\", smiled Lilly. \"Your parents' bedroom will probably look very different now, as will your sister's room.

They won't notice anything, you said it yourself.

Huh? They can be swapped around but yours can't be is that it?\" She said, trying to sound like she was genuinely insulted by what he had said. But she was trying not to laugh, seeing Ethan's reaction to what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... god no, I was just... I mean, it's all a little weird you know.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily rolled her eyes. \"Switching traits around is weird?? Wow, who would have thunk huh?\" She said, bringing Ethan's attention back to the fact that he was wearing her clothes and wedge sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just humor me, let's swap someone else. Like... Mrs. Jefferson next door or something?\" He sighed, while fidgeting a little in the feminine outfit he now wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\"! Lily smirked, instantly tapping the touch screen of the Swapplet. Ethan instantly dreaded what was coming and braced himself. Sure enough, seconds later, he felt his chest tingling, and when he looked down he saw Lily's former yellow t-shirt distending outward as two ample, middle-aged breasts sprouted on his chest, jiggling slightly as they did so. As the bra he was wearing was filled with his new tits, Ethan felt his cock pulsate in his panties. He had to admit, it felt good. He brought his hands up to his chest and grabbed hold of Mrs. Jefferson's breasts, which now belonged to him, at least for now. \"Hmm, they look good on you.\" Lily snickered, admiring her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny!\" Ethan muttered. \"Now swap me back.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet.

'<i>I wonder what Angela would do with this?  She would probably try to find some sort of fashion game or something.</i>'  She chuckled silently to herself as the thought came across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"  Ethan asked his friend and crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, really.  You wouldn't really understand unless you lived my...\"  She stopped and Ethan knew that look in her eye.  It's like something went off in her head and illuminated her thoughts into a clear path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Ethan wondered, still trying to get what she was talking about.  He brushed a stray piece of hair out of his eyes and tucked it behind his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I want to swap.\"  She looked at him with a huge grin on her face.  \"I want us to swap our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"  Ethan nearly shouted, but wanting to avoid any suspicion, silenced his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You said that I could pick what we could swap and that's what I chose.\"  Lilly replied with a matter of fact tone in her voice.  \"Are you too afraid to live my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that I...\"  Ethan started to state his case, but was a loss for words.  He'd read stories on the internet about guys swapping lives with girls and living their life.  Although most of the stories were that of revenge, he found them to be really great reads.  \"I just don't know how to live your life is all.\"  He crossed his arms across his chest in a seemingly defiant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard, I mean it's Saturday and we don't have school tomorrow.\"  She pleaded her case to her best friend.  \"You can go to my home and we can stay this way until school on Monday.\"  She looked into Ethan's eyes and tried to see what he was thinking.  Knowing that she was winning, Lilly thought that she would try to throw in something else.  \"I will even swap back our hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is going to be more trouble than it's worth.\"  Ethan sighed as he brought his curly red hair back to his face.  He was talking about having Lilly's hair and potentially having to live her life for the remainder of the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to do it?\"  Lilly asked with bated breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but only for the weekend.\"  Ethan pointed out to his friend.  \"Plus I want us to swap our hair back, before we do it.\"  He held out his hand and motioned for the Swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it.\"  She replied as she brought up the their profiles and hit the 'Accept' button.  She breathed a sight of relief when she saw her red hair flow back down in front of her eyes.  \"So you want to do this right?\"  She asked as she pressed the 'Accept' button.  Lilly didn't rally want to wait for her friend's permission.  SHE had the powerful device in her hand and SHE had the choice to pick what she wanted to.  As she pressed the button, there wasn't any fanfare that the swap had worked, instead it was almost as if she blinked and she was sitting in a different spot.  Looking around the room, she noticed that Ethan was still sitting next to her, but now he was wearing the clothes that she was wearing only seconds earlier.  The yellow T-shirt and tight jeans looked really odd on him, but not as odd as her curly red hair back on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we traded this back?\"  He groaned as he looked down is body.  It felt weird wearing Lilly's clothes, even more wearing her underwear.  He noticed that he was now holding the Swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we swapped lives, I think it gave us the hair too.\"  Lilly pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both heard a vibrating sound coming from one of their bags.  \"I think that one is yours.\"  Ethan pointed over at Lilly's, now his bag.  \"Should I answer it?\"  He asked and watched as Lilly nodded her head.  \"It's your Mom.\"  He hit the green button to accept the call.  \"Hello?\"  He paused for a moment and Lilly could tell that something was going on.  \"Okay, I'll be there in a minute.\"  He hung up the phone and looked back over at Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"  Lilly asked with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like I'm living your life.\"  Ethan sighed as he put the phone back into 'his' bag.  \"My name is Lilly and I need to go home to babysit Angela.\"  He picked up the Swapplet and started to put it also in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I keep it?\"  Lilly asked with a hopeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's mine and I don't want to take the chance to have stuff to be messed up when we swap back.\"  Ethan quickly answered as he waved her good bye and he headed over to Lilly's house.</span></div></div>",

Even though she lived a couple streets down from his house and he'd made the journey numerous times before, the wedge heeled sandals, that were now home on his feet, seemed to make the trip a bit more perilous.  With each step that he took, Ethan had to focus on not falling over and landing on the hard concrete.  He, honestly, thought about taking the sandals off and start walking to Lilly's home in his bare feet, but quickly thought against it when he saw several glass bottles broken on the side of the road and sidewalk.  Also, with each step that he took, Ethan could feel his longer hair bob and sway from side to side and the tight pants that Lilly wore today started to constrict his manhood.  \"I miss my own clothes.\"  Ethan grumbled to himself, but soon breathed a sigh of relief when he saw his destination.  Within his sight, a grey house with blue trim, namely Lilly's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\"  Alexandra Gordon waved as she saw Ethan coming up the sidewalk to their house.  \"I got a call to show the Anderson house to several families and I don't know when I'll be home, so you'll need to watch your sister.\"  She pulled the keys out of her purse and gave Ethan a quick peck on the cheek.  \"You're getting too tall, girl.\"  She sighed as she got in the car and started it up.  \"I left you some money to order a pizza and I will talk to you later.\"  Pulling out of the driveway, Alexandra waved to Ethan and soon was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Ethan turned and started to walk up the stairs to the front door.  Walking up the stairs, Ethan heard the front screen door shut and noticed that Angela stood there waiting her her 'sister' to get there.  \"It's about time you got here.\"  Angela replied as she went up to Ethan and gave him a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had always known that Lilly and Angela had been close and wondered why that was.  Was it because they were both girls and could relate to each other.  '<i>I guess I'll never really know</i>.'  Ethan thought to himself.  Ethan cleared his throat and looked down at his new sister.  \"So what do we want to do tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela stood there for a moment thinking about what she wanted to do.  \"How about we do what we did last time\"  She suggested as she started to pull a confused Ethan into the house.  Once inside the house, Ethan kicked off the sandals and continued to follow Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did we do last time?\"  Ethan asked, trying to get a clue at what she was talking about.  His confused look, seemed to please Angela and she giggled.  \"What?\"  He watched as Angela continued to giggle and didn't want to really think what Lilly and Angela were doing the last time that their Mom had to work late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to bake some cookies.\"  Angela shouted with excitement and clapped her hands.  Hearing this caused Ethan to breath a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>That's not too bad.</i>'  Ethan thought to himself as he followed Angela into the kitchen.  Putting Lilly's bag on the table, Ethan heard an odd thump but knew that it as the swapplet settling in the bag and didn't pay too much attention to it.  Remembering what his new Mom suggested what they do for dinner, Ethan looked over at Angela and suggested something.  \"So before we start making cookies, how about we go ahead and order dinner, hmm?\"  He watched as Angela nodded her head and Ethan pulled out his cellphone to dial the local pizza place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was ordering the pizza, Ethan was too occupied trying to decide what he wanted on his pizza to see what Angela was doing.  \"Wow, when did you get a tablet?\"  Angela exclaimed with excitement and Ethan put the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning back into the Dining Room where Ethan knew that's where he put the bag containing the swapplet.  \"Angela don't touch it.\"  He yelled with all his might, in an attempt to scare her from touching it.  As he turned the corner Ethan saw something what he didn't want to see.</span></div></div>",

Not falling for her tricks, Ethan stood defiant and asked again, in a much more forceful manner for the tablet.  \"I really need you to hand it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela looked at Ethan with her scheming eyes and then down at the swapplet in her hands  Pressing on the screen a couple times, she looked back up and smiled devilishly.  Ethan watched with amazement as he started to shrink and looking over at Angela, she started to grow.  Within a span of a few seconds, Ethan now had to look up to see Angela. \"Now I'm the babysitter.\"  Angela proudly proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"  Ethan asked looking down at himself and could see that he was still wearing Lilly's clothes, but had long, dark hair falling into his face, rather than the red, curly hair that he'd recently acquired from Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I swapped our hair.\"  Angela announced as she wrapped a couple strands of hair around her finger.  \"I have always loved your curly hair and wanted to try it out.\"  Then looking down at her own body.  Her body seemed to only changed a little with Ethan's old height of 6'1\".  \"I also swapped out our heights and our birthdays.  That way I get to be the babysitter and you get to be the little kid.\"  Ethan thought hard for his birthday and found that she was right.  The date that came to mind was November 11, 2009, that seemed correct, but he knew that was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change us back.\"  Ethan demanded, but found that his demand was falling on deaf ears.  He stomped on the floor with his foot in an attempt to make his point clear.  He looked around the room and saw his, or rather Lilly's, phone sitting on the counter.  As he saw his phone an idea came to mind.  \"If you don't change me back, how am I going to order the pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela thought for a moment and jumped up with a sense of joy.  \"I can do it.\"   She proudly proclaimed and quickly made her way over to the cell phone that was sitting on the counter.  Placing the swapplet on the counter next to her, Angela began to reach for the phone, but quickly thought against it.  She looked back over to Ethan and back to the swapplet.  \"But first, I think I need to put this up so that you can't reach it.\"   Ethan made a mad leap for the swapplet, but Angela had quickly scooped it up and placed it above the kitchen cabinets, where fake plants were sitting collecting dust.  She knew that at her old height, it would have been an almost impossible task for her to reach it and reveled with the fact that she was able to put something up there without much effort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at what she was able to accomplish, Angela grabbed the phone and the ad that was on the refrigerator.  Dialing the phone, she grinned devilishly as the boy on the other line called her '<i>Ma'am</i>'.  Seeing how much fun that Angela was having, Ethan knew that he had to try and reason with her.  \"Angela, please change me back, I don't want to be small.  I mean, what will my friends think about me?\"  Ethan asked, but knew what the answer would be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know they won't think anything about it.  Nicole will have always believed that you were that height and age.\"  Angela quickly pointed out as she put her hand over the microphone, in an attempt to silence her conversation with Ethan.  \"Or I could swap out are friends too, if you want?\"  Her smile grew tremendously as Ethan's eyes grew bigger.  \"That's what I thought, now be a good little girl and go play.  Hmm?\"  Letting out a frustrated sigh, Ethan knew that he would need to find a better way to combat this.  Ethan glumly walked up the stairs to Lilly's room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan had been countless of times to Lilly's room, so he knew where it was and what he had to expect. Nevertheless the room looked slighlty different from what he remembered, not because some furniture was moved or missing, but because of his reduced height. \"I really hate being so close\", he thought with a sigh as he closed his door. On closer inspection, he found some slight differences though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, in photos of Lilly he could now find himself with his black hair, reduced height and in the clothes and position Lilly had. Second, the DVD collection Lilly had was slightly altered to accommodate for his changed age. Gone were the more mature romance movies and the few action movies Lilly possessed, with some more children movies being in their stead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan slumped down on Lilly's bed which surprisingly enough did adjust for his height. \"Otherwise Angela would have trouble sleeping in her bed\", chuckled Ethan and began thinking about how to get the swapplet back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, Angela enjoyed her new height. She opened and closed the various cabinets she previously could not reach, placed objects on previously hard to reach places and laid down on the couch in her full length, noticing that it was now too small for her. The now big sister just wanted to get upstairs to make her new red hair, as she heard a ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had Ethan's phone with her downstairs and saw the caller ID of \"Ethan\". Angela took the phone and pondered whether she wanted to answer it or not, then decided with a shrug to go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ethan\", she greeted with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly who was on the other end of the lines was surprised that Angela answered the phone. As Lilly was registered in the swapplet, she was immune to the reality altering effect of the swapplet and therefore did not know that more swaps had taken place. All she knew was that Angela was her little sister who somehow answered Ethan's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, hi... Angela\", replied Lilly confused. \"I wanted to talk to Lilly... Is she there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ethan, Lilly's currently too busy playing\", answered Angela who enjoyed having the power to decide what her sister should do. She was the older one now, she could decide what they would do! \"I'll tell her that you called and she'll call you back before bed time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lilly could answer something, the line was cut. \"Bedtime?\", she asked herself in surprise. \"What did the idiot do now?!\". It had not even been an hour since the two departed and he was already either swapping himself with her sister or was in trouble. \"Probably the latter, otherwise he would have answered the phone himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly hurried out of Ethan's room and house, telling her \"mother\" on the way out that she had to borrow a book from Lilly for school, not even waiting for an reply, and ran as fast as she could to her old home.</span></div></div>",

With each step that she too, Lilly could feel her unrestrained breasts bouncing menacingly under her shirt.  But just thinking of what could have potentially happened to one of her friends, she did her best to ignore it.  \"She will call me back before bedtime?\"  Lilly replied to herself, trying to recall the conversation that she had with her sister earlier.  Just thinking about the potential problems that could have happened, caused her to run faster, harder, and ignore the pain from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin several minutes, Lilly was standing outside of her house.  She looked up at her room and noticed that the light was on, but she couldn't see Ethan's shadow or any other activity in the seemingly vacant room.  After standing there for a few minutes to catch her breath, Lilly was ready to see what kind of trouble that her friend had gotten into.  Just as she was about to walk up the dark walkway, Lilly could hear a bit of movement coming from her neighbor's house.  Looking over, she noticed that Mrs. Evans was taking out the trash.  Being such a petite woman, Samantha Evans had a hard time with the daily operations of keeping her house clean.  But with her husband being deployed overseas, somebody had to keep the house clean and tidy.  Lilly looked over through the window and saw her two children playing in the living room, a boy (7) and a girl (10).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Lilly, she waved her hand.  \"Hey there Ethan.\"  She greeted.  Lilly knew that Mrs. Evans has known Ethan for almost as long as they've been friends.  Lilly, not wanting to be rude, waved back and began to walk over to her.  \"Nice to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mrs. Evans.\"  Lilly replied back to her.  Standing there for a few minutes, Lilly decided to finally come out with it.  \"Have you noticed anything weird going on next door?\"  She motioned her head over to her own house.  Lilly knew that Mrs. Evans wouldn't notice anything odd, since she wasn't registered with the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really knowing what she was referring to, Mrs. Evan shook her head slightly, which caused her blonde hair to sway slightly.  \"The only thing that I've seen is a 17 year old man being friends with a 9 year old girl.\"  Lilly was taken aback at what was just said.  \"I know that the two of you go to the same school, but let her be a normal girl and have friends her own age.\"  With a slight huff, she turned and went back inside her own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\"  Lilly asked nobody in particular.  \"What does she mean being friends with a 9...\"  Saying out loud caused Lilly to finally put things together.  With a new vigor, she made her way over to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door, Lilly heard Angela cry out with excitement.  \"Yay...  Pizza's here.\"  Within a few seconds, Angela opened the door.  \"Oh, Ethan.\"  She exclaimed with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly stood there with a bit of shock at the sight in front of her.  She could see her sister, but she looked wrong.  Standing over 2 feet taller than her normal height and having her own red, curly hair, Angela almost didn't look like the same person.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lilly didn't want to take the chance that Angela knew about the mysterious device that Ethan had uncovered earlier that day.  But everything around her was pointing to the fact that something was out of place.  Not wanting to take the chance that her former sister had control of the swapplet, Lilly decided to play it safe.  \"Hey Angela, is Lilly here?\"  She asked, looking for a reason to see her friend and try to bring everything back to normal.  \"I need to borrow a book for school.\"  She then looked over at Angela who seemed to be thinking about what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Lilly is busy picking up her toys and I don't want her to be distracted.\"  Angela thought out loud to herself, still thinking that only she and her 'sister' were the only ones to know the power of the swapplet.  <br>\r\n\"But as long as you don't take too long, it should be fine.  I will give you a couple minutes.\"  She moved out of the way and allowed her former sister to get past.  As she passed by, Lilly couldn't help but marvel at how much taller she was now compared to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\"  Lilly replied walking up the stairs and noticed the pictures.  One had Ethan with Angela's long brown hair tied up in pigtails smiling a huge, toothy grin while holding up a sheet of paper with the logo of the school spelling bee.  The next one was of herself and Ethan at a birthday party.  He had on a poofy party dress that she'd hadn't worn since she was nine.  '<i>Who knew that my little sister would cause all of this.</i>'  She sighed as she walked towards her room and knocked on the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone, Angela.\"  Ethan cried out from the other side of the door.  Lilly began to open the door and noticed a much shorter Ethan picking up her room.  \"I'm almost done.  Oh my god, Lilly!\"  Ethan quickly made his way over to his friend and embraced her lovingly.  \"You shouldn't have come here.  Angela found the swapplet and gave me her height and age.\"  He replied looking up at his friend, who now stood 2 feet taller than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but we need to get it back, do you know what she did with it?\"  She asked looking for some answers in an attempt to get everything back to normal.  She watched Ethan think for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I remember is that she put it up above the cupboards in the kitchen and I can't reach it without help.\"  Ethan chimed in, thinking about a way to get the powerful object back.  \"And if I use the chairs, she will hear me.  And I don't know what else she will do to me.\"  He shuddered thinking about the other possible consequences that he might have to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you might not be able to reach it, but I might.\"  Lilly replied with a thrust of her chest in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that might just work.\"  Ethan answered back as he brought his long brown hair under control and put it behind his ear.  \"I can distract her and you can try to get it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here let me grab this book and I will leave.\"  Lilly grabbed a book and explained her plan.  Just make sure that the back door is unlocked and I will sneak back in while you keep her busy.\"  Ethan nodded his head as he agreed to the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly, the pizzas here!\"  Angela cried out from down stairs.  \"Ethan, its time for you to go so that we can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, knowing that it was now time to put their plan into action, without any more planning.  \"Okay, I'm on my way back down.\" She cried out to her former sister and her friend's tormentor.  She made her way down stairs and Ethan heard the door shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pizza is going to get cold.\"  Angela cried out again.  Taking a deep breath, Ethan made his way downstairs.</span></div></div>",

Angela had made herself comfortable in the living room, sitting on the ground besides the couch table and was already eating her piece of the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are\", she greeted him with a full mouth. \"Come on, get your pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan did as he was told, his glance wandered around the room. He could not find the swapplet lying around anywhere near the table, obviously since Angela did not want him to get it back. \"But this certainly helps. It's probably still hidden on the kitchen cupboard, which makes it easier for Lilly to find it\", he thought as he grabbed a slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you enjoying your new height?\", asked Ethan and tried to spark a conversation so Angela would not notice Lilly when she came in. The now tall girl was sitting with her back to the kitchen and the backdoor was not visible from the position the two were currently in, but Ethan wanted to be safe than sorry about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great\", smiled Angela. \"I can reach so many places. Your hair is also great, it suits me, right?\" She played with a strand of her hair and looked at Ethan. \"And not to mention that I am now the older sister. I'll never give that back!\" She laughed somewhat maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think so\", came a voice from behind her and Angela turned around surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan?\", she asked surprised when suddenly the changes started to happen, and Angela went back to her normal height and lost her red, curly hair in favour for her normal brown hair in pig-tails. It was not apparent, but she also got back her birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\", she screamed and jumped up, trying to get to who she thought was Ethan and get the swapplet back from him. Sadly, with her reduced height it was very easy for Lilly to hold the swapplet up high enough so that Angela could not reach it. \"Give it back! It is mine!\", screamed Angela again and again, tears forming in the corner of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan who was glad that he got his height back and somewhat indifferent for getting Lilly's hair back, stood up and walked over to Lilly. \"Thanks, you saved me\", he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I probably saved half the town. This thing is too dangerous to have a 9-year old use it\", replied Lilly and looked down at her sister, who had stopped trying to reach the swapplet and resorted to crying. It broke Lilly's heart to see her sister crying, but she knew that the two could not possibly leave the swapplet in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both are so mean\", sobbed Angela and hammered on Lilly's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, will ya?\", she said slightly annoyed to Angela, her sympathy vanished in that instant. She then turned her attention to Ethan. \"What do we do now? She knows about the swapplet, she is registered into the device. She'll know every future swap we'll make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded and crossed his arms in front of his chest, his face changing to a thinking expression. \"Nobody would believe her, but we have to keep it out of her reach for sure\", he mumbled lost in thoughts. \"Since I keep it, it shouldn't be a problem. The device would be in a different house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Angela look up and stop her crying. \"What do you mean? You live here\", she asked with an occasional swap in between the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job telling her\", hissed Lilly and then looked over to her sister. \"We both swapped lives earlier. I'm actually your sister and this 'girl' over there is actually Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela's eyes went wide in disbelieve. \"But you look like Ethan always did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, yes. It's the device that does it\", she explained but saw that her sister had a hard time wrapping her head around the matter. \"I think we should swap back for now, Ethan.\" Lilly then used the swapplet to reset the life swap that took place between her and Ethan. She soon found herself back in her own clothes, with her own hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? When are you going to swap back?\", asked Angela impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already did\", replied Lilly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently you only notice resets when you notice the swap\", concluded Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela raised an eyebrow and looked at the two. \"You're pranking me, right? You two did not swap lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan wanted to continue explaining the situation to Angela, but Lilly silenced him by shaking her head. Lilly, being back in her role as the older sister, thought about what to do with Angela now. Should they really withhold the swapplet from her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ethan\", she began. \"I've been thinking. Maybe we can let her use the swapplet. Wait, wait! Let me finish. We won't allow her to use it on her own, BUT we could talk to her about what she wanted to swap and then do the swap for her, if we approve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\", asked Ethan and looked at his crush and childhood friend. She did have a point, but he had wanted the swapplet to be a secret between him and her. With the cat out of the bag, it can never be a secret between just the two of them now, but did he really want to share this power with Lilly's sister?</span></div></div>",

It was then that Lily took the opportunity to start looking for the swapplet in the cabinets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it at?\"  She replied to herself as she looked through the different cabinets, taking great care to not make too much noise.  She didn't want to bring any attention to herself being in the kitchen, especially when Angela thought that 'Ethan' had already left to go back home.  After what seemed like forever, Lilly had looked through all of the cabinets and didn't find a thing, not even something resembling the swapplet.  Closing the final cabinet, Lilly lost control of it and soon heard it slam shut.  \"Shit.\"  She muttered to herself as she looked for a place to hide and quickly made her way to the pantry, where she would be able to hide herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I heard it in here.\"  Lilly could hear Angela saying muffled through the door.  Lilly could feel her heart rate going through the roof at being discovered, but did her best to control her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably nothing, Angela.\"  Ethan replied, trying to get her to come with hi back to the table to eat.  Also to give Lilly some extra time to continue her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I think you're right.\"  Angela chuckled as she gently patted Ethan's hair, much to his disapproval.  \"I'm going to go use the potty real fast and you can go back to eating, alright kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Okay.\"  Ethan quickly replied with a hidden smile on his face.  He waited until Angela could be heard going back up the stairs before letting Lilly know that she could come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one.\"  Lilly sighed with exasperation as she climbed out of the pantry to see the much smaller Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find it?\"  Ethan asked with a bit of delight in voice.  Lilly couldn't help but giggle as he bounced up and down with the prospect of getting back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think it's in here.\"  She replied with a look of disappointment on her face.  \"I mean, I looked through all of the cabinets and nothing that resembles the swapplet is in here.\"  She could tell that Ethan was not as giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan then pointed to the tops of the cabinets where an odd arrangement of knickknacks and fake plants covered with a light layer of dust on the plastic leaves.  \"What about up there?\"  But quickly thinking, he shook his head in knowing that even with his height, it would take several minutes to get it.  \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did she hide the damn thing?\"  Lilly asked not caring that she just cursed in her own home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hid it in my room.\"  Angela replied from around the dining room.  Both Lilly and Ethan quickly made their way to the dining room to see Angela sitting at the head of the table with the swapplet in her hands.  As they crossed the threshold to the room, Ethan could see that Lilly was no longer over 2 feet taller than him, but now only a half a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"  Lilly quickly asked as she looked over at Ethan, who was also at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just making some changes so that you can't get the swapplet.\"  Angela giggled to her self as she was continuing to type something into the odd device.  Ethan looked back over at Lilly and in an instant noticed that a young girl had taken her spot.  She looked to be around the same age as Angela, but now had his short blond hair and stood at his normal height of 6' 1\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"  Ethan demanded as he looked back over to Angela who seemed to be proud of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, I think it's time for you to go home.\"  Angela replied to the young girl.  \"Lilly needs to get ready for bed\"  Almost as if on autopilot, 'Ethan' turned to him and waved good bye.  When they heard the door close, Angela told her 'sister' what had happened.  \"You see Lilly.  I couldn't have your friend ruining my fun, so I swapped him with the little girl next door.\"  Ethan could feel his jaw drop as Angela just burst out in a fit of laughter.  \"Just thinking of him having to wear her skirts is just hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this to us.\"  Ethan yelled at her.  \"You can't just toy with our lives like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I can.\"  Angela replied with a devilish grin.  \"And if you don't play nicely, I might swap you with the little boy over there.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lilly didn't know what was going on, one minute she was standing next to Ethan and the next she was on a swing.  Looking down at her body, she could see herself wearing a pair of yoga pants that were mostly white and blue with butterflies on it.  Slowing down the swinging motion, Lilly made sure not to fly off the swing by holding on tight to the chain.  When she stopped, Lilly was able to get a better look at her body.  Hopping off of the playground equipment, she noticed a pink T-shirt with the phrase 'Girlz Rule!!' written with glitter.  \"Abigail?\"  A female's voice called out from behind her.  \"Are you okay sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly quickly turned around and watched her newly acquired brown hair fly around her head only to see her neighbor, Mrs. Evans, sitting on the porch with what looked like a book.  She seemed to be concerned about her as she put down her book.  \"Umm... Yeah, I'm fine.\"  She replied, which seemed to put Mrs. Evans at ease and she picked back up her book.  \"She must have swapped me with Abbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly remembered the two kids that lived next door, Abbie and William.  They were both sweet kids and she had to babysit them several times.  Now it looks like she was now Abbie.  \"Great.\"  She complained to herself.  \"This is what I get for helping Etha.\"  She sighed as she looked around her.  Lilly found that she seemed to be in the back yard.  It was neatly trimmed and well manicured and nothing seemed to be out of place.  From all the times that she'd seen it in the past, nothing seemed to be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Abbie!\"  William called out to her.  \"Push me now.  It's my turn.\"  Lilly nodded her head and did her best to help William into the seat and started to push him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>***   Meanwhile Next Door   ***</b></div><br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\"  Ethan asked from the top of the stairs again, trying to get answers.  He did his best to tread lightly and not to make Angela too mad.  He decided to bide his time and wait for the right moment to get back the swapplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he knew too much Lilly.\"  Angela replied with an intimidating laugh.  \"And I can't have him messing up everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he's not going to win this fight right now, Ethan groaned and went back to Lilly's bedroom and noticed something that was out of place.  Normally Lilly had a television, books, and magazines in her room with several posters on the wall of various guys in a certain state of undress.  This always made Ethan feel odd and out of place.  But now instead of the normal things that a teenage girl would normally have, Ethan found numerous dolls, stuffed animals, and childish board games.  \"God damn it Angela.\"  Ethan muttered under his breath.  He then made his way over to the window where he heard a couple kids playing outside.  Looking out he was able to see Lilly pushing a little boy on a swing while looking around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan stood by the door, carefully listening to see where Angela was so that he could make an exit to go talk to Lilly.  After several minutes of waiting, he finally was able to hear a door close and the toilet seat hitting the back of the commode.  He knew that this was his chance, Ethan slowly closed the door and quickly, yet quietly, made his way down stairs.  As he made it to the back door, Ethan felt out of breath and realized that he hadn't taken a breath since leaving the room.  Slowly he unlocked the back door and quietly made his way outside.  The crackling of the grass beneath his feet let him know that he was walking on eggshells with Angela.  If he was caught, what would she do to him.  He shook his head and felt his new pig tails hit his head.  Careful not to get caught, Ethan tried his best to stay out of sight of the windows and finally made his way to the fence.  \"Lilly.\"  He quietly called out hoping that she would hear him.  Putting his eye in a knot of one of the boards, Ethan was able to see his friend/crush looking around to see where her 'real' name was being called from.  \"Over here.\"  Ethan called out with a little more force and sticking his hand through the knot in an attempt to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan?\"  Lilly cried out and quickly running over to him to talk.  \"I'm so glad to see you.  Angela swapped me with Abbie and now she's you.\"  Ethan could tell that she was on the verge of crying and tried his best to console her but could only do so much through the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\"  Ethan replied though the fence.  \"From what I saw, she believes that she's me and won't do anything too bad.  But as for Angela, what do you think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\"  Lilly replied in between sobs.  \"I don't know.  She's so much taller than us now and I don't know what she will do to us.\"  With her diminished height and abruptly switching her life with the little girl next door seemed to be too much for her and she broke down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down and think.\"  Ethan consoled, trying to keep a level head.  \"I think that she will put it down at night and all we have to do is find it, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, you're right.\"  Lilly acknowledged, having stopped the sobbing and seemingly getting it together.  \"We need more time to think and make a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think I can be in there with those dolls tonight.\"  He replied and shuddered at the thought of it.  \"You don't know how much they give me the creeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.\"  Lilly cut in.  \"I don't have any of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Creeps?\"  Ethan asked not truly understanding where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly.\"  Lilly chuckled at what was just said.  \"Dolls.  I got rid of all my dolls a couple years ago.  As a matter of fact, Angela has most of them.  So it can't be mine.\"  She crossed her arms under her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes and no.\"  Ethan corrected thinking back to the poster of blonde-haired girl with the large pink bow smiling down that was now on Lilly's wall.  \"I think she swapped out her stuff for yours, or at least that's what I think happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little...\"  She bit her tongue before she said something that she would regret.  \"I swear when I get my hands on her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Lilly heard something behind her, turning around she found her new Mom standing nearby.  \"Abbie, who are you talking to?\"  Getting closer, she stood right next to Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\"  Ethan replied, not really remembering her name and didn't want to be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that you Lilly?\"  Mrs. Evans called out trying to look over the fence but found it too high to do so.  Instead she attempted to look in between the boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\"  Ethan called out making his presence known, or rather the life that he was currently living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while sweetie.\"  Mrs. Evans gushed.  \"How is your Mom doing?  I never really get to see her with her crazy schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's doing good.\"  Ethan replied thinking of Lilly's Mom.  \"She's showing a house right now and won't be back until later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad.\"  Mrs. Evans replied sounding a little down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a light bulb went off above Lilly's head, she had an idea.  \"Mom.\"  She turned her head to meet her gaze.  \"Would it be alright if Lilly stays the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know.\"  Mrs. Evans answered back, seemingly sitting on the figurative fence.  \"You know what, I think it's about time you two became friends.  I don't know why I hadn't done it sooner?\"  She chirped, getting out her phone to call Lilly's Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>It's probably because we're all messed up.</i>'  Lilly thought to herself as she smiled.</span></div></div>",

She shook her head as she thought about how complicated this all was.  All because her idiot friend didn't trust her with the swapplet.  Lilly looked over at Ethan and couldn't help but stifle a giggle at the way he looked.  With Angela's long, brown hair tied up in pig tails, Ethan looked pretty cute.  \"What are you giggling at?\"  Ethan asked as he looked up slightly to meet Lilly's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\"  Lilly replied as she leaned over slightly to tell him something.  \"I just think you look cute with long hair.\"  She smiled once again as she watched him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's great.\"  Mrs. Evans said into her phone as she continued to talk to Lilly's Mom.  She then turned to look at Ethan and Lilly, giving them both a thumbs up.  \"Ok, I will send her over to get her clothes now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked up at Mrs. Evans with a mixture of horror and elation.  Horror, because that meant that he would need to go back inside to get some clothes, and Elation for knowing that they would have some time alone to talk about how to get the swapplet back.  Almost knowing what Ethan was thinking and remembering what Mrs. Evans told her the other day, Lilly spoke up.  \"I think we have some clothes that we were wanting to give to her anyway, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?  You're right Abbie.\"  She responded as she placed her hand on Lilly's head with endearment.  \"Come on over and I will send a text over to Alexandra letting her know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lilly.\"  Lilly replied grabbing Ethan's hand and leading him over to the place he will be staying for the night.  \"We have stuff to do.\"  Mrs. Evan's quickly sent the text over to Lilly's Mom about the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew minutes later, Lilly practically dragged Ethan to the room that they will be staying for the night.  \"Wait, how did you know where they sleep.\"  Ethan wondered out loud, paranoid that Angela swapped something else out between Abbie and Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly just looked at Ethan and tried to play along, but quickly knew that she wouldn't be able to pull it off.  \"No it's nothing like that.\"  Giggling, she leaned in and playfully nudged him.  \"I've babysat them in the past and I pretty much know the layout of the house.\"  She looked over at Ethan and was glad that they were alone so that they could talk about what to do.  \"Speaking of the swapplet, what are we going to do with Angela?  With her having the device, she is too powerful.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sat down for a moment to think about what they were going to do.  \"Well, we could try and sneak in there tonight.\"  He suggested to her, but soon found her shaking her head.  \"What?  Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one, you don't have your key with you.\"  Lilly motioned down to his body and he knew that she was right.  \"And two, if we try to do something like that she will be expecting it.  I mean, just think how far ahead of us she was before.\"  She watched as Ethan shook his head, clearly not wanting to remember what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\"  Ethan asked as he jumped up on Abbie's bed to sit down, letting out a long drawn out sigh when he realized that his feet wasn't touching the ground.  \"Don't you guys have a 'Hide-a-key' fake rock or anything?\"  He thought back to his Grandparent's house and the time when his Grandma locked her keys in the house and needed to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I do believe Mrs. Evans has a spare.\"  Lilly replied with grin.  \"If we can find out where she keeps it, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan, really excited about getting the swapplet back and being himself once again, completed her thought for her.  \"We can get back to normal.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking at him with his hair in long pig tails, that her sister loves to have, caused some erotic thought to go through her own head.  She shook her head to free herself of these thoughts and could tell that Ethan didn't know what she was talking about.  She let out a chuckle as she playfully nudged him.  \"You've never really seen the big picture.  The key is what's holding this plan together and without it we can't get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I know that.\"  Ethan chuckled, trying his best not to seem too dense.  \"So do you think she has a key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my Mom gave it to her just in case something happened and she needed to get over there.\"  Lilly explained as she started to get up and found a surprise as she didn't anticipate.  It seems that she still wasn't used to her diminished height and found the jump down to take more time than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out there, the first step is a doozy.\"  Ethan quipped as he hopped down off the bed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk, short stuff.\"  She quipped back as she made he way towards the door.  \"Come on and let's go ask.\"  Ethan nodded and followed her down stairs to learn their fate.  Within several minutes they both stood in the kitchen, where Mrs. Elizabeth Evans was busy getting dinner put together for the four of them.  \"Umm... Mom.\"  Lilly started but found it to be a little odd calling her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sweetie?\"  Elizabeth answered back as she put down the knife that she was using to prepare the salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a key that Lilly can use to go get her favorite game that we can play?  Her sister had to go do something and we don't know how long her Mom is going to be until she gets back.\"  Elizabeth stood there for a moment thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Alex did give me one several years ago when you guys went on vacation, but I don't know if I still have it.\"  Elizabeth looked over to Ethan.  \"Lilly, sweetie, are you sure it can't wait until your Mom gets home?\"  Ethan shrugged his shoulders.  Letting out a sigh, Elizabeth made her way over to the key rack next to the back door to see if she could find the key that could potentially lead to their freedom and back to their own lives. \"Sorry, dear, but I don't see it.\"  She turned back around and looked back at the two of them.  \"I remember that it had an uppercase G and that's how I knew that it was to your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched at their hearts sank with the news.  \"Oh, okay.\"  Ethan replied back to her as he followed Lilly back up to Abbie's room for them to wait for Lilly's Mom to get home or for them to be called won for dinner.  \"It has to be Angela.\"  Ethan replied with scowl on his face.  \"I know it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I doubt that.\"  Lilly replied with a grin.  \"She's 9 years old.\"  Looking over at Ethan, who now had her age and height to go along with her hair.  \"Well, mentally, she's 9 years old and I don't think she is going to have this all planned out.  I mean, for God's sake, my Mom has to gripe at her to brush her teeth right before bed.  So I don't think she is going to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan held up his hand to stop her.  \"Yeah, I'm sorry for saying that.  I'm just tired of being you and being this small.\"  He huffed, trying his best to mend any burned bridges that the sudden outburst may have caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, but there could be another thing that we can do.\"  Lilly sighed thinking about what would be the probable outcome and how Ethan wouldn't like it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked back over to her.  \"And what would that be?\"  He asked, not really wanting to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might need to bargain with her to get it back.\"  Lilly sighed, not liking the outcome too much either.  Ethan seemed not to like this revelation too and started to object.  \"I know, I know.\"  She replied, trying to calm him down a little.  \"But if all she wants is to be a little taller and maybe a little older, then what are we to do but stop her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want you to be stuck with her age.\"  Ethan replied, but found Lilly smiling.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find it sweet that your thinking of me.\"  She smiled over at Ethan.  \"But no, I say that we find somebody that is a little older than her and nobody will be none the wiser.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at his friend with a bit of awe.  In this seemingly short amount of time, Lilly was able to plan this all out with little help from him.  \"This why I love you.\"  He hugged her and realized what he said and pulled away, blushing ferociously.   \"Sorry, I didn't mean for that to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize, but I think all that can wait for tomorrow.\"  She pointed out as she opened up Abbie's room.  \"But for right now, I think we should enjoy being younger.\"  She began to giggle.  \"From what I hear, you're only young once.\"</span></div></div>",

She thought herself as a better big sister than Lily had ever been. She was sitting on the couch watching a movie that her Mom would never allow her to normally watch. She was indeed in heaven when she heard the front door unlock and the keys jingling as they were laid on the table next to the door. \"Honey, I'm home.\" Alexandra called out to the seemingly empty home. She turned the corner to see Angela sitting on the couch with her feet on the couch watching a movie.  \"Young lady!\"  She exclaimed as she put her hands on her hips.  \"You know better than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela quickly turned the channel in an attempt to hide the evidence from her Mom.  \"Oh hey Mom, you're home early.\"  She turned around to see her Mom with a hint of disappointment on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you not to put your feet on the sofa?\"  Alexandra sighed as she picked up Angela's feet and gently tossed them off the couch towards the floor.  She then looked over at her and wondering if she knew about her little sister not being here.  \"How is your little sister doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  Angela quickly replied with a proud tone in her voice, finally being seen as the big sister.  \"She's up in her room right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really.\"  Alexandra chuckled slightly under her breath.  \"Then why did I get a phone call from Mrs. Evans asking if Lilly can stay the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I sent her to her room earlier.\"  Angela replied as she quickly got up and soon found herself standing 7 inches taller than her Mom.  \"That little brat is going to pay.\"  She mumbled under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good.\"  Alexandra replied.  \"You know, I'm actually kind of glad that she's making friends her own age.  I mean, I don't know why she's friends with Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela giggled, thinking of Lilly's friend, Ethan, having to live as the 10 year old girl that lived next door.  She thought for a moment on whether or not she wanted to punish her sister, but decided against it.  She had to come home some time and that's when she would act.  \"So she's alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's having a sleep over with Abigail.\"  Alexandra answered.  \"So if it's just going to be us tonight, how about we go check out a movie and have a night out?  I mean, it's been forever since its been just us.\"  Angela, still having the excitement of a 9 year old, jumped at the chance to go somewhere interesting with her Mom.  She was so excited that she left the swapplet unattended on the grey sectional that wrapped around the room.  The two of them silently made their way out of the house and into the minivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext door sitting in the kitchen, Ethan watched with disbelief as Angela and Mrs. Gordon piling into their minivan and backing out of the driveway.  Turning to Lilly, he whispered in her ear.  \"Your Mom and sister are leaving, so now is our chance to get the swapplet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but how are we going to get inside?\"  Lilly whispered back, trying not to cause any attention being brought to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can still go look to see if we can get in, right?\"  Ethan suggested with a smirk and a wink.</span></div></div>",
