I ended up a year later going back to school...this time to a technical institute called ITT.  I went to study Computer-Aided Drafting and Design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer program of use was AutoCad.  We learned how to use the program for Mechanical, Civil, Architectual, and Electrical drafting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally I had thought I wanted to do Architectual, but soon found out I didn't like it.  I preferred Mechanical or Civil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now work in the Civil Engineering field as a Engineering Technician (CAD Drafter is what it is often called).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have worked in private companies, with strict deadlines and having to account for every second of time...thankfully I now work for the City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere at the City, things are relaxed and deadlines are approximate (for the most part).  My job involves using AutoCad to draw out construction plans for sidewalks, streets and underground pipes for water and wastewater.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also use ArcView GIS to draw exhibits for City Council meetings or other meetings, or to just gather needed information.  GIS is a Geographical program.  I use the bare bones of it in my profession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy job is not stressful at all...not working for the City, at least.  The Engineers I work with (yes, you work directly with Engineers) are all nice...quirkly but nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the private sector I had to deal with a lot of crap.  Pushy, demanding Engineers who had no concept of how long it would take to do a job, always wanting it \"yesterday.\"  If something wasn't right, they'd often lay into you, even if it wasn't your fault.  Deadlines were very strict (sometimes unreasonable) and overtime was common when on a tight deadline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvertime is unheard of here at the City.  5:01pm and it's a ghost town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis occupation is not as artistic as it may seem.  Civil Engineering doesn't allow a lot of room for creativity.  It's more techincal and mathematical, therefore for the creative mind can get highly monotinous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis occupation is great for analytical minds.  Close attention to detail is needed.  Being able to communicate well is essential, because frankly, many engineers are so technically minded they don't communicate well.  Sometimes you have to be a mind reader.  You have to have a good sense of balancing your time and meeting deadlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not good at math, but it certainley helps to be in this profession.  But, I get along fine (caresses calculator).  I've had to use elements of Geometry and Trigonometry and yes, even Algebra...thankfully not too much.  Mostly though, the Engineers do all the math.  As long as you type in the right numbers into the computer, you should be fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part of my job is that I don't often have to go outside (it's hot here in Texas).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part of my job is that it gets old after a while.  Monotonous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was so sure of myself and my career that many people I spoke with assumed that I thought I was about greatness.  I had my heart broken, although.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I was full of confidence after hands on training or really practical experience, I was surely hitting the ground running.  I was titled the storeroom manager and was also responsible for other department managers roles including the sales floor and front end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy days averaged between 9-10 hrs. of more likely competent performance and often days I was busy enough to bring home work assignments to detail my department employees for major and minor projects when I was days off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was proud to have the receiving managers duties because I was effective at assigning my staff of workers proper instructions in all frailty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would supervise the loading and unloading of the Toys R Us trailers and per the corporate headquarters and labor projections and standards.  I would record the amounts of Return goods Defective and calculate the totals of pilferage like a Inventory manager and specialist.  I would often times require policy for customer complaints or customer refunds and would be of professional tact.  I could have numerous big ticket displays that surely would have to be stocked and I could say that the sales floor manager and I would have to coordinate successfully to make a balance of good on the sales floor and in the storeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of an evening, I would be responsible for store closure and that involved the assisting of the front end manager while counting down cashier money tills.  Often times there were only 2 managers working at one time and it was really satisfying work. But no one told me much about this professions flaws.  I had to learn through harder knocks but you have many discussions paved brightly for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

True enough, on paper I am a full-time student on the cusp of graduation and I hope in the future to have a job as a humble librarian paired with a wildly successful career in published authorship. Both of these paths, regrettably, are still in those initial stages of pure potential. After earning my achingly dilatory bachelor's degree in academic nonsense I intend to take a scholastic sabbatical to sharpen my writer's pencil before moving on to librarian school for the stable-income career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right at this moment I am what I have always been, a dreamer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the time I was a little girl I have gathered images, daydreams and stories in my little cranium to entertain myself with, and entertain I did. My stories and dreams were more often than not more engrossing than what the television could offer and I was often my own best conversation. I wasn't a crazy child, by any medicinal means anyway, but I wasn't a social child either. It wouldn't be a severe exaggeration to say that I spent most of my life inside my own imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I am a grown-up, complete with a marriage, a mortgage, and soon a higher-education degree to boot. I somehow, somewhere became a member of the responsible-adult club in all of the chaos of the world. But I still have my dreams. In fact, they are still better than television most of the time. Perhaps that is why I feel the strong drive to become a writer, to let loose my imagination after a lifetime of unjust imprisonment. This is not as easily said than done. Confident communication is not a my strong suit; my imagination has been my own private world for as long as I could remember and exposing it to the world has proven itself as much a challenge as walking out the front door naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that is why I am here. These are the first steps to breaking out of my shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may be a student now and a librarian in the future, but how I occupy myself is through fine-tuning my stories and my dreams. I intend to make these dreams meaningful through the art of language, through honing my skills as a reputable writer. Maybe the next time I come across the career question I can fill in the blank as a flourishing novelist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFin.&lt;/font&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My phone starts ringing- damn i was supposed to go to the clinic today. I'm a second year veterinary student and i work part time at a vet clinic some few blocks from school. Life's tough my results in the previous exams have not been that good and I've got to nail this if i want to get that scholarship. <br>\r\nThis semester is supposed to be the simplest-or so i've heard- though i doubt any of the other students have tried to work as they study. I have six units and i have to attain a minimum of 50% to proceed to the next class. Microbiology is a bitch but i guess i'll get used to it once i work on my fear of microbes.<br>\r\nWe have classes all everyday from 8.00 - 5.00p.m. except for Wednesday afternoon which is when the board meets. Since skiving classes is a sin punishable by everlasting fire i work weekends and Wednesday afternoons. The pay is not that good considering I've got to wipe dog poop and deal with hysteric clients. I assist in surgery on some days and its almost the only fun thing i ever get to do. The rest consists of putting pills in bottles which is boring and really tiring,giving injections-patients in this case won't just sit there as you poke them-, preparing the animals for surgery and ensuring that all animals left at the clinic for boarding are well fed. I love animals and i hope when i finally graduate I'll be the best doctor ever, its a fun profession but it gets lonely sometimes........</span></div></div>",

Eating out of parents pocket, staying home rent-free with both parents while waiting for interview/application results is hardly worth writing about. In the meantime I am working as a part-time teacher at a preschool and volunteering at a nearby special children center. During my studying days, I wake up at 4 am. Five months later, that habit is non-existent--I now wake up four hours later. Doesn't take much for good habits that takes years to build to be lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuesdays and Thursdays are preschool days. I don't have to prepare much lesson plans for four-years old kids as they don't demand much to keep them happy and are easily impressed. Hah, that's what I thought at first. Turns out these kids are a handful, bunch of pettiness and cute tattletalers who are also attention-seeking. I was flattered when I suddenly become the most popular teacher, but then the novelty wears off. I loses my shininess and also my voice after they realize they could bully the nice cute teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teach them to sing songs, write words, flashcards, and generally repeat everything again. Repetitive is the key to success when teaching four-years olds. Interesting thing that had happen during all this time? I am not sure if peeing in class is a normal occurance in normal preschool, but twice I had to go through the horror of having someone clean up the mess. Then once I got punch in the lips by this little girl who brings out the shivers in me. She was standing on top of the table, and I was trying to get her to come down. In the process, her swinging arms connected with my face and brought blood to my lips. Viciousness. But of course, as their very loving and patient teacher, not! I still love them all very much, because God made them to be the sweetest thing in the world so much so that when they smile and ask for a hug, everything is forgiven. That's why it's impossible to hold a grudge against a child, designed the way they are, angelic even if they can act like monsters, I can't help but be charmed. Aww..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMondays and Fridays I go to a center for special needs children which can recommended by a teacher friend who thought that it would be a good experience for me. She was right, I really learned a lot. I met so many children who despite their disabilities, are educable and brings the most genuine smile to my face. Their happiness are infectious and contagious. The teachers there are very good at their jobs, they make their own worksheets and teaching aids. I just help to clean up stuff and keep materials used, prompting the kids when they are stuck with their works and mostly having fun with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife after hundreds of hours studying is comparably easy now..Where next is all a matter of opportunities and my calling in life.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I just can't stand the idea of a \"normal\" relationship. A real one on one deal, now that is something I have never experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost days I can sleep in as late as I like. Except the days that HE comes over. My life revolves around HIM, see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes I resent that. I resent the fact that I can't take care of myself. Or rather, I can't take care of myself per the standard of living that I have grown accustomed to. The standard that HE introduced me to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could move out of the house he bought for me. With its 4 bedrooms and big kitchen and nice furniture. I could move out and start over. But where would I go? The likely answer is that I would just run into someone else's arms. Once you're trained to be a mistress...you really don't un-learn that sort of thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHE comes over every day. Depending on HIS work schedule. Actually we spend most of the day together. We do everything normal couples do. We go grocery shopping, we pay bills, I make HIM lunch. Its really nice to be able to go into the grocery store and not worry about the price of things. Just see it. Like it. Get it. I suppose thats how it was when HE saw me. I remember a time, before I met HIM, when I had to worry about things like that. It wasn't much fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spend about 2 hours a day at the gym. Looking good is basically my bread and butter. I know all the machines. I know them as well as I know every measured inch of my body. Every curve, every striation. I created it. I used to be kinda plump until I came down this road. No one would call me plump now. Everyone at the gym knows me. They smile when they see me. I'm that sweet, young girl who seems to be doing so well for herself. So established and together. I get a lot of compliments on that. On how \"together\" I am. If they only knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am also a student. I go to college full time. A journalism and public communications major. I could be the girl who delivers you the news. If I didn't have school I don't know what I'd do. HE doesn't want me to work...and having a social life is pretty tough when your a mistress. It gets pretty lonely. And boring. Funny how people don't really want to be friends with someone--well someone like me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as the other woman. No, she doesn't know about me. This has been going on for 5 years. I don't know how she can NOT know...maybe she does and she just doesn't mind. We all have levels of what is acceptable. Maybe I am a necessary evil to her. I don't know. Its not my business to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo is being a mistress an occupation? Probably depends on the situation. To me it is. I don't plan on doing this forever. I have dreams of my own. Or I did once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job description....be a mirror. Be an idea. Be engaging. Be charming. Be disarming. Be funny. Be beautiful. Be a tailored definition of perfect for your audience. Do all these things and more. Do it with a smile on your face. And don't ever let that mirror crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk about a consuming job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a proud moment for me the first day I attended classes in college September of 1956 after graduating from Modesto High School. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege graduation at Fresno State College that June 1960 was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I proudly accepted my Bachelor's Degree which prepared me for teaching English, Writing, History and Social Studies. Those were my favorite high school courses so I thought it would be great to teach those subjects to high school and junior high students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contract I signed with Ceres, California School District said that all of my classes but one would be eighth grade Creative Writing and one seventh grade math class. I developed the curriculum for Creative Writing and during the year and my students produced some wonderful poems and essays. I loved teaching the classes and watching the least capable among them become creative writers. I still have some of their writings which I read again recently. To this day, I think the District should never have employed a math teacher who had not studied how to teach math. While I did my best to teach my math students, I have always thought they were cheated by the District for requiring a non-math teacher to hold them hostage an hour a day. The students deserved a teacher trained in the art of teaching math, not a teacher who knew her math very well but had no training in teaching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter teaching for several years, I changed vocations and became the Volunteer Director at the Idaho State School and Hospital for the intellectually disabled. That was 1969 and I quickly fell in love with the accomplishments that I could cause by doing the statewide job I had accepted. One goal was to teach people all over the state to stop using words like 'idiot, imbecile, moron, mongoloid and worse' names. At that time, the words 'mentally retarded' was the most respectable term we wanted people to use. At the same time, the job included recruiting and training ordinary people and students of all ages to visit the institutional home of over four hundred individuals and make personal contributions to their lives. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with that job and the wonderful volunteers who gave of themselves to help individuals who just wanted a friend. I worked with women who were community leaders to raise funds and build the All Faiths Chapel at the in<br>\r\nstitution which today, years later, serves less than two hundred residents and patients, most of whom can't understand religion; but, I believe they know God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose experiences and others led me to accept the position of Development Director, a fund raiser, to raise money for hospitals and other nonprofit activities. My years of fund development led to raising over six million dollars for my organizations. I developed the Fund Development Program at Mercy Medical Center, Nampa, Idaho, by making speeches to all community groups in the area while designing and implementing a Direct Mail program for sending those 'infernal' letters asking for donations that every resident in America receives from charitable organizations. It takes a heart and skill to write those letters in a way that leads thousands of people to write checks and give their money for the benefit of someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevelopment Directors like me, learn how to plan and implement fund raising events and activities that are so much fun that people give money to the charity. The primary part of such events was the recruitment of community leaders and other talented and interested people to serve on the planning committee. For the Annual Tennis Tournament which lasted more than ten years, I recruited five tennis players who served as the planning committee all of those years. They included an insurance agent, an intensive care nurse, a school librarian, a cardiologist and a banker. My job was to guide and serve them and 'pick up the pieces', the tasks that made their work successful. I also created an annual Golf Tournament that still continues to be one of the best in the state. For another hospital where I was Foundation Fund Development Director, I created the Festival of Trees which raised twenty-eight thousand dollars the first year and over a hundred thousand its fifth year. Aga<br>\r\nin, the creation and serving of a community committee was the basis of the success. An Annual Gin Rummy Tournament was a huge success at one medical center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFund Development Directors must find ways to develop long term donors. With that focus, I met with individuals, wrote letters, promoted the charity through a newsletter, produced brochures and designed donor recognition methods. Each day, I made personal or mailing contacts to donors and potential donors who were individuals, business leaders, ordinary individuals and a variety of organizations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResearching sources of major funding was always important in my work of raising money for charitable organizations. Not only did I learn how to and successfully wrote grant proposals that were funded by Foundations, Corporations, state and federal government, but I developed training programs on the \"how to\" of fundraising and grant writing so that others could learn. Even though they competed with me in fundraising and writing grant proposals, there was always money for all of us if we wrote quality grant requests. I became called \"the Dean of Fundraising\" in Idaho during those years because I shared my knowledge and success with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an ordinary day in life as a Fund Development Director, I would meet with one or more staff members, meet with the Board of Directors or the Management Team, write 'thank you' letters, make telephone calls and keep appointments, edit and publish newsletters, write grant proposals to Foundations and Corporations or government sources, meet with volunteers to plan events, oversee office activities and supervise staff, while always focusing on progress and growth for creating new ways to raise money for the clients of the charitable organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, besides raising those six million dollars, I set into play hundreds of activities and recruited hundreds of volunteers and donors to continue the work after I left so I choose to take credit for the fundraising work that transpired for the benefit of the deserving clients of each organization even after I moved on and retired. I am proud of every volunteer I recruited, every grant proposal I wrote, every dollar raised and every friend gained for the organizations and their clientele whom I served 1969 to 1999. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work was a challenge and I am blessed.</span></div></div>",

Yes, I am crazy, but not as crazy as my schedule is now. My job as a journalist consists of researching my subject, putting together interviews, interviewing people, writing articles, editing articles, taking photos to add to the articles, and making sure that nobody is offended. Fun stuff. Its a difficult schedule, and if you like a lot of free time, I don't recommend it. Still, I needed to figure out if journalism is my calling. I'm still not sure, but hopefully the answer will become clearer as the year goes by. Besides...it looks great on my resume ^_^</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I teach high school English.  This is a job in which there is a great amount of preparation, such as writing lesson plans, reading all assigned reading for students, and gathering materials for each lesson.  All assignments that students complete, whether in class or homework, must be graded as promptly as possible so that students receive feedback.  Teachers must also plan for discipline issues--you should know what to do if and when a student misbehaves or disrupts class, as any disruptions interfere with student learning.  Sometimes there are students with special needs, so the teacher must keep an eye out for these students especially, though all students need to be observed for understanding of the lesson.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA typical day is packed full of five classes, which is a normal teaching load, and any other duties that may be assigned.  Teachers are often assigned duties such as monitoring a study hall, lunch duty, hall duty, etc.  in addition to teaching.  Teachers are supposed to have one period for planning, in which no other duties would be assigned, though occasionally there is an emergency need for a teacher to substitute for another teacher if there is no other sub available.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrive at work a half hour before school begins, and I set up my room for the day by writing information or objectives for the day on the board, making sure I have all materials, copies of assignment sheets, etc., whatever is needed for the day.  I have my list of students and seating chart for each class on my podium so that I can check attendance quickly at the beginning of class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class begins, I am responsible for taking accurate attendance within the first five minutes of the period.  My school uses a computer program to submit attendance, so I check the seating chart right when the bell rings, and it is essential that all students are in their seats.  Students not in their seats are tardy, if they show up to class at all.  I usually have bell work, a short assignment, ready for students to complete, while I go to my computer, enter attendance, and submit it.  Any students wandering in late must bring a tardy slip to hand to me.  If not, they are sent out to get one.  This is so the main office has a record of their tardiness--otherwise I have to keep changing the attendance on the computer, which I do not have time for.  Then, we briefly check bell work, and then the lesson starts.  I sometimes lecture briefly, assign a group or pair activity, or we discuss the reading students had to do, or check homework--and at the end of the period I assign homework if necessary.  Then, the bell rings and students leave.  I go out into the hall and watch students pass from one class to the next to be sure that everyone is safe.  The next class students arrive and enter the room.  The bell rings, and I do everything all over again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planning and grading are time consuming, and I work continuously all day, and then I work more in the evening after work to finish grading or plan for the next day.  I also work all weekend on grading and planning typically.  This is a never-ending job, and I always have to take work home with me.  There is little time to spend on other things, such as spending time with my family.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be a successful teacher, you must love doing the job, and you must be willing to give everything to it.  </span></div></div>",

On one hand, you can't call yourself a high school student anymore since you've already graduated; on the other hand, you can't call yourself a college student since you've never attended. But there are huge advantages to a gap year if it is spent wisely, particularly in my case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy story is rather uncommon. Due to skipping a grade in elementary school, I finished high school at the age of 16. I also landed an acceptance at UC Berkeley. But due to various reasons, including some that were health-related, my parents decided against sending me off to college at such a young age and instead allowed me to take a year off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy year so far has been great - it's consisted of international travel, lots of writing, and re-applying to colleges. In August, my father and I went on the longest trip of our lives so far as we traveled around the Mediterranean on a cruise and visited Switzerland and Austria. In September, I accompanied him to North Korea, as we were invited by one of his friends. This particular friend owned a company that was in a joint venture with a North Korean company, and we had been invited for the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the joint venture. Normally trips into North Korea can only be possible for business or diplomatic reasons, although the government is also starting to sponsor limited tours. Nevertheless, the country remains one of the least visited, yet most intriguing, places on earth. The most memorable part of our trip was when we visited the 38th Parallel between both Koreas. It was incredible to see that soldiers from two countries, which had shared the same geographic peninsula, language, culture, and blood ties for thousands of years, were now facing each other in nothing but hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only been the beginning, but I can tell that this year will have many more memorable adventures to come. Quite honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better year, and I don't regret my decision at all.</span></div></div>",

But seriously, people would waste every second of my time If I allowed them too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I am bored of the office, I can always go up front and practice my sales techniques, and figure out new ways to stream-line the customers experience and the selling process. Or maybe I will just make some jokes and entertain people for a minute. This is what I call procrastinating. For me procrastination is necessary, as my energy and work pace or not constant, but sporadic. So I procrastinate in beneficial ways such as brainstorming with other people, or by challenging myself to analyze something familiar from a different perspective. I always strive for new, fresh perspectives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also design all of the products my company sells, each one is an extension of me. However, I no longer have to work in the manufacturing side of the products, just simply the design and creation. At times I will go to the lab, suit up, and spend days trying to design new products.  This is very demanding work and most individuals are not mentally disciplined or intelligent enough to do this kind of work.  It is very tedious, and some products have over 100s of prototypes. Usually I experience a burnout after completing a project. I am a perfectionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I do as I want and it may sound like a lot of fun, I am the lubrication that oils the machine. I am the one responsible for everything. If something is messed up, either the employee did not receive the proper training, or I have the wrong person working for my company. Either way, I have to fix it. There are no shortcuts if you want to be a successful entrepreneur. I always have to walk the hard path when it is necessary, no one else will do it for me. This is the roll I have chosen. This is the life I live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm the kind of person that just can't stick to one certain thing for too long of a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, I've been drawing for as long as I can remember. My dad was an artist before I was born, and that skill passed toward me, I suppose. In knowing this, I draw tattoos for people, and used to be an artist for virtual pet sites. It was just money on the side until I got a real job, but it paid pretty good at the time. Because of this skill, I went to a career center and took Graphic Arts as my main class to work in. Then once I finished with that, I went to the School of Advertising Art. I only took one year of college, because it turned out not to be my thing. Too much of a hassle trying to be the best of the best out of so many students going to the school. Besides, deadlines are a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I went to the career center, I met up with someone who became my best friend. Now, before this I'd just write things on and off. It wasn't really something big to me, though I've always liked English to a certain degree. But Rachel wrote stories, and I got to read them. I was so excited to read hers all the time (I threatened her pencil if she stopped writing for just a single second), I decided to write my own book. It got around ten chapters to it before I stopped writing. Now days, I'm still writing. I'm working on a new novel. Going over the one I started years ago...it's crap. I may end up rewriting, I may not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, my mom got me to look for a job, so the first time I became hired was at SuperPetz. And I still work there, yes. It's an interesting job. No dogs to deal with, and the cats come in from the Humane Society. But you get to interact with some of the animals. Some of the customers can get annoying (<i>so</i> not a people-person). The staff are hilarious, and even though the job can get boring at the slow parts of the day, it's still a fun one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that job wasn't giving me any insurance, and my mom told me to find another. Here's my second job that I have: Dayton Daily News packaging department. I put the ads into a machine which bundles up newspapers to be shipped out later at their given date. This has to be the most simple job ever, and I really like it, even though some of the ads can be heavy and everything. The only downside is you've got people who act like it's elementary school with their whining. There's no approximate time when you'll get out, but you're supposed to be out by 7pm. Usually between 5pm-7pm, though, depending on production. But I love, love, love some of the friends I've met in here. They're a bunch of terds. And I get an inside look at what's coming out on sale before anyone else <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/pthb.png\" alt=\"*Pthb*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Pthb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to even earlier, I used to play the piano and guitar. The guitar was harder, but the piano was simple for me, because I've got those long artistic fingers, everyone says. Took both of them maybe for two years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in a nutshell: I'm an artist, work in retail, newspaper factory, a writer, guitarist, and pianist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not all at once.</span></div></div>",

This is just to spin off my thoughts into a different nature. But yes, writing. At 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, who cares if I'm young? If you can write, then write your damn ass off! Be proud, and show off your talent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, my usual day nowadays is a little like this...<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe first thing I usually see in the morning is the mirror-like person across the room. My twin sister, in fact. Yes, we share a room. Because we're twins. Identical. Seriously, I'm sure to God she wants to be a boy, because that girl goes into my cupboard and wears my damn clothes! And no, I do not go to her cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat'd be just wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's a rare occasion she wanders over to my half of the room for clothes. Most of the time it's for one of two reasons: A) To annoy me. B) To talk on the phone. You see, the phone in our room is on my side. So, she goes over my half, whereas I go to hers to use the computer, since she has that instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should go and see if I can switch them around. It'd be a hellova load easier, seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I wake up, have a shower and get dressed, it's delivery time! Around half an hour I spend doing the morning shift of papers. On the skateboard, it gets done pretty damn quickly, so....yeah. That's from 1 AM to 9 (ish) AM SLEEPING, then 9:30 AM to 10:00 AM the paper shift. I get \u00a35 for each shift, so that's not half bad considering that most employers would do \u00a34.30 an hour. And I'm getting 70p more for half the work. Hell yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come home then, and would usually spend an hour editing videos for my sister, since she does music videos. After that, head out with my friends, and usually land ourselves into some form of trouble. Always a laugh, yes.....but when you got cops down your neck.....not good. At all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running back home, it's time for food with the family. Chattering away, making up lies saying that I was certainly not messing about in the shopping centre and epically failing on picking up hot girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help it! Dude, if the girl has got a rocking pair of boobs, would you not say hello?! If you're a girl, fair enough. But dudes...you gotta agree with me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK....where are we.....2:00 PM. Ahh, yes. For about two hours, you do not hear a word from me, unless it consists of the words 'YOU', 'BITCH!' This is me, playing Motorstorm Online, and crashing. Badly. This crude language is usually responded by the words 'YOU', 'BASTARD!', from my sister, who is in the same room as me, playing the same game....at the same time.....in the same race. Yes, we play at the same time. And we have a win ratio of around.....10:8, with me kicking her ass back to her half of the room, whilst I laugh in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing online, we throw on some music as I settle down and do some writing, finally. Here, I'm at it for like....three hours at a time. My sister doesn't care, coz she's got the PS3 to herself, and she'd usually play COD online, and would most of the time kick some idiot's ass easily. She is a brilliant gamer....only she can't drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's around 6:00 PM by this point, and my head has fried. Downstairs we go for food, and then I kick back and watch some TV with the twin and the dad. I'll likely let my brain go numb with the DS and the iPod, and when I'm truly out of it, I head up for bed. This is around 11:00 PM, to be honest. I'll go on my personal laptop then, and talk with mates online. I only use the bigger computer if I'm writing, because I bought an updated Office set and a PDF for it, or if I was editing videos, because the twin bought Sony Pro 9. The laptop was my personal thing for me to write stuff like this, or the stuff i'll write for Writing.com.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time i've finished talking, it's well past midnight. People have gone to bed, and only me and my twin are still up. We power down the computers, and talk to each other until we get bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the cycle repeats itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWake. Papers. Edit. And stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood night, because I need bed. NOW!</span></div></div>",

For example, in the meat department there is way too much work to get done in your allotted shift. Also, all the guys back there are rude, inconsiderate jerks that only care about getting the load up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProduce is wonderful though. Everyone in produce is around 19-22 with the exception of the bosses who are around 27-30. Every one of the people is unique and interesting and funny. Every day I walk into the store, I look forward to whoever I work with, no matter which combination of people it is; they're all wonderful people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but they all work hard and there isn't a WHOLE lot to do. As long as we keep everything relatively full, we'll find a lot of down time where we can goof off in the backroom.

On the bright side they have pretty good insurance but are in the process of raising deductibles as well as prices if I understand them right.  I need the insurance particularly since I have a sick boy at home who has been and will be in need of many surgeries yet to come.  So the shop is good at letting my have the time off when I need it and helped to raise a bit of money to help me in my time of need.  So in a sense, I am part of the family even though I will never make enough to do better than make ends meet so long as I work there.  So do I go to college?

Also, I have to double myself to cope-up with anything with my own time.  I don't own my time...people do, not me.  At one point in time, I have to study hard for my exams to be excellent, that's they said.  Again, I have to work double-time to compensate my time to pay for another time, that I am with.  I knew it's very hard, but I tackled it all with flying colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy morning job entails of the research papers for our clients; be it in bookshelves or internet.  Internet research got me when I knew that I have an interest in browsing the net for all the information that it gives. So, I have to finish 5 researches at a day and my time consumed it until I am ready to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, I have to focus my mind to what the subject matter will be, for I am not quite sure what's the learning system of each teacher.  I've learned that i have to study with my own accord to cope-up with my own doing...working and studying.</span></div></div>",

I mean in most cases they don\u2019t need to know my professional details. What difference does it make if I have 4 degrees and am the most prestigious plastic surgeon in the country or if I am the local school janitor \u2013 especially when I just want to get a free Internet account, or maybe a 20 % discount when Internet shopping??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways its not that I want to lie, or mislead anyone, I am actually happy about my job and don\u2019t mind telling the whole world about it. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know how to define it. When you work in a small 5-worker company over the years you learn to specialize in everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be truthful I did a BA in business communications, majoring in public relations. And as soon as I started work experience n the end of my studies, I realized it was all a big con. I hated it. So I waded through as many jobs a I could to find my vocation. I worked as a sailing instructor, English teacher, shop assistant, air steward, secretary, sale coordinator, transport control officer and other diverse fields. They all had something I liked, but most didn\u00b4t really fill my criteria of a good job, so I kept moving on trying to find the adequate thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of searching, I realized that I had many different qualities, and could be considered  \u201cgood\u201d in various fields, but I really didn\u2019t excel in any particular thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when I joined a small design office as officially \u201ca customer liaison officer\u201d I wasn\u00b4t sure how long it would last.  This was the first time I worked in a small company, and I soon realized that you had to do everything yourself in order to get it done.  We have no computer programmers, no marketing team, no CEO, no secretary, not accountant, not even a cleaner!. One day I might be traveling overseas to a trade fair, having lunch with the president of any major client, issuing commercial invoices, visiting factories or even making coffee for my colleagues. I have learned many skills, including how make web pages, program computer security copies, co-ordinate a sales team, prepare market research reports, design and print publicity papers, organize functions, tally accounts books and even eat fried snake with chop sticks! But the most important lesson in these past few years has been learning that I can do things myself. If the job has to be done, then you must find a way of doing it. I always remember my mother telling me \u201cif there is a will, there is a way\u201d , and she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even though I don\u2019t have a perfect job description and I do have good and bad work days like everyone else, I do believe that after searching for such a long time I have found the perfect job for me.  I call it the unlabeled job.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I have worked retail since I was 18 years old...which gives me roughly four years in the irritating business. I have been everything from a lowly cashier to an assistant manager, and I have found that there are few stories funnier or sader than the ones involving customer service. Before you decide that Customer Service is your path, here is a day in the life of a Savon Cashier:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0            Propping my sunglasses on top of my head, I enter through the automatic doors. A cool blast of the air conditioning greets me as I enter. It is too warm for a jacket, so I am left exposed to the customers, my bright blue shirt like a neon sign that says <i>I work here.</i> My purse on my arm, keys in hand, I head towards the photo department to clock in. I pass through the small, swinging wooden door with <i>Associates Only</i> written in bright red across the front, when I hear, \"Can you ring me up here?\" spoken to the back of my head. I turn around to see an older gentleman standing behind me, a grim expressing written across his face. Looking past him, I see the cashier on register one flipping through a magazine waiting for customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             \"She can ring you up on one, Sir,\" I respond, pointing in the direction of the bored cashier no more than ten feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             \"Why can\u2019t YOU ring me up here?\" the man replies. \"Are these things broken?\" he finishes pointing to the two registers in photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             I take a deep breath and plaster a fake smile on my face. \"No, Sir,\" I answer, \"but there is no one in line on one and she would be happy to ring you up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             \"I have been coming here for years and they always ring me up here,\" the man replies grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             I bite my tongue. \"I'm sorry, Sir, but she is the only one open.\" And I walk away. I slide my badge through the machine on the other end of the photo department. Clocked in, the day begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             I head over to the refrigerated drinks on the other side of the store and grab a bottle of store brand water. On my way back, I am approached by a middle aged blonde woman who spent far too much time in the sun, her skin now brown and leathery. \"Do you work here?\" she asks. I refrain from looking down at my name badge with Savon Drugs written in bright red, or the stitching of Savon Drugs written on my shoulder and answer, \"Yes, Ma'am, how may I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             \"Where can I find shampoo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             I look up at the large boards hanging over every aisle until my eyes come across the one that says shampoo. \"9B, Ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             \"Thank you,\" she says and walks away quickly in the wrong direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             I get in line on register one to ring up my water. My co-worker behind the counter looks up at me with relief. \"Oh thank, God,\" she says as she rings me up. I pay the 35 cents for the water and she signs off like the register is on fire and she must evacuate it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0             I sign on, and commence staring into space waiting for a customer to come through my line. I lean against the cushion that is attached to the wall behind my register. I am hidden behind stacks of outdoor plastic chairs, and a refrigerated coke machine that is currently out of order and is blowing warm air on the normally cool drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An average sized man dressed in a grey business suit and striped blue tie approaches me. \"Are you open?\" he asks. I refrain from sarcastically replying no since there is no other reason why I would be staring off into space behind this counter and answer, \"Yes, Sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Hello,\" I add as an opening to the transaction. He is buying a twelve pack of beer and a bag of original Lays Ruffle chips. I ring up the beer and my register reminds me to ask the customer for his preferred card. \"Do you have an Albertson/ Savon card?\" I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Would you like one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I continue to ring up his purchases, when he says with a hint of defense in his voice, \"That was supposed to be $12.99.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"With your Albertson/ Savon\u2019s card,\" I respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"You mean you have to have the card to get the sales price?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Yes, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Then I don\u2019t want any of it,\" he barks back at me and storms off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Thank you and have a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I excuse myself from the line that has developed so I can get a manager\u2019s key to void out the purchase. Next are three kids, all about 8-10 years old and buying a pair of swimming goggles, a small raft, and something extra that differs from each child. The first child has long stringy blond hair and freckles across her nose. I ring up the swimming goggles, small raft, and a pack of lip glosses. \"Your total is $8.03.\" The girl puts a folded and severely crumpled bill on the counter and looks at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After unfolding the mashed up bill, I say, \"This is only a five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"That isn\u2019t enough?\" she answers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I shake my head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"But that\u2019s all I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Then you will have to put something back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The girl\u2019s face contorts as she decides to put back the pack of lip glosses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I void out the lip glosses. \"$4.84,\" I say and type five dollars into my register. The change jingles loudly out of the machine on the counter and waits for the customer\u2019s retrieval. The girl makes no motion to pick up the change, but instead waits for me to reach across the counter to hand her the change and receipt. \"Thank you and have a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I go through the same process with the next girl that has dark brown hair and hazel eyes, only she wants to purchase a rubber ball instead of a pack of lip glosses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Your total is $6.54.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Oh,\" she answers, handing me a five. \"I'll put back the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I void out the ball. \"$4.84,\" I say and type in five dollars. The change once again jingles out and the girl waits for me to hand it to her. \"Thank you and have a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Only after ringing up the second child, does the first blond haired child say something to the last of the three. \"You might need to put something back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The last child, a little boy, hands me the goggles, raft, and a bottle of men\u2019s body spray. \"Ummm....I'll put back the body spray,\" he says to me as I ring up his purchases and hands me a five as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Your total is $4.84,\" I say and type in five dollars into the register. The change jingles out, and I don\u2019t wait for the child to not pick up the change. I hand the coins and receipt to the boy. The three children walk out of the store into the hot summer\u2019s day, as I say to their backs, \"Thank you and have a good day.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Next is a heavy set woman severely perspiring due to the hot day. \"Hello,\" I say cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Why do you guys keep it so warm in here?\" she responds to my greeting. \"You should turn up the air conditioning or something.\" She places the basket on my counter with her items inside, not bothering to take them out for me to scan. While I am trying to quickly get an item out of the basket to scan, she swipes her card through the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Wait,\" I say quickly and scan an item. \"Now slide it. It doesn\u2019t work until I scan at least one item first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The woman slides her card again. I scan an item that requires her preferred card. \"Do you have an Albertson/ Savon\u2019s card?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Yes, I do, but I don\u2019t have it with me,\" the woman responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I type in 56 enter so she can type in her phone number. \"Enter your phone number here,\" I tell her pointing to the debit machine in front of her. \"Start with the area code, then the number, then hit the green button twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She types in her number and mashes the green button. The number fails to come through on my side. I turn the debit machine around to see that the woman failed to enter her area code first. \"Ma'am, you have to type in the area code first.\" I hit clear and allow the woman to enter her phone number again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This time the number comes across my screen but I notice the area code is 180. \"Ma'am, don\u2019t type one first, just type your number with the area code, and hit the green button twice.\" I clear the machine again and allow her for the third time to type in her phone number. She types in her number correctly then mashes the green button. \"Please hit the green button again,\" I remind her. The number goes through. She saved 80 cents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Was that debit or credit?\" I ask her. The woman hits the button again on the debit machine. \"No, Ma'am, I have to hit on my register, too. Was that debit or credit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The woman answers under her breath and I assume she said debit. \"Would you like cash back?\" The woman shakes her head no. I hit the debit key twice on my machine and the receipt prints out. I hand it to the woman, and she leaves while I tell her, \"Thank you and have a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An elderly lady is next to be rung up. \"It's cold in here,\" she says with resentment, \"Why do you have to keep it so cold in here?\" She has ten cans of canned pink salmon, a tube of Revlon lip stick, and two bottles of Natures Valley calcium supplements. \"Those are suppose to be ten for ten dollars,\" she tells me pointing to the cans before I ring them up. They come up a dollar each. Then I ring up the lipstick. \"That\u2019s supposed to be 40% off,\" she tells me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Yes,\" I answer. I point to the screen where there are two stars next to the price of the lipstick. \"The stars mean that the percentage has been taken off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I then take a deep breath as I scan the two vitamin bottles. The old lady erupts, as I was sure she would. \"That was suppose to be <i>buy one get one free</i>. You never have your machines right. You know, you could be sued for false advertisement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I'll go look,\" I tell the woman and walk to the vitamin section. There are signs everywhere about <i>buy one get one free</i>. I get to the calcium supplements, and there is a bright yellow tag stating buy one get one free of our store brand calcium supplements. I grab two of the bottles and walk back to the register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Ma'am, our store brand was <i>buy one get one free</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"You\u2019re lying. You got rid of the sign, I know it. Forget it. Just void them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I void the two bottles off and put them in the basket of returns under my register, next to the pack of beer and chips. \"Your total is $15.17.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Do I get anything off with my card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"No, Ma'am,\" I answer. \"There was nothing on sale with your card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"You know, ever since I got this card I haven't saved one penny with it. Not one god damn penny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I take a deep breath, and she hands me her card. \"Is this debit or credit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"It's a Visa,\" she says to me like I'm from another planet. I swipe her card through the machine that is facing her, and place a pen on the counter. \"Hit the green button please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"What for?\" she says glaring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"To okay the amount, Ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She shoves at the plastic underneath the button hard enough to spin the machine around. I gently hit the green button for her. I place a slip of paper in front of her. \"Please sign here,\" I say pointing to the line. She scribbles on the paper and I hand her the receipt. \"Thank you and have a good day,\" I say to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The day goes on. Some come through my line on their cell phones, not acknowledging me behind the counter, but taking the time to check their receipt before leaving. Others come in on their skate boards and I have to tell them to not skateboard in the store. They ignore me and commence skateboarding out of the store and out into the parking lot with signs that say <i>No Skateboarding.</i> Packs of girls come in screaming and when I ask them to keep it down, they smart off and tell me to keep it down. All the while I bite my tongue, unable to say what I really think in fear of loosing my job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As the evening draws to a close, I hear a man yelling at the girl behind the pharmacy counter over a discrepancy of how much he thought he should be paying verses what his insurance said. The dispute ends with the man throwing the bottle of pills at the girl and storming off. My heart goes out to the girl and then I am placed in the same situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A woman about mid sixties comes up to me, her face a bright red color and I know she is going to start yelling at me. I later learn that this woman had been stealing from our store for months until our assistant manger had finally caught her in the act several weeks ago. She on the other hand had saw the situation differently and felt the need to share this with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I can't believe that asshole still works here!\" she shouts at me. I am stunned as much by her words as by her tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Excuse me?\" I say quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"How can he accuse me, a woman who is a fucking grandmother for Christ sake of stealing? I spend fucking thousands of dollars in this store yearly, and he accuses me of stealing. I was buying gifts for my grandkids and that asshole embarrasses me like that. I will never come to this store again. I can't believe that fucking asshole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I'm sorry, Ma'am,\" I say quietly, fighting back tears. I slide her items across the scanner. My heart is hammering in my chest and my mind is numb as to what to say. I know I shouldn't let her yell at me like this, but I am left helpless. No one comes to my rescue. \"Your total is $18.95.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The woman throws a twenty at me and it falls on the counter.  I pick it up and unfold it, typing twenty dollars into my register. A nickel jingles out of the machine. I grab the change and hand the dollar, nickel and receipt to the woman. My hand is shaking and all I can hear is my own heart beat. The woman grabs her bag and storms out of the store. \"Thank you, and have a good day,\" I say quietly to the back of her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tasks I'm put to can be very random, and no day is ever the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a given day, I may be asked to attend multiple different meetings, most of which have nothing to do with my job. Often times I'll be asked to meetings dealing with fundraisers for the church, youth projects, etc. just because my opinion is wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to spend time selecting music for the services, which can be very time consuming, considering that there's a lot more to it than just selecting random songs. I have to go through each reading, and find songs that deal specifically with them. It's quite a tedious task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being choir director, I have to hold choir practices. Thankfully, I'm only required to have them when we have new music or are learning choral pieces for Christmas, Easter, or another holiday. But I also have to listen to tons of new music to select pieces suitable for my choir, which can take hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, obviously, I play at masses. This is probably the easiest part of the job. I can practice whenever I want to as long as nothing else is going on in the sanctuary, and I have to show up a little before mass, post the song numbers, play my prelude, sit through mass, play my postlude, and i'm out. Nothing very stressful about that. Unless it's a holiday. . .</span></div></div>",

Thank you Rex for your time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri]  <span class=\"cblue\">Describe a typical day...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">Typical Day:  We work Mon-Fri 8-5, and since working here only have worked one Sat (in Feb) from 8-2pm on a special project: picking up all those stake signs on streets.  What I like is you have a lot of independance from close supervision, if you do the work there is minimal oversight.  I also like the fact that I am in the office for a hour or so in the a.m. then on the street til lunch, after lunch back at the office for a while then out again.  We respond to calls from citizens about tall grass, brush piles and trash, also zoning violations ( home occupation violations, illegal setback of structures, large vehicles left on the street etc...all those miniscule muni code violations).  Good communication skills is absolutely necessary.  Most people who have a violation and get emotional about it, I am able to talk to and get them to see the big picture, why we are doing this and they will end up concuring.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">What is the worst/most difficult problem you've encountered and was it solved?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">Most diff. prob: There really are no difficult problems, they all have logical solutions.  Some take more time to deal with and require getting warrants to go onto land from judges, but that stuff isn't really difficult just time consuming.  People skills is the most difficult... not blowing your cork when you might like to.  Sometimes I have had to consciously remind myself not to spout off as much as you might like.  I was a cop for 30 yrs so have lots of training in that.  People will call us directly to complain that we are not acting fast enough, rarely do they make an official complaint and or go to city manager etc...  </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">How much paperwork and phone work is involved?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">Lots of phone work, we have a decent soft ware program and it has minimal paper work. just fill in the blanks etc...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">Do you just deal with residential properties, or does the job stretch into commercial as well?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">All property within the city limits, however zoned.  We deal only with sign violations in our \"extra territorial jurisdiction\" which is land not in the city but sort of consigned to [the city] for probable later inclusion into the city.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">Do you ever have to deal with construction codes, building codes, fire codes, etc., or is that a different position altogether?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">Very infrequently with construction codes (setback violations of decks or accessory buildings are most common) </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">What is the average pay scale/range for a Code Enforcement Officer-Trainee and also an Officer and is it hourly or salary (referring to the [city we work in])?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">I make something over $16 an hr.and that is mid - range in the pay steps.  Was hired last Nov. after 1 1/2 yrs as a code ofcr in [another city] so they did not start me a entry level.  Acutally we have three officers:  Zoning officer, Code enforcement officer, and a senior code enforcement officer (me).  I suppose all three have different pay levels but are probably pretty close to each other. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">Obviously there's some amount of dealing with the public involved...would you say the public is generally cooperative or generally defiant, and how much time is used in speaking/communicating with them?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Rex] <span class=\"cred\">Just an awful lot of phone calls and explaining to complainants and culprits what the process is, how long it takes  and what happens if they don't comply.  We get a high rate of compliance...if they fail to comply like cutting tall grass we have our sub contractor do it and they end up paying the actual cutting cost plus a $120 administrative fee, if they dont pay we lien their property, so as you can expect most people comply...  Hope this helped.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sherri] <span class=\"cblue\">Yes it did, Rex!  Thank you so much for your time!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strange enough, I saw what I was looking for in a clearing. It was a white tombstone and it glowed, just like the stories I had heard. <br>\r\n  A fortune teller had lived in the area in the early 1900's and I was doing a story on him. His tombstone told of the supernatural powers he possessed. I snapped some pictures and wrote down the inscription on his stone. I had interviewed several older people who had known him and they gave me some bone chilling accounts.<br>\r\n  It was sandy around his grave and nothing grew except cactus'. That was strange because cactus do not grow in this area. I had all I needed for my story and I turned to leave. I felt like something was watching me, so I hurried to my car. When I got inside, the battery was dead. This was so ironic, becase an old lady had told me that when visitors returned to their vehicles, the light would be on, or the air conditoner would be turned up. I quickly dismissed this as a coincidence and called for a jumpstart on my cell phone. It was time to write this story and leave the dead alone.</span></div></div>",

I ship out the classroom materials to our clients and I also sort and deliver mail.  As a former teacher, I find it odd that companies pay big money to buy something simple called \"common sense.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see some of our team-leaders (supervisors) not practicing what they preach.  This makes me very upset.  One of our visions and values for the company is to be the greatest in the area of executive assessment and training.  Yet, when I look at some of our clients, like this one major retail store I like to shop at for groceries, I see them in the news not practicing the culture we instill in our training.  This too makes me upset.  So, I have come to the conclusion that the only way to be happy is to be self-employed and that is why I love being an author.  Even though writing is my hobby, it keeps me sane.  Sanity is a good thing!  So, unitil I retire from the work force, I will continue to challenge the managers I work with to be the very best they can.  How?  I give them suggestions often.  Some are used and some are not.

What's 80 degrees to most people?  I bet they'd call it uncomfortably warm.  If it was humid, they might say it was real muggy.

That's a scorcher for sure.  100 degrees is a surprise no one wants on their birthday.  100 degrees and humid and it's over.  Just go to sleep and wait it out.  Luckily it's not humid here.  It's just hot.  If I wake up and it's 80, I bless the day.  If I get out of the gym and get to work at 90, I'm O.K.  If I go to lunch at 100 and get back at 110, I'm just cheering the boredom away.

Vitals are taken every four hours (during a 12 hour work day). Patients are assisted in bathing, ambulating, and ADLs (activities of daily living). I assist patients to get up to chairs for meals. Some patients require special attention: turning every two hours; changing briefs; feeding; etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCNAs also help patients by meeting emotional needs. Hospital stays can be traumatic. CNAs can be \"sympathetic ears\" for their patients and patient family members. I help patients to meet their goals (i.e. leaving the hospital to go home, getting up out of bed, walking all of the way down the hall, etc.). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCNAs assist other medical staff such as nurses, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, dieticians, physicians, and transporters. Because CNAs tend to see a patient more often than other staff, we can provide valuable information regarding a patient. I tend to have the same set of patients for several days (sometimes months). I can immediately notice changes in vitals, awareness, physical ability, eating habits, and emotional states. Hospital staff depend on me to alert them to potential problems with patients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am also trained to perform EKGs, to work as a sitter when required, and to use various equipment. One-on-one sitters are usually warranted when a patient is confused to the point of possibly self-endangerment. Sometimes a patient will be admitted on a Legal Hold (which may be that the patient has suicidal ideations). I am also required to provide assistance during a Code Blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best case scenario has me working with 6-9 patients. Many days I will work with up to 12 patients. I work on a post-operative floor, which means that I am constantly helping prep patients for surgery, receiving post-operative patients, and discharging patients. The job requires me to adjust to constant changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy particular job allows me 3-15 minute breaks and 1-30 minute breaks. In reality I usually get a quick break for breakfast (10 minutes) and a quick lunch break (20-30 minutes). I rarely sit down during the 12-hour shift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy job requires me to lift and move very heavy patients and heavy equipment. I must have fantastic motivational skills (to get those patients up and moving). I also have to be able to work with different personality types. I need to remain calm during stressful events (codes, non-compliant patients, deaths). I have to take on difficult jobs with grace and compassion (comforting family members, cleaning dead bodies, etc.) Attention to detail is important. Little things mean a lot to someone confined to a hospital room/bed: blinds drawn properly; modesty protected; equipment in working order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to be accurate in my charting of vitals and patient assessments. CNAs have to be cognizant of HIPAA. The State Health Department routinely visits the hospital and CNAs must following good practices. I am required by my state to hold an active CNA license and an active BLS certificate (CPR certification).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCNAs are the frontline in patient care. This job is very difficult but also very rewarding. </span></div></div>",

You almost always have to dress professional for my job; occasionally we'll have \"Denim Days\" on Friday, but usually we have to look nice--business-like. It's only a 20 minute drive to my office from my apartment so I usually get there a little early to find a parking spot and get in a few good points with the boss, should she happen to call before I'm technically supposed to be there (it's happened before).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all have ID cards which we have to use to get into the building--otherwise, the security guard gets irriated and we have to sign in while he frowns at us. Once safe in my cubicle I turn on my computer an look over my desk for the day's projects. A \"project\" is what we call a book. Just pick up a textbook and look at it--from cover to cover, that is what I help work on. We can have more than one project going at at once--in fact, a couple of weeks ago, I'm sure I looked at pages for books ranging from kindgergarten to sixth grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy routine can vary from day to day; it depends on what stage a project is on and whether or not it will need a production read. On a good, busy day, I'll have several units (from a book) to look over. It's a very complicated process at times, and though I've been at it nearly a year, I'm still learning things. It sometimes makes me feel stupid, but I remind myself that it's a complex business and not everyone can know everything--even though my boss does seem to at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the beginning of a project, for example, like one I finished up a few weeks ago, we production editors will be called to do \"cold reads\" of parts of the manuscript. A lot of textbooks aren't created new--sometimes they're just released with updated text (such as election data and so forth), photos, and layouts. The project I started on was like that, but we had to do a cold read of the MS so we could see what needed correcting. A cold read is a basic editing runthrough: we check for grammar, punctuation, and anything that looks weird on the page (you wouldn't believe how many little things can go wrong after we send the MS out-of-house to be assembled). If I'm lucky, I get to mark directly on the page with a pen, if not, I'll have to go through scads of post-it notes to get my meaning across. Production eds can also rearrange text to for clarification or suggest additional words and sentences, but that's really a content editor's job. This process will go on for weeks. The MS doesn't just stay at my desk, but it gets passed around for other pairs of eyes to see what they can see--and also, my suggestions need approval by the executive editors of the projects. Sometimes changes can't be made because of deadlines that have to be met, othertimes, the change is so small and there's nothing else on the page, that we ignore it--sending out even one page costs money and there's a high chance that the vender (the people who assemble the pages from the files we send) will screw it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, especially near the end of a poject when deadlines are looming (along with millions of dollars of profit on the line), work will be so busy that I have to stay over my usual 8-4. That really stinks because I don't get paid overtime, but it looks good to the boss, so it's better just to smile and keep working. You see, my job is contract, so I can definately be kicked out as soon as my contract ends--which happened before at a different branch at this same publishing house. So you need to prove that you're a useful, hard-working member of the team if you want to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's definately a harder job than I expected, but I really enjoy it at times. I was an English major so I'm happy to be doing something related to my chosen field. The people are all very nice and most of them fellow book nerds and word lovers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want a job in editing, it's a good idea to network. Ask people where they work and if you know someone in publishing, milk that for all it's worth. I graduated with a girl who works at my publishing house--it's probably due to her recommendation that I got hired in the first place. Also, hone your editing skills. I recommend \"Woe is I\" by Patricia O'Connor and any other grammar book you can get your hands on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheck up on the websites of major publishers too; most of them have job listings posted and places where you can apply online--that's how I got my job.</span></div></div>",

When we have the annual secretary's retreat everyone looks to me saying, \"Gosh, what a wonderful job  you have!\"  I remind them I'm not hiking in the woods, taking in the scenery, or splashing in the huge Olymplic pool.  The phone rings and wakes me up to from my daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Camp such and such, how may I direct your call,\" I said as I looked out the window seeing a bus approaching with happy campers.  Good a trasfer call so I can take care of the campers.  Transfered and out the door I go with my calendar in hand.  Then I realize I haven't got an empty bed in the entire camp.  My heart drops as I look behind the bus and see cars with parents lined up.  I'm thinking, I'm gonna have a heart attack.  Probably some fool answered the phone and said we had plenty of room.  Lately, one disgrunted employee could have done it to make me look like an idiot.  Either way I had to handle the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to the bus and tell the driver he's at the wrong camp.  He replys, \"No, I'm not.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wake up before my alarm goes off, as I always do. My alarm is set for 5;30, but as usual, I am awake at 5 O'CLOCK in the MORNING! This always happens unless I really need to be awake by a certain time, then I can't seem to quit hitting the snooze button. Anyway, awake I grab my phone, my lifeline to everyone's schedules and hope that I haven't forgotten to enter something in it that is imperative to the delight and existence of one my children. For instance, to purchase a yearbook that I mistakenly put on a never ending reminder <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/rolleyes.png\" alt=\"*RollEyes*\" title=\"RollEyes\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> (until the end of May, not April) so now I hope and pray that they have ordered extras. I lay in the quiet calm of my bedroom and hear the turning of my fan as I scroll through the days events and appointments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, someone has practice after school, but it doesn't coincide with the siblings practice. Fortunately, I think at least Football (in the Fall) and Track in the Spring are held right after school on the grounds so I don't have to make fifty-leven trips back and forth to the school and where ever practice is being held. <br>\r\nScrolling through my days tasks and plans, I notice that we have a PTO meeting that has popped up in new events, that have just been created oh, at about midnight, and can I attend at 1:30? Sighing, I respond, yes I can attend. I will just have to rearrange my afternoon schedule to do my homework (as I am attending online classes, for Criminal Justice).<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI seem to be the only person in the house who can look at what the weather is going to be for the day and plan what my 15 and 11 year old should wear. Lord knows they can't be uncomfortable. I catch up on FB and glance over Pinterest, don't want to get too enthralled in a project that I want to do, or a book that I want to read, to add to my pile of want-to-dos. I enjoy a few more minutes of silence before I roust the kids and the family pet, a beagle who thinks she is human and already is whining from my son's room because she hears scrolling on my phone. I then hear the door creak open and she comes running into my room (the dog that is) to be nosy about what I am doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up and take my shower, so the children who think they are entitled to ALL the hot water won't run it out. Besides, the quiet is still floating over the house and I don't want to disturb it yet with the grumpy voices of my children as they glare at each other and blame everything that isn't going right on the other. If, it's not dark out I will do my mile before the children awake, but I usually have to wait until the Mom Taxi returns from dropping them off at school. Again I don't mind that, because when I am done there is quiet in my home, (until my mom or grandmother calls to rearrange my day).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy son, gets up on his own, takes the dog out, showers and then heads to the kitchen to start the morning coffee, and sometimes make an egg sandwich. Not always, but most of the time. Granted he has to be told, umpteenmillion times to clean up after himself, he still does a lot for himself and the family. Once all that is done, I hear the sound of a sports channel updating us on the latest trade, catch, disagreement and so forth. During all this time I have told my 11 year old daughter that she needs to get up. This usually goes from around 10 minutes when school starts back, to 15-20 minutes around winter break, to a FULL 30 minutes near the end of the school year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time she has to take her showers at night because she cannot ever seem to be in a hurry for anything! She will take too long in the shower in the mornings and always stand in her room or mine wanting to know where a specific piece of clothing is. Then she begins with, what's the weather gonna be, should I wear tennis shoes, or flip flops, etc... I don't know why she asks because she always ends up wearing what ever she should not wear for the weather...who knows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the teeth are brushed, hair combed, and book bags are ready, it's time to fight over who rides up front! I solved this a while back with marking it on the calendar! Go me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could go on and on, but this is just the start of a day...I come back and do laundry, cleaning, cooking, grocery store shopping, and many other things that I just don't have the space even with 10, 000 characters to get into! I always get the look of \"Oh, you just sit at home and watch TV all day since you don't work outside the home.\" Well, buster let me say, I do plenty during the day, not only at my home, but at my children's school, organizing their sports activities by being team mom, subbing at their school when needed. Helping carry out countless activities to make their environment a better one at school and home. It's not easy being a stay at home mom, and I would bet most of us don't get the credit we deserve. Not to mention when you put your whole day on hold, when a parent or grandparent needs you for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWE ROCK!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will never lead to \"something great happened last night here at the house\".  Usually it will entail cleaning up the mess of an incompetent staff, explaining to a parent why I can't do the impossible for their loved one, filing a report with the state, or contacting the county regarding another person for which we are permanently revoking services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently I am the Associate Director of Respite Services for an agency.  We have 29 community homes that house permanent residents that are Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Physically disabled, or any combination of the above.  The home I run has two permanent residents and two respite beds.  The respite part of it you could liken to a hotel.  They come and go.  From one night to one month, and anywhere in between. This usually depends on an individuals funding and how many nights they are allotted.  Most of the time families will call and schedule times for their loved one to stay so they can have a break.  Other times the county calls with what they deem an emergency situation and do not care who is in that spot and bump them out for their supposed \"emergency\".  Most of the parents are grateful for any time they get.  Others feel the world owes them everything.  Some parents understand their child/family member is not the only one residing at the house during their stay.  Others expect me and my staff to ignore everyone else and take care of only their child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was eighteen and graduating high school, I never thought I would end up here.  I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life.  My cousin had just finished getting a degree in Social Services and was running a group home nearby.  Due to the fact it was a newly opened home, they were completely short staffed.  She asked me to just come up and try it for a weekend.  If I wanted a job that would be great.  If not, no harm done and my crappy job at the grocery store would be waiting for me on Monday.  When I walked into that group home on Friday evening, it changed me.  Sitting there starting at me from the dinner table were six mentally and physically disabled adults.  Some had the \"oh goodie, someone else who will help me\" look, while others had the \"ahhh..fresh meat\" look.  Twenty-seven years later, I am still here.  I am not at the same group home.  I am not even with the same agency.  I have however, run the gambit of positions within an agency.   Everything from a residential worker, vocational worker, Supervisor of a day program classroom, to where I am today. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nI've learned the bad along with the good. I've learned that the system isn't always fair and it isn't always who needs the services the most that gets them, versus the squeaky wheel gets the grease.  In other words, who complains the loudest usually gets the services.  I've learned that most Doctors, Dentists, Nurses, etc. would just prefer to pretend special needs individuals do not exist and will go out of their way to make your life miserable just so you will go to another practice.  What they don't realize is that the individual's insurance dictates where they can go, and not many places take their insurance.  I've learned that those who receive social security benefits are limited to how much money they can have in a savings account, so you will find yourself spending their money on things they don't need just so they won't lose their S.S. income, all at taxpayer expense.  I've also learned I've become bitter because of the system.  I've also been bitten, spit on, beaten up, and sent to the emergency room. I've called the police to have someone committed to the psyche ward because we can't control them and they are trying to chase us with a knife.   I've learned you really DO need to have a heart of gold and really want to help people because the pay is crappy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the flip side, I've seen, and received, unconditional love.  I've been hugged just for helping someone tie their own shoes.  I've been asked about my vacation when no one else cared.  I've felt that I honestly was missed over the weekend.  I've seen the spark in the eye when the body traps them in a wheelchair.  I've felt the joy when someone we were told would never speak, greets me at the door and says \"hi\".  I've shed the tears while sitting next to someone's bed while they struggle to hold onto life.  I've felt the pride when grown adults finally learns to feed themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've also had the moments when all is settled and I am sitting in my office reflecting on these moments and know I am where I am supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, I made the right choice at the time.  You do have to love helping people because you will not become a millionaire working in this field.  You have to be able to give, as well as receive, unconditional love.  If you can do that, you've got it made.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ok, so I've had a fair number of jobs so far and disliked pretty much all of them.  The job I have enjoyed the most is one I pretty much stumbled into.  I live in a rural community and there are several schools in the neighboring towns.  Since we are an hour plus away from the city, it can be hard to find qualified aids to substitute when someone is sick.  So I was encouraged by a friend, who works at one of the schools, to put my name in for a Substitute Educational Assistant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing an Educational Assistant involves working one on one with kids who need extra help in the classroom or floating around the class to help the group in general.   An E.A.'s job is not an assistant to the teacher, our focus is on helping students but sometimes if we are unoccupied we assist the teacher with photocopying, or whatnot, however, we often have our hands full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical, there is a course you must take for this job, it's about a year long, although you can take more classes, in related fields.  Since my area needs more help than they have qualified people, I am able to sub when someone is away.  I can also apply for permanent positions when they come up, these often go to the most qualified person or those with seniority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a substitute, I have additional challenges, the regular aides do not have to deal with.  Each school often has their own way of doing things, but in general they have a book with each aides roles, sometimes they rotate schedules.  I'm given a sheet with classes, or student names, etc, and basic lists of duties.  The aides often take on more work than their position calls for, because in dealing with one student, especially those with severe learning disabilities, their studies are so different from the rest of the class they often don't get as much attention from the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeetings with other aides and teachers are supposed to keep everyone on the same page, but I frequently show up, only to find that this aide doesn't really keep current notes on what their student is studying and the teacher has no idea, because they leave the job to the aide, despite the fact the aides are not teachers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to work with a wide variety of students, from Pre-K to grade 12, some physically or mentally challenged or both (often both).  The range of capabilities also varies a great deal, some are kids with ADD, which generally means they learn differently, but can be very intelligent if given a little extra guidance, to those who are non-verbal, confined to wheelchairs and need assistance going to the bathroom, which we do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur responsibilities include but are not limited to: toileting, physiotherapy, feeding, one on one help with classes, note taking, recess and lunch supervision, detention room supervision, speech therapy, life skills.  The academic part can be challenging in itself, it's been quite a number of years since I've been to school, so I often find myself relearning things I've long forgotten.  Even helping the younger grades means being aware of their limitations and teaching at their level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt can be very challenging but it is also the most rewarding job I've had so far, with the exception of raising my daughter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When people asked me what type of work I did my answer was always \"I'm still deciding.\"  It made me feel foolish.  Browsing the want ads one afternoon I  saw an ad stating that the city I lived in was giving the test for Police Officer. I wasted no time in signing up.  How strange it turned out to be.  I passed the written test, followed by a clean medical examination, the interview with the Chief and his staff and lastly an agility test.  So there I was, a veteran of a long process designed to weed out the unfit.  Tomorrow was my first day on the job and when I was honest with myself I realized, I had no idea what a Police Officer does during a day of work.  No one does.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reported for work on my first day I was told to wait in the lobby, someone would be with me shortly.  One wall of the lobby was all glass that looked out onto the parking lot, with the driveway coming very close to the building.  A typical looking unmarked car pulled up and a detective got out, walked into the lobby.  I noticed the car was riddles with small dark holes.  I asked the Detective if the holes were bullet holes and he said yes, they were. \"Somebody shot the car up last night.\"  He wasn't angry, he wasn't scared, just matter of fact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI learned early on that the job of Police Officer can't be summed up in one sentence or cliche like \"I want to help people\" or \"I want to make a difference.\"  You can do those things even if you're a baker, just join some active civic organizations.  No, this job is different.  Helping people is what you do, sometimes.  Making a difference is something you do, infrequently.  Most of your day is spent trying to keep people from hurting each other, or someone else.  Whether it's ticketing a speeder in the hopes of changing his behavior before he kills someone, or taking in a drunk husband or boyfriend to jail for beating his wife or girlfriend, most days consist of the mundane tasks of keeping a small portion of society civil.  It takes a while but eventually you realize these duties are not mundane.  You begin to believe that maybe someone is alive because of something you did.  Just because you don't know specifically who that is doesn't make it less real.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all hope for the big call that results in Supreme Court rulings, newspaper articles and a ribbon to wear on your shirt pointing out you did something good.  But after 20 years of police service my happiest days were the one's when I was able to help someone who couldn't help themselves.  </span></div></div>",

I was working for a survey company using AutoCad.  What I did there was a little different...I created Land Title Surveys and Point Maps for construction surveyors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Land Title Surveys were pretty non-involved.  Generally they were pretty basic and simple, although there was the ocassional nightmare property with tons of landscaping or a difficult house shape.  The maps usually took 30 - 1 hour to complete, depending upon the property.  Those nightmare jobs could take all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would often get to go out and measure the outside of houses and driveways for surveys.  I enjoyed getting out, despite the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI created Point Maps, which are basically a series of points offset by the Right of Way line.  These points would locate where a waterline would fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would get to go out with the survey crews, which I really enjoyed (except for the heat).  I even got to write in the field books, which was interesting.  LOL! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enjoyed working in the Survey aspect of drafting.  I think I enjoyed it mostly because it was a small company and I got to do a variety of things.  I got to answer phones, help people, work with clients, go outside, make maps, organize...and if I really didn't have anything to do, I could go home.  That part wasn't that great because I didn't get paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually had to leave that job (was there for 9 months) because the work slowed to a point that I was only working 5-8 hours a week.  Obviously that wasn't going to cut it.  That's the dangers of a small company.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere at the City...I get paid to do nothing.  If there's nothing to do, I just wait until there is!  <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/laugh.png\" alt=\"*Laugh*\" title=\"Laugh\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

If I may, a little background on how/why I am now in my dream job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was a music major in high school, but never applied for a scholarship, and had no idea what to do with my life at the ripe age of eighteen.  Two of my friends and I enlisted in the Navy together, and during the basic testing, they discovered I was pretty intelligent.  I ended up going into the Nuclear Power Field.  The training schools there were the hardest I've ever been in.  In Nuclear Power School, it was a bit like high school, but had a college curriculum.  We attended six different classes each day, and had one hour of study hall.  Each class had homework every day, and a test on Friday.  If you got less than 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale), you had to come back for mandatory night study (5-9pm) Monday-Friday the following week, plus 7-11am that Saturday.  Somehow I managed to avoid that purgatory, but never really studied at night (not bragging, just telling you how unmotivated I really was back then).  But I do want to say that the math class was 12 weeks long, and went from basic addition/subtraction, multiplication and division, to Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, and Trigonometry in those 12 weeks.  Plus we didn't have those nice calculators, and used slide rules instead.  Sorry to go into all that, but if it wasn't for that education, I wouldn't be where I am now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I now have a great career, and have been here (at Motorola) for over 11 years.  I am a Senior Training Specialist there, and teach about 35-40 different classes to RF technicians on the various radio products and equipment that support their radio systems. The classes range from 'simple' handheld/vehicle mounted radios, to base radios, routers, switches (TCP/IP Networking), programming and configuration of devices.  It is far more complex than I ever imagined it being, but I love this job.  I get to travel some (right now, frequently) as a result.  I've been to Australia, Kuwait, and all over the United States and Canada in delivering classes.  It's an ideal job for me.  Like Confucious said, \"Give a man a job he loves, and he'll never work another day in his life\".</span></div></div>",

Most of the time the people didn't know you were talking to them and they ignored you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked mostly during the day, since I was not in school at that time.  I checked in videos and returned them to the shelves.  I also printed out a list of everyone who was 3 days or more overdue with their rentals.  Sometimes the people just forget to turn the stuff in, or thought they already had.  Sometimes, especially with games, the kid had told them it was in and it wasn't.  It was not unusual to have to deal with an irate customer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, I rather enjoyed it.  I liked the challenge of talking to someone who was upset, and remaining calm and helpful...in the end they were no longer angry.  In fact, many of the customers got the where they refused to talk to the store manager because he was a \"jerk\" and would only talk to me.  I just tried to respect people and give them the benefit of the doubt.  It was not unusual for me to comb the store during those slow hours for a missing game or video.  Most of the time, it wasn't there, but occassionally, it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad part of the job was that there's no 'sitting down' time.  I rarely ever got a break and only once got a lunch.  I once worked a 10 hour shift with only 1 bathroom break (and that was because it was an emergency)!  It was a Saturday, and of course we were swamped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bad aspect was drunk people.  They usually came in right before closing, took forever to pick something, and were just generally annoying.  One lady even brought her drink inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne time this guy came in and asked if his son could use the bathroom.  We were <i>extremely</i> busy...4 cashiers and really long lines.  We can't leave our registers (especially with a line).  There's only one key to the bathroom.  And, the restrooms aren't public.  I kindly explained to the man that we didn't have public restrooms, but that Eckerds or HEB next door did.  He got irate.  I mean, he really lost it.  He started screaming and acting crazy.  You could tell his wife and child were embarrassed.  He stood there and ranting and raved for at least 10 minutes.  His poor kid could have gone 3 times to the neighboring stores to pee!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weirdo eventually left, but it was a stressful moment!  The customers were all really nice after that.  I guess they felt sorry for me having to put up with that.  <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/laugh.png\" alt=\"*Laugh*\" title=\"Laugh\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I tell people I work in State Government, they usually get very impressed. I tell them not to be. I'm basically nothing but a glorified customer service representative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was an English major in college, and hoped (still hope) to work in publishing some day, but I had not found a job by the time graduation rolled around, so I found myself appealing to my best friend's older brother who worked in State Government. Surprisingly enough, I was hired. (Tip for job searchers: Government usually has a lot of entry-level jobs with little skill required. Search on your State's official webpage for job listings)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy day starts with an hour drive to the \"big city\" where I park in a garage for $73/month and then I walk a block to my office building. Since it's government, I got an ID card the first week I started and you have to show it to the trooper when you walk in. If you forget it, like I've done a couple of times, they have to search your bag and make sure you're not carrying anything illegal (aka a weapon) into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spend my day in front of a computer in a cubicle. We are the State Government \"help desk\". Citizens from all over the state call about problems ranging from medicaid assistance, to complaints about what the government is doing (or not doing), and more bizarre tales that you would never believe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly 90% of the people that call ask to speak to the Governor personally. It's strange to me that people actually believe that can happen. It's like they think he has nothing better to do and so I paitently explain (many times depending on the caller) that the Governor is busy, but I would be more than willing to help them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother astonishing thing to me is how few people realize that the Federal Government and the State Government are two different things. I was an English major and stayed as far away from politics as possible, but even <b>I</b> knew that Federal Government and State Government were two different things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's the people that think you can force judges to rule in their favor. That's frustrating because I have to run through what they should have learned in middle school: the US government consists of three separate branches, etc etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have \"usuals\"; people that call in consistently with the same complaint. Some of them don't have a good touch with reality, but others simply don't like the answer they were given. Occasionly I've had to hang up on people for cussing me out and very few times I've had to toggle a \"risk\" button because the person on the other line made threats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's very stressful at times and a couple of months ago when a minor flub hit the media, we had nonstop complaints screamed at us for hours on end. It got so bad that I had to turn off my helpline and breathe deep for a couple of minutes, trying to stop shaking and prevent myself from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's even the people that I hate talking to the worst, though, the ones who truly need help and, legally, there's nothing I can do. Those people break my heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are good parts to my job, however. The people I work with are really nice and understanding. I expected a lot of tense politics and ladder climbing, but its not like that at all. The people I work with truly want what is best for the State and its people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGovernment jobs also offer good pay and good benefits. Health insurance is automatic; dental and vision come after a year. You also get vacation time, sick time, and can work up \"comp\" time if you need to take a day off or leave early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also have a lot of free time. When I'm not getting calls, or working on ceremonial documents (i.e. \"Whereas, so and so\"), I write. And though you might get kicked out when election time rolls around, it will look good on your resume.</span></div></div>",

He works in a smaller city, that also covers several surrounding small towns.  They have 3 different Fire/EMS stations, in which they rotate to every shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe works 24 hour shifts, then gets 48 hours off...unless in the event of overtime.  Then it's 48 hours on and 24 off!  (I'm not fond of the overtime shifts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA typical day for him involves normal things like station duties, which are chores they have to do like clean the bathrooms, sweep the floors, wash the ambulances (inside and out).  They also have to check the drugs and supplies and replenish any that are low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could receive an emergency call at any time.  When they do, they have to drop whatever they are doing (even if they just ordered lunch)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rush in the ambulance, Code 3 (lights and sirens) to the scene.  Sometimes it's a car wreck, sometimes a drug overdose, seizure, heart attack victim...sometimes it's an elderly person who just wants a to talk, or wants a ride to the hospital.  Sometimes it's just a person with atheletes foot or someone who wants attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the condition is not life threatening or serious in any way at all, the patient will often sign a refusal to go to the hospital.  If the patient is in their right mind and refuses, there's nothing the medics can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes they get to the scene and the patient is deceased.  Then they go through a series of trying to revive to patient.  Sometimes it works...sometimes it doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this profession, it's extremely important to have a clear outlook on death.  Everybody has their time.  You have to deal with death and serious injuries, whether the patient is two months old or 95 years old.  You have to be mentally prepared for tragic situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also have to make very quick decisions.  The patient can often tell you what is wrong, and from their description, you have to decide the best course of action to take.  Sometimes the patient can't talk (is a baby or unconcious), and then that's even more challenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe prepared to learn a lot of medical terminology and drugs!  Good math skills are important, because you have to calculate the drug doses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be a Paramedic, you first have to go to school to be an EMT (Emergency Medical Technician).  They help out with basic things like splinting broken bones and asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next level is an EMT-I (EMT - Intermediate).  They are able to do everything the EMT does, but they can also start IVs.  They cannot administer drugs, unless the Paramedic perpares it for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final level is Paramedic.  They do everything, including supervising/directing the EMT's and Intermediates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard work to become a Paramedic, but the job is also rewarding because you are helping people.</span></div></div>",

Staring out of the window, I think about the countless phone calls he recieves. Those lives are somewhat in his hands. They call him for help and he dispatches the help to the ones in need. It is really a remarkable experience for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was January 5-the day my life was forever changed. Listening to my husband talk about the different calls that he gets on a daily basis is so surreal. Not in a million years did I ever think I would be the one calling the dispatch for help-and hearing my husbands voice on the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finishing up the laundry in the laundry room when the phone rang. It was late in the morning; maybe eleven o'clock or so. I figured it was my mother-in-law calling to see how things were going. We had only been married for seven months, but it had already seemed like an eternity! Sighing, I put down the loaded basket of clothes and ran to the kitchen to answer the phone. The familiar squeaky voice filled my head almost immeditaely. It was my mother-in-law. I had so much to do and little time to talk. I knew that my husband would be home tonight and I wanted the house cleaned up so I could spend time with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I listened to my mother aimlessly talk about coupouns for the grocery store, can't miss sales at the mall, and the stray cat that she took in I hear the front door shut. Was my husband home already? I hated to cut my dearest mother-in-law off, but if it was my husband then I wanted to hug him. Embrace him. Love him all over again. Hanging up the phone, I headed towards the living room where the front door was housed. I stopped dead in my tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a voice. Not just one voice, but two or three voices. They were voices of men that I had never heard before. How did they get into the house? Rushing back to the phone, I grabbed it off of the hook, nearly dropping it out of my hands. Did they hear my conversation with my mother-in-law? Unsteadily, my hands dialed 9-1-1. There was rustling now as the feet of the men shuffled through the front room. A loud crash and an omnious thud let me know that my new granit coffee table was flipped upside down and in shambles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9-1-1 What's your emergency?\" What? I didn't have to hold? The familiar voice on the other end of that line was my husband. I couldn't believe out of all of the dispatchers there were I just so happend to get my husband! What were the odds?</span></div></div>",

That includes all the necessaries of that, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes some time to learn everyone's needs and personalities, but in time, it gets easier to care for them. You need a lot of patience for this job, as some of the people you care for can be very intolerant of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best reward you can ever have in this job is having a resident ask for you and only you. It is the best feeling, just knowing that they trust you to take care of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath is a natural part of life, and in this job it is as well. You have to have a strong spirit to do this. It is very hard to lose someone that you have cared for. </span></div></div>",

Along with any of the emergency care areas (A+E, Emergency theatres etc), you have to be prepared mentally and physically, to deal with whatever comes through the door, night or day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gained my degree in 2001, and in the last 7 years, I have worked on surgical wards, High Dependency Units (HDUs), research, audit, and ICU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nICU, for me, is the perfect place to be a nurse. We often have patients who stay with us for weeks at a time, and you get to know them as people and support them as they improve (or don't). You can spend individual time with families, and gain close relationships with the whole family unit. These are things that nurses do well, and want to do well, but is often outside the realms of possibility when you're working on a busy ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is also mentally challenging. You have a much wider remit that on the wards: prescribing treatments within guidelines, extended roles with equipment, techniques and drugs, and a constantly challenging environment within which to practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part of all however is the team. The ICU team comprises: doctors, anaesthetists, nurses, physios, clinical support workers, dieticians, pharmacists and surgeons, and we all work together, each with our individual skills and abilities. There are no egos at play: the patient is first and foremost, and we all work towards that end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a difficult job, and sometimes you'll work yourself into exhaustion throwing every possible treatment at a patient only to have them die. Sometimes your patients will be awake and afraid, knowing that they're going to die, and all you can do is be there for them. But sometimes you wave patients out the door who you never thought would make it, and that makes the struggle worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to work in an area where you will never be able to say 'I have learned everything', then healthcare is the place to be. If, as a nurse, you want the chance to blend holistic care with a demanding technical environment, then come to ICU. It's a wonderful place to be a nurse  <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(NB: I work in a UK ICU.

And somehow people still get a little confused.And I get some version of this question all the time, so I thought I would enlighten everyone this afternoon. (I'm studying for a board exam and really need a study break for a few minutes.)A dental hygienist is NOT the person who suctions and hands stuff to the dentist while you get a cavity filled. That's a dental assistant. And a dental hygienist is not a dentist, although our functions are very intertwined. The difference between the two is basically this...we are geared toward disease prevention, dentists are geared toward fixing problems caused by disease. (ie., we remove tartar,  remove plaque, seal teeth, apply preventive agents and educate... they restore cavities, extract teeth, etc) A hygienist is kind of like a registered nurse in the dental field. Our educational process is very simlar to that of the RN and well...they are Registered Nurses (RN), we are Registered Dental Hygienists (RDH).  For anyone interested, the dental hygiene educational process is a minimum of about 3 yrs, but you can go as far as  Master's Degree in Dental Hygiene. Courses include things like anatomy, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology, psychology, histology, embryology, periodontology, community health and many others. A minimum of 585 hours of clinical dental hygiene instruction (ie. clinic where you treat patients) is also a requirement. In the end, to be a dental hygienist you must graduate from a dental hygiene program, pass a National Board exam (an 8 hour written exam), Pass a clinical practical exam, pass a state licensing exam and obtain licensure from the state. It's time consuming, more difficult than it all sounds, and expensive. And I didn't say any of this to discourage anyone.  I am less than 60 days from graduation and I don't regret even a second of  it. In just a few months I will be a Registered Dental Hygienist and I'm pretty proud of that. Hope this little lesson answers some questions and I hope you'll check for updates as I move closer to graduation and a JOB!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And now back to studying for my National Board exam...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I am a Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS), what is also known as a Medical Technologist (MT). Every single time that I tell a family member or friend what my title is people will ask, \"Oh, what is it that you actually do?\" Even my cousin, who is a doctor, has no idea how I spend my working hours. We generally fall under the Pathology department a hospital's organizational scheme and nurses or doctors will just call us \"lab techs\". That is, if they know who we are at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've ever been in to see the doctor or been to the hospital, and you've had to have blood tests run, your sample has probably ended up in the hands of someone like me. You might have a nurse draw your blood, but more often than not you will have a Phlebotomist come by and take it. (That's a completely separate profession, but still falls under the laboratory's jurisdiction.) Once they have your blood they will take it back to the central laboratory. Depending on what type of tests your doctor has ordered it might go to one of several different sub-sections inside the laboratory. An MT/CLS can \"float\" around to all of the different areas in a lab or they can just work in one main area. These areas are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChemistry - Mostly we use green-top tubes. These have a gel separator in the bottom so that when we spin the tubes down the whole blood and other stuff (plasma proteins) are separated from the serum. This is great because we don't have to be careful not invert or mix the tubes and risk having to re-spin the specimen. Mostly we use big, expensive machines to evaluate electrolytes, liver function, basic metabolic panels, hemoglobin A1C, etc. (If you've ever watched ER and the doctor calls out 'LYTES', that patient's specimen will end up in the Chemistry part of the lab.) We also use red and purple-top tubes to do serum pregnancy tests, HIV screening, and to test serum for titers to things like Hepatitis C, etc. Toxicology is also a part of Chemistry, where we get to test people's urine for drugs. That's always fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHematology - This is where your CBC's and Coagulation tests are run. Again, most of these are done on machines that can handle a high sample volume. You really have to know what your blood cells look like because as an MT you'll have to do manual differentials, where you count cells and have to know if any of the morphology (physical characteristics) is abnormal. This helps doctors diagnose leukemias and other blood cell cancers. If you find anything weird you take the slide to the Pathologist (who is a real doctor) and they make the final ruling. Coagulation tests tell the doctor if your blood has all the essential clotting factors or if you might have a platelet disorder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicrobiology - This is where most of your urine and stool is sent to be culutred if the doctor thinks you've got a bacterial infection. You will have to know what bacteria looks like when plated on agar (special growth media) and be able to differentiate different types of bacteria based on their appearance and their growth/non-growth in different types of growth media. This is also where a bunch of your kit tests are done for Flu, Viruses, etc. Basically any suspected yeast, fungi, or bacteria are identified in this department. We also process wound cultures, your STD cultures (because they are bacteria), blood cultures, etc. A strong stomach is a must as bacteria doesn't really smell very nice. You will make a lot of stains and become very comfortable with a microscope when working in this department. Most of the definitive bacterial identification is made by a machine that has a lot of different reagents and is really smart. But you have to be able to confirm the machine's identification. Some bigger labs will also have a Virology department under the Microbiology department. But viral cultures take a long time to grow so this is probably a very laid back place to work. I wouldn't know. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Most of your serology test will be done here too, depending on the size of your lab you might have a whole different department. Serology tests your serum to make sure that all of those vaccines you received are still working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood Bank - This is one of the most important areas of the clinical laboratory because you could too easily kill someone if you are not very careful. This is where all of the units of blood are kept and when a patient needs blood, this is where the nurses call to scream at someone. If you know you're going in for surgery, though, you probably have blood work done two weeks ahead of time. That gives us time to do your typing and cross match and get you blood that's compatible. In case you have any rare antibodies we have to send off for special blood and hope that someone in the US has donated blood that matches yours, or we give you a really close match. If you come in and it's an emergency we just give you O neg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are different levels of responsibility, depending on how much education you've had. A CLS/MT must have a Bachelors degree from an accredited program. A Clinical Laboratory Technician/Medical Technician (CLT/MT) can do pretty much everything a CLS/MT does, but they only have to have an Associate degree and they get paid a little less. You can also work in the lab as a Clinical Laboratory Assistant (CLA) and you pretty much just centrifuge specimens, process send-outs and set up cultures for the CLS/CLT to read. You have to pass a Board exam to be certified by one of several certifying agencies. And you also might have to get a license, depending on what state you live in. The government regulates a lot of the who-does-what decisions. Actually, the government regulates a lot of the clinical laboratory's mandates. You can pretty much work any shift you want, especially if you work in a hospital or reference lab because they have to have Techs on hand at all hours in case a STAT specimen comes in. Days, nights, weekends, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpportunities are endless. And because there is a large shortage of qualified Techs right now, and most of the really experienced one are older and looking forward to retirement, the job outlook is great. There will never be a shortage of sick people who need lab tests. Plus, working for a hospital, I get excellent health insurance. The salary is not comparable to, say, a nurse because you don't see actual patients -- you just get exposed to their diseased body fluids. There are several other areas where you can work with additional schooling -- Histotechnology, Cytogenetics, etc. Because there are so many shifts there are a lot of supervisors and levels of management. So advancement is not hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI work at a pretty small lab, compared with some of the labs at bigger hospitals and reference labs like Quest and LabCorp. It's a pretty fun job. You get to hide in the lab all day and usually only interact with doctors or nurses over the phone. If you're shy and quiet like me it's really great to be able to hide behind a phone, but you still must have good communication skills. If one of your tests comes out with a critical result you'll have to call the floor and inform a nurse or doctor. About half of my job is dealing with paperwork and quality control, maintenance, etc. so that when the inspectors come (usually from The Joint Commission - I call them God) it looks like we've actually been doing our jobs. Impeccable record-keeping is a high priority because hospitals are accredited by inspection and inspectors just love to look at your records. If your hospital doesn't get re-accredited because you made a mistake then you will so get fired. That could put their Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement in jeopardy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're the type of person who took Biology and Chemistry and liked the lab parts for all of the fun little experiments, this profession might be for you. Keeping patients' tests results confidential is of the utmost importance. Even if they're your family or friends, you can't say a word to anyone-even them-if you happen to see their results. I like to think of myself as one of the unsung heroes of medical diagnostics, but some people might see me as just a button-pusher. Either way, my job is always interesting and the other Techs become something of a second family because you all have to help each other out. Feel free to e-mail me if you want to know more. </span></div></div>",

I just happen to work in the local burn unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking where I do, I have a lot more responsibility than most other techs.  I'm not just the cute little girl that passes out the lunch trays or hands you a cool washcloth.  Nah, you're not that lucky.  I'm the one in the green scrubs who does your dressing change (causing you excruciating pain regardless of your pain meds), changes your linens, suctions you if you've got a trach.  Yes, I do pass out lunch trays and take out the trash, but that's just the low end of my job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA typical day?  I get to work at about 6:45 AM.  I get report from the night tech, check the board to see which patients the doctors want to see that morning and when, and then set up my carts for my dressing changes and roll out any torso dressings.  Once that's done, the nurse and I set about doing our dressing changes.  We cut open the dressings and remove them, wash the burn wounds, then reapply the dressings.  Four days after a skin graft, we take out staples.  Naturally, this is painful--burn injuries are one of few health care fields in which you hurt the patient to heal them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing changes usually take all morning, sometimes longer if a patient is getting into the bathtub.  After that, we get a breather for lunch, and resume the usual tasks of medicating, cleaning, and generally taking care of our patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur unit is small, only nine beds.  But wow! Nine beds take a lot of effort when it's the burn unit.  On days we get an admission, things get more than a little hectic.  After we get the call, the patient will sometimes go to the ER for evaluation.  If it's a bad burn, they come straight upstairs to us.  Then begins the process of debriding (getting the dead tissue off) and cleaning the wounds.  Fortunately for them, most of them are intubated and sedated by this time and don't feel it and won't remember it later.  Their body temperature is critical and we do everything we can to warm them up, since after burn injuries the body temperature plummets.  I've had patients so cold when they came in (still alive, yes) the temperature wouldn't even register on the thermometer.  If we can get them warm and get fluids into them, most of the time we can save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, on occasion, patients do pass away. It's always very sad for us because we quickly attach to our patients, especially me.  We treat the patient with dignity and respect, even after death, and allow the family whatever they need to say goodbye to their loved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love my job.  It's exciting.  I'm always learning something new, experiencing new things.  Yeah, it's difficult, especially when we get pediatric patients.  But I get to do so much good in my job and affect so many lives positively that the good far outweighs the bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was my breather.  Back to work.</span></div></div>",

Because Mr. King would rather pay seven dollars and forty-six cents for his suspenders in lieu of traveling to the only place on Earth that still sells them, a Goodwill in Lawrenceville, Kansas, to get a new pair.  Check MySpace again because you can never be to careful.  Leave a ransom keeping in mind that ransom notes that are written in crayon are usually ineffective, and return to your boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Next, after lunch you go to your treadmill repair appointments.

Those who choose to pursue a college education, prepare for the exams to get into university and end up some four, five or six years later graduating, ready to work in the wonderful world of the chosen profession. Or not.  Unemployment is a tough opponent. <br>\r\n    When I was in the tender and, as I said, mature age of sixteen, I chose to be a doctor. We would very often hear about MSF (medecins sans frontiers- french for doctors without borders ) and learn about the courage, selflessness and love these people spread in areas of the world that were getting tested by wars, famine and other difficult situations. These people were my heroes. I never questioned their dedication, their putting others above themselves and the great mind and soul strength that they had. They were the live examples of giving, caring and loving. They would care for sick children, starved people, people that were getting hunted and uprooted from their countries. So, I decided this was what I wanted to do. Become a doctor and join the MSF and travel around the world to save people. <br>\r\n     I became a doctor, but I didn't join MSF. I had gotten married and had children. It is hard to leave your family and go around the world when you have kids. Or maybe it is fear or cowardice. Or both, I still don't know. And I still think of these people in MSF with awe. <br>\r\n    What eased me for feeling useless for not joining MSF, was one of my favorite TV series, ER. For those of you who don't know it, I have to say it is the most accurate medical drama I have ever seen, and I have watched a lot of them, believe me! I was watching it while I was studying and it made me realize that there are many sick people who need help and who are living next to us. It makes a lot of difference in their lives when somebody helps them, and it is worth making their lives better. <br>\r\n     A human's life is worth saving, whether in a foreign, faraway country or in the next house. Those of us who can,  go away. Those who can't, still do a great job next door.</span></span></span></div></div>",

That's how I spend every day, and I've had a few things published. Right now, I'm working on my third novel. I didn't try to publish the first two; they aren't good enough. I may return to them at some point, though. The novel I'm working on at the moment, though, feels different. It's the story I've wanted to tell for so many years, so I've avoided it until now. I think that's because of the fear of failure and  not being able to do the story justice. I think I'm ready to do that now. And so, I am a writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always have been. I wrote a lot of stories as a child. I didn't have any brothers or sisters, so I had a lot of time on my own to write. I never believed my stories to be any good, though. So I didn't pursue it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, I went to university to read Literary Studies, and so I have a BA (Hons) in that subject. Only, I did nothing with it until now. After graduating, I worked in a tiny, backstreet insurance office. I sold insurance, I wrote the policies, processed claims, took care of every day changes. I was promoted to office manager within nine months, which was no extra money and a shed load more responsibility. My boss was an asshole. Even so, I worked there for thirteen years, when I gave up working to care for my Mum, who was completely bed-bound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my \"job\" transformed into a full time carer. I had always looked after my mum because she had Rheumatoid Arthritis, since she was 26. It got progressively worse over the years. But that's for a whole other chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy self proclaimed title of Writer is definitely the best job I've had. It's the one I sent my life working toward. It's the one I was born to do. I truly believe that. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't write any more. I guess I'm lucky right now, to be spending my time doing the thing that pumps my heart.</span></div></div>",

All honey-blonde highlights and bright eyes, she breezed into the shop with a smile on her face and her husband in tow, and when we called out a greeting, she responded cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the other girls on shift were already helping other customers, so when Sunny plucked a pair of pants off the rack and started eyeing the size on the tag, I detached myself from the counter on which I'd been leaning and went over to help her find her size. She asked me what I'd recommend pairing with the pants she liked, so I picked out a few different tops and started a dressing room for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved the outfits I put together for her, and what at first seemed like a simple mission for a single pair of pants soon became a full-blown shopping extravaganza. After she confessed to me that though she loves fashion and funky looks, she tends to dress rather conservatively because she doesn't really know how to put the looks together, I started bringing her a few other outfits that I thought would look cute on her. She loved almost everything I showed her, and so did her husband. While she tried things on and he waited, I brought him a bottle of water. Sunny loved our current collection, and also wanted to see some pants from our new collection, which we'd just gotten in and hadn't even put out in the shop yet. I showed her a couple of pairs of gorgeous pants, and she fell in love with them and took them in both colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we'd bagged up her twenty items and run her credit card through, Sunny told me how much fun she'd had. She'd been really fun for me to help, too--so pleasant, sweet, open to new ideas, and funny--so I told her that. We parted on great terms. She made my day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCustomers like that are one in a hundred, but they make all the rest of the job worthwhile. I didn't like her because she bought nearly a thousand dollars worth of clothing, I liked her because she was so charming and fun to help that it was almost like shopping with a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've gotten to the point where I know there's nothing I love as much as writing, nothing I love enough to commit to doing as a career besides writing, and nothing else I'm particularly good at except for writing. Unfortunately for me, it's very hard to sustain oneself by writing, and so now I'm a full-time retail sales associate at a semi-upscale ($30 T shirts, $100 sweaters, $300 suits) womenswear shop. I work with some really great girls, most of them around my age, some of whom have become very good friends, and their company makes my job a lot more enjoyable than it would be otherwise: every day we have moments that are more like freewheeling parties than actual work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there is the actual work. When things are slow, we make sure the clothes are neatly folded or hung, the hangers are all facing the same way and are all appropriate to the clothes they hold, the mannequins are current and clean, and the shop is well-stocked. We also write thank-you notes to all our customers (company policy, and we get a bonus if we do all our thank-you notes). Selling is stressful. The company has a very strict sales performance standard: usually we have to sell, on average, at least $100 per hour over each two-week pay period. We only get commission on whatever we sold above that base $100/hour standard. If we don't make that goal, it's called going in the hole, and it's very bad. No commission, and going in the hole two times a row (meaning, selling badly for an entire month) means getting fired. In addition, if we're in the hole, we have to sell almost ten times that much <i>above</i> our usual goal the next pay period round in order to get out of it and make commission. On any given day, you'll see at least two of us hunched over the schedule sheet, calculator in hand, figuring out how much we need to sell, then going to the computer to look at our numbers in the clerk performance report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe company's dress code is strict. We always have to wear the company's clothes (luckily for us, we get a %50 discount, and the clothes are nice--my wardrobe's improved a lot since I started working at the shop), nice (read: uncomfortable but good-looking) shoes, and always should have neat hair and makeup. A lot of grooming and a lot of aching feet are involved in working there. For most of us, though, it's fun. We just had a new shipment of clothes come in, and it was like Christmas, opening up all the boxes, seeing items we loved, and planning what we want to buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways, working at this shop in the mall is like being in high school again. There are cliques and crushes (almost every girl in the shop has a crush on one of the guys working at a neighboring shop), gossip and juvenile office politics (one of the girls I work with has gotten on everyone else's bad side by poaching others' customers, being too aggressive, and being kind of rude besides)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm at the point where I know that the only thing I really love, the only thing I love doing enough to commit to for the rest of my life, and the only thing I'm any good at is writing. Unfortunately for me, it's difficult to pay bills and keep myself housed and fed on writing alone. Hence the day job. As things go, it could be much worse.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I always wanted to be a writer. I dreamed of somehow just \"becoming\" one. I did not realize that writing was work--hard work! But I get ahead of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to a small high school and there were not many extracurricular activities other than sports. I wished we had a newspaper or a creative writing club. In English class, we did some writing, but it was mostly expository themes. Boring! My teacher frustrated me because she told me I couldn't write, and I was scoring 13/20 on her grading rubric--an F! *sigh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I did not let her negativity destroy my dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did have a chance to write a tiny column about school for the local weekly newspaper, but I didn't have any freedom--the article was always approved by the principal. Nonetheless, it was exciting for me to be published.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to major in journalism when I went to college. An English major had too much reading to do and I was avoiding the classics like the plague at that time. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Journalism seemed to fit what I thought I could do. I wanted to get good grades, and so I decided to do something that would be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI liked the writing part; I hated the interviewing part. I am not a people person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I did not change my major. I plugged along, doing what I needed to do to maintain my A average. I enjoyed my history and anthropology classes a lot more, and probably should have changed my major. I had my parents' constant nagging about finding a job, though, so I stayed in the major I chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked for the college newspaper, but did not like it very much. My other jobs as a library assistant and as a peer tutor were much more satisfying and rewarding--not to mention they were easy and had a lot of free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring my junior year, I had to find a paid internship for that summer as a requirement to graduate with that major. I had worked at a small weekly newspaper during the previous summer, but that wasn't enough time to count, according to the professors, so I was desperate to find something that would count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad had some connections at an industry publication in which he advertised, and he helped me get a paid internship with the magazine. I did have to interview for the position and everything, though. It was not \"handed\" to me, by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat job was mostly creating ads for the magazine. I learned to use Pagemaker and CorelDraw and some paste-up skills. (Back then, in 1993, some magazines were still pasting up their layouts.) I did not write any original articles or anything, but I did typeset already-written material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI loved it. I did not have to deal with people and I had some creativity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when I went back to school in the fall, I took a layout and design class offered by the journalism department, and one that was offered by the business department. I remember that my professors tried to dissuade me from taking the one offered by the business department, but I was not about to miss my opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did well in both, and as my senior year drew to a close, I began looking for a permanent job--in layout and design. Although I was not a graphic arts major, I still had a good background in the practical side of layout. I think that my internship was the most important skill I gained at college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hired at a printing company where I learned QuarkXPress and used Adobe Illustrator to do layout and design. Mostly, I did the layout. Customers submitted their own designs. I made a variety of products: newsletters, magazines, newspapers, books, flyers, business cards, envelopes, and the like. Some materials were still pasted up physically with wax, but the majority of jobs were pasted up electronically on the computer. (This was in 1994.) Deadlines were important to meet and I was constantly under stress, trying to meet them. Sometimes, the customers were picky and I had to re-set things a hundred times to satisfy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked there for about nine months at $7 an hour. At that time, I thought the pay was enormous. It was more than I had ever made before, but it was still barely enough to scrape by. Thankfully, my parents still helped me out by paying for my car insurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as with all jobs, there were people I got along with and people I did not like. I was moved to a different shift, which I did not like, and morale at the company was low. Plus, this company was three hours away from my family and I wanted to move closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found another job at a college book typesetting company, and have been there for almost ten years. I started out at $7.25, but have now more than doubled that pay rate. I don't have to deal with customers, but my job is VERY detail-oriented. I have to follow lots of conflicting instructions and remember lots of different things while producing pages. Although I do not deal directly with customers, my boss is very exacting and perfectionistic--it is his company, after all. I am also a perfectionist, so this quality helps me stay focused and remember the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach book has a set of instructions which lists the design parameters. I have to follow them to the letter and sometimes change things on the fly, when the design is modified at the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo do this job, you need more than just a working knowledge of page layout programs such as Pagemaker or QuarkXPress. In fact, you need many skills, such as listening, following directions, thinking ahead to the next stage of the process, planning, intimate knowledge of design principles (which I learned on the job), how to use a ruler, how to convert measurements, paying attention to detail, and various other things that you really can't learn in a classroom setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of how easy it sounds, I come home from work exhausted at the end of the day. Thinking takes its toll. My hands often ache from typing or using the mouse all day. My neck hurts too, and sometimes my eyes feel strained from staring at a monitor all day long. I sometimes have to work overtime if certain books need to be finished by a certain day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a good job and I am treated well here. I often feel lucky to have found this job that suits me so well--but at the same time, I feel chained to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving this job does free me to pursue my writing dreams. I have plenty of free time after work to follow through. I just wish I wasn't so tired! LOL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you think you might be interested in pursuing a career in page layout and design, I suggest you major in graphic arts. Even if you can't draw, you will get the background you need in design and other things. I feel handicapped sometimes because I did not have those classes. If I did go back to college, I would major in graphic arts. However, if you do major in graphic arts, remember that simple is best. <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></div></div>",

I had already chosen the career path I'd be taking, so after basic I went straight to Meridian, Mississippi to be schooled in the art of the Aviation Storekeeper.  School was school...  Books, studying, testing, etc.  After officially earning my rating badge, I was sent to an aviation command in the beautiful state of Washington.  Attached to an expeditionary squadron, I became one of those lucky sailors who never see a ship.  Since then I've been to the Middle East three times.  Deployments are rather confidential, however, so I'll describe the day in the life of an AK at sunny Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, I should explain something.  For anybody familiar with the AK rating, they probably know it no longer exists.  The Navy clipped my aviation status and made me into a regular SK.  However, my job has not changed.  I'm still in the aviation community and aviation is all I know, so saying that I'm an SK would not be entirely accurate.  AK's and SK's do things different since they work on different platforms.  Anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job of the Aviation Storekeeper within a squadron can be summarized as saying I'm the liaison between the aircraft maintainers and the warehouse.  The maintenance department keeps the jets in prime condition, fixing every gripe.  However, most parts can't be fixed right in the squadron's shop.  They must be sent to the base's main workshop that has capability (all the heavy equipment) to repair them.  Those parts go through me.  Paperwork, paperwork, and... I think I'm forgetting something...  Oh yeah, PAPERWORK!  When the bad part goes to the workshop we receive a good part from the warehouse.  This goes on quite continuously all day long within a hard-working squadron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the jift of the \"technical\" aspect of my job.  This job, however, is known as supply.  That means, \"you ask and you shall receive, even if we have to pull it out of a magician's hat or ask our ever-dependable genie.\"  This is everything from uniform items to office supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInventorying everything under the sun is another favorite of this great occupation.  It keeps the blood flowing through our veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur job doesn't necessarily have a set time schedule.  We go in to maintain the aircraft's capability for flight.  We leave when those planes are flight capable or we've done all we could possibly do in the attempt.  I've worked plenty of long hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know this sounds very interesting and all.  What better way to accelerate your life than to join the United States Navy!  Actually, being in the Navy is wonderful...I hear.  A sailor on a boat gets to see all these great ports and such.  I'm just one of those \"lucky\" few who deploy to the desert.  Oh well.  Real sailors have their sea stories.  I have my war stories.  GO NAVY!</span></div></div>",

Job security was sketchy in the 1990's, it has improved over the last four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPT school is difficult to get into, very demanding and competitive. You have to be skilled in communication, sciences and some math. You can not be squeemish. I had to dissect a human cadaver, and do other unpleasant clinicals in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to be a patient person(get the pun?)willing to work with sick people and their families. I have patients who are celebrities; others from rural areas who can't read or write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not a glamourous job. I have seen every body excretion to ooze out of every crevice you can imagine. We have been bit, kicked, punched, hit, cussed at, spit at and reviled. On the other hand, we are thanked, blessed, appreciated and have made lasting friends with our patients. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a physically demanding job. You have to be in good physical shape to perform the job safely. Some of my patients weigh over 500 pounds! Yet, a tiny 80 pound patient can cause your back more grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould I go into PT again if I had a choice? No, I think if I were to stay in medicine, I would have been a physician. If I have to be in school that long, I may as well be the top of the food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any other questions about medical professions, email me. I am Schipperke.  </span></div></div>",

I know a thing or two from working there. <br>\r\nNever come between a person and food. As a cashier people come directly to me when something is wrong or the food is taking a long time. I don't know why they yell at me. I can't do anything. I just take money,  your order and your drink. That's it. If i could i would go in the back and fix it myslef but then the person in line would get mad at me. I can't win. <br>\r\nPay stinks. Since i only work one day, i don't get paid alot, but that might just be on my part. A guy that used to work at my Chick-fil-a wanted a raise (he worked practically everyday) and when he didn't get it, he quit. Another reason was because i went through two owners and only one increased my pay. My Chick-fil-a also only hires young people so they can pay them less money, but people under fifteen can't climb ladders. You also smell like grease when you leave (fact). <br>\r\nNametags. I hate wearing my name tags because people can't pronounce my name correctly and i don't want them to remember me if they had a bad experience since people tend to blame the first person they see instead of thinking that a cashier can't make a sandwich out of thin air. Now i know sometimes i mess orders up but i'm not perfect and i will immediately try to fix them. I've been there for a while and just to let anyone who reads this, number one thorugh number eight all come with fries and a drink. Number seven and number eight coem with fires and coleslaw. 90% of people get that wrong and want refunds. I just want to let you know so i won't have to refund.<br>\r\nUniforms. My first uniform was tight around the waist (and my waist is small) I couldn't breathe and i would always have apin around my waist. My new uniform was tight around the legs so you could see your hips and behind. I like my new red shirt though. Our incentives are a basket of candy, tvs, radios, gift cards etc. I want money (i'm like that for Christmas also). I don't like being forced to use it if i didn't need it. If you give me money i could use it for gas (something immediate). <br>\r\nI'm not trying to scare you. I just want to let you know the perks and the jerks. You might be lucky and work in the back and see no customers. You might like it, but just one thing...try and let it be your last choice.   </span></div></div>",

I can deal with issues that range from difficulties accessing government services, to assisting people in filling out forms, attending court with people who need that extra body there as a support, to contacting and sitting in meetings with elected officials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdvocacy. Advocate.  Words which don't mean a whole lot to many people, and invoke fear in others.  For the people that fear me, it's usually because they have a vision of an advocate as someone who comes in and gets the job done at all costs, and probably sacrificing a few people along the way.  Not so, I say.  My job involves taking the time to listen to what someone's issues are, exploring a little bit below the surface issues to make sure there are any underlying issues contributing to the problem, and then acting as a mediator or facilitator to resolve the issue.  A good piece of what I do is not even in my job description - it's taking the time to just listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will attend meetings with people who have disabilities.  Often they are having a hard time conveying what it is they need and how it is that what is being offered just doesn't quite meet this need.  The easiest way to explain my role in these situations is to explain that I am a translator - I translate from people-speak to bureaucracy-speak and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can attend meetings that are not individual advocacy issues.  These meetings - committee meetings, are to assist people who provide a service to ensure that the needs and concerns of people with disabilities are being met and that systemic barriers are not being put in place that will hinder the individuals from accessing services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI field a lot of questions from the public and from other agencies about where and how to access services.  I must have a comprehensive knowledge of what is out there in the real world, and I must also be willing to admit when I don't know about a service. This lack of knowledge then sets into motion the \"I got to find it\" mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to sum up, if it is possible to do so - I field phone calls from individuals who need one-to-one help accessing services, resolving issues; meet one on one with these individuals and attend meetings with them; sprovide information to the general public and agencies on different programs and services; attend board and committee meetings; and whatever else may come my way.  I need to be aware of local, provincial and federal laws and the respective services they offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills and abilities that a person needs to have to get into this field?  People will know it if they want to do it.  Many individuals who do what I do have a background in Social Services or Social Work.  Compassion and empathy are a plus, if not a must.  And, last but not least, you need to be flexible and creative, but be able to think in a logical way.  You also must be able to think outside of the box.  True, much of this sounds like a paradox, but it is possible to have all these traits rolled up into one individual.  Most importantly, as a person gets started in this field, these traits and skills are something which is built upon as you explore and develop into the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClear as mud?  I hope not.  Maybe the title of my chapter should actually be:  People Problem-Solver</span></div></div>",

An incision was made in his anterior neck to accommodate a spit fistula, and now my patient sits on the edge of his bed holding a pink basin to his throat to catch the river of blood that flows from it. I watch as if in slow motion as sheer terror replaces the hope that had once been in his eyes, and he silently pleads with me to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, my God</i>! I think, as I turned to run out of the room. <i>I need to go get the nurse</i>! Then it dawns on me...<i>I AM the nurse</i>!

As a registered nurse, my job is to make my patient's day (or night, as the case may be) a little better...make them smile, answer their lights promptly, listen to their concerns, and ease their pain. On those rare occasions when I'm assigned a dying patient, I work with that person's doctor to make their passing as comfortable and pain-free as possible, for the patients as well as the ones they leave behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's more than just a sick body on the bed in front of me; there is a human being, and human beings have many levels of need: emotional, physical, spiritual, psychological, social, etc. Patients look to their nurse to be their therapist, caregiver, friend, priest, and confidant all rolled into one, and we promise you the best care we are capable of providing for the 8 or 12 hours you are entrusted to our care.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The job is so big, and entails so much, that it would take a full size novel to just get through a day... Also, because of the schedule we go through busy days and slow days, so I may write about multiple days in different chapters. Don't worry though. I'll always include a \"Different occupation\" button so you don't have to sit through my ramble if you don't want to. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, after that rather long preface, I present to you The Life of an Athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll tell you about a gameday, because those are always busy. An athlete's life is usually filled with little superstitions and rituals, that the public just can't see. Such is the case with me. I actually saw this story and kept a journal of my days for a few months, so I could give you an accurate feel. My day starts at about seven AM. I wake up and get dressed as fast as possible. After grabbing the closest thing to eat, I head out the door. I head to the rink for an early practice, and arrive there only minutes later. (There are benefits to living close to the rink)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I head in the VIP entrance of the arena. It's a massive building, constructed specifically for my team only four years ago. It seats 10,000 people, and it comes fully equipped with lounges, restaurants, and stuff like that. I love the place, and I spend most of my time there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I'll make the ten minute walk to the complex entertaining by listening to music on my phone. I have different music for each situation, so I'll play different stuff depending on if it's gameday, I'm starting or finishing a game, what time it is, ect. On this particular day, at 7:36 AM, it's Ariana Grande. Laugh all you want, but most hockey players are actually big sweethearts on the inside, and we're compared to big teddy bears by people who know us best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm one of the biggest personalities in my league, meaning that I constantly have to deal with media attention. The cameras are everywhere, filming for various channels, websites, shows, ect. I've learned to ignore them and go about my business, because that's all they want to film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep walking down the bright hallway to the home team's complex. Let me stop for a moment to explain a complex to people who aren't familiar with it. Those of you who know about sport complexes can just proceed to the next paragraph. In each arena, there are two  complexes. One for the home team, and one for the visitors. They are restricted areas for only media, team personnel, league personnel, and VIPs. They contain things such as team gyms, dressing rooms, doctor's rooms, equipment rooms, ect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I complete the ten minute walk to my own complex, which is conveniently located on the exact opposite side of the arena from the VIP entrance. The first thing I do is head into the dressing room. Most of my teammates are already there, preparing for the morning skate. I head to my stall, and begin to change. After putting on my skates, pants, leg armor, and socks, I grab seven packs of gum from the table in the center of the room. I'm not too picky about what brand I get, but it HAS to be mint flavored. It's one of my little superstitions that I can't bear to ignore. I have to take seven before each morning skate, because I've done that every day since I was 14. It's partially a matter of ritual, and partially because I chew a lot of gum. I like to tell people I'm addicted to it, so I don't feel so bad about the crap I'm swallowing. In truth, most hockey players chew tobacco, and gum is the only thing that keep me away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext I'll get a member of the equipment staff to grab me five water bottles. Three filled with water, one with white Gatorade, and one with coconut water. I'll line them all up on the right side of my stall, with the water at the front, then the coconut water, then the Gatorade. This makes me drink the water first, which is what I want. There is actually reasoning behind this ritual, because the water is what I need right then. This is for a couple of reasons. The first of them being that water stimulates blood flow, therefor making you more quick, agile, and receptive. That's just what I need going into a skate shortly after waking up. The second reason is that drinking water is clinically proven to loosen your muscles, and that's also important for me. The third reason is a branch off of the first, but it's that the more blood is flowing through your veins, and the faster it flows, the more ability you have to self generate heat, which is important before going to spend 1-2 hours on the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coconut water is for as soon as I get off the ice. By that time, the water should be gone, and the equipment staff should have replaced it with bottles on the left side of my stall. I'd like to pause the story and recognize the work they do as well, because they're so great. They know my rituals, and accommodate them. They work day and night to make my job easier, and they have a very neat job. I know because I used to be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the coconut water. It's for right after the skate, because it contains the necessary nutrients to refuel your body, such as proteins. It's also enhanced with minerals to spike your on ice performance. And the last of the drinks is the Gatorade. Most people drink it right before a game, but that's the wrong decision to make. In truth, the amount of sodium in Gatorade is far too much for the amount of liquid used in the drink. That means it will do three things to you, and I'll explain them below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing it does is dehydrate you because of the salt. That in itself is a problem, because it makes you tired, sluggish, and in some cases, faint, dizzy, hallucinogenic, prone to convulsions, and nauseous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second of the effects is equally bad. The salt used in Gatorade is cheap, and therefor bad quality. It's artificial salt, meaning that it doesn't break down as easily. Even though it doesn't look, taste, or feel like it's actual grains of salt, everything is made of particles, and this salt is made of substantially larger particles than natural salt, such as sea salt. What that means is that when it gets into your blood flow, it will still be in small crystal form due to the longer dissolving time required. The downside to the crystals being in your blood flow is that is may actually make small slits in your veins as it travels through them, and the slits will take a while to heal.

The sugars in it are converted into the carbohydrate form that you need to enhance your performance, resulting in enhanced abilities.

I buried my head in a book during my last year of secondary school (called high school I think in some places) and got a high enough overall result to pursue my dream.<br>\r\n After that I went to college and studied psychology and English and music in my freshman year. I liked English and music and was sorry to leave them behind. Psychology became a much more vast subject then it was in the first year. So I went through college and then passed the The Psychological Society of Ireland's exam. I was now a fully trained psycholigist! and I was delighted. Soon after, I got lucky enough to receive a position in a clinic. <br>\r\nI chose to be a child psychologist because I believe it to be very rewarding. The job pays well and I'm doing something I love to do! The job has it's ups and downs as you never know the story of your next patient and sometimes you can only feel sadness for the people you threat, but you do everything humanely possible to improve their quality of life. The job is 9-5 with little to none overtime and I love it!</span></div></div>",

Well if you equate excitement to stress while trying to maintain a pride in your work then this job wass full of of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst the job was not just purchasing. I had to record all the Health &amp; Safety records required such as temperatures of incoming goods, invoice numbers and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly I was responsible to ensure that the goods receiving area was clear and clean. Considering that it was the area where all the garbage was placed made it a continuing and less than rewarding task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirdly I had to put away all the food coming in. That meant removing all packaging and placing the items in to containers, label and put them away. That also meant having to clean up the fridges, freezers and stores because the chefs hardly ever did that for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourthly I recorded the price and amount of every item coming in so that the gross profit (GP) of the kitchen could be calculated. If the head chef had been worth his salt, he would have been able to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifthly I costed all the menus that the chef came up with. In the end he did not know the worth of anything coming into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSixthly I had to be the central point for deliveries of al ltypes coming into the hotel. They included chemicals, wine, kegs of beer, stationery. Often people would not tell me that a delivery had arrived and so I could not find out what happened to the paperwork. (Another hated part of my job - the paper chase.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventhly I was part of the Green Team. The people who looked after how we dispose of the waste from the hotel. Recycle, recycle, recycle! Nobody knew how to do it. I constantly had to go through waste sacks and remove items that had been put in the wrong place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like I did not like the job but I did. It was the attitudes and lack of help from those around me that made the work less satisfying. I'm glad I don't work thre anymore and am looking for other openings.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I get up at 0445 a.m. to catch a bus to make it to work by 0700.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that damn parking bus always makes me late\" I grumble to myself as I race to clock in on time. \"Stupid time clock,\" I continued my musings on the elevator up to my floor,\u201d Why did I get a 4 year degree, thousands of hours of continuing ed and certification in my specialty to be treated like factory worker? Nursing is so schizoid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's 0700 and I just make it to clock in and grab my assignment. I look to see its Baby Boy C again. I feel the sigh of resignation come out. Baby C was a little 26 weeker (born 61/2 month early) who weighed about 750 grams (about 1.7lbs). Sometimes 26 weekers do well and have minimal problems. Those are the ones you read about in Reader's Digest or see on Oprah. Some die. And some like Baby Boy C come out sick and stay sick for a long time and become \u201cchronic\". Chronic babies have lungs that are damaged from being on the ventilators. They need the vents to save their lives but in the long run it also damages the lungs. <br>\r\nBaby C also has the chronic personality. He is extremely irritable with any change or sudden touch. For most of his life, 9 times out of 10, touch has meant lab draws, IV starts or vital signs interrupting perfectly good sleep. So it\u2019s hard to blame him, but it also means that it's hard to comfort him. That\u2019s why I sighed. He is a hard baby to like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy other baby is a \"feeder grower\" which means the baby is in an Isolette, on oxygen getting tube feeds just waiting to gain weight. Baby Girl A parents don't speak English only Spanish which makes teaching and updating a challenge for me. And I have first admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get report from the night nurse who has been here since 1900 (7 p.m.) last night. 12-hour shift are normal for my unit and most units in my hospital. Tracy tells me that Baby C had a good night. He is on high flow nasal cannula oxygen and only had 2 \"fits\" last night. Fits being he cries so hard that he turns blue drops oxygen saturation and needs extra oxygen and holding. Anyone not knowing Baby C would think that there is a major problem when he has his fits especially looking at the numbers on his heart monitor. But what he really needs is the extra O2 and a strong hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby A also had a good night and is on the fast track to be transferred to the Level 2 nursery which is a step down from the intensive care unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking charts and checking for meds to give, I begin cleaning. I clean the Isolette, the crib, the monitors, the charts and the chairs in my area. Surprised? Don't be. Alot of hospitals are cleaning the 'bunker\" or patient care area every shift to cut down on infections. Medicare soon will not be paying for certain hospital acquired infections. So this practice is as much for the hospital survival as for the patient. Most of our babies are receiving Medicare.  The average cost of hospital stay for 500-700gramer is $224,000 so it's smart for everyone.  There is only one PCA or patient care assistant in the unit so each nurse cleans her/his work area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot an easy thing to get done while I am working around interns, residents and attending who want to see the charts and the babies before rounds. I have no problem with this except I tell them all if they wake Baby C they will be sorry.<br>\r\n\"My policy is you wake, you take\" I tell the intern. \"Tracy just got him to sleep after his latest fit at 0600.' The intern, who has her stethoscope poised, takes a step back to see if I was serious. I give her my Major Houlihan stare and she backs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst rounds include doing hands on assessment of the baby giving meds, doing 0800 labs, if ordered and feeds. Baby Girl A assessment looks good. \"Mmmm...... heart, lungs, bowels all sound good, skin color looks good, IV site looks ok. May need a restart later if we don't increase feeds.\" I keep a running commentary in my head so that I can remember what to chart in the assessment when I am done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I am done just in time as dear Baby Boy C is having his first fit. \"Wow 70%  O2 sat little guy\" I croon to the baby as I turn up his O2. He probably has a wet diaper because his heart rate is ok. He will not come back up without me changing him and holding him. I quickly change his diaper and swaddle him and hold him up in a bear hug. \"You little faker!!\" I laugh at him. He has immediate calmed and his color is returning to normal. O2 sat 97% He looks at me and smiles as I wean his O2 back to his normal range. I wonder how long I need to hold him till I can put him down and get his breakfast. Omygod! It\u2019s getting late 0930. I haven't charted his neighbor's assessment, done this boy's assessment and his breakfast is due now.<br>\r\nFortunately, Jennifer one our volunteers comes to my bedside.  \"Any babies to hold?\u201d she asked. I thrust Baby C into her arms and help her settle into the rocker. With any luck she can hold him while I feed and do an abbreviated assessment and I can get caught up. I run to the breast milk/formula room. I grab his special high cal formula from the fridge. I draw up the amount into a 60cc (2oz) syringe. I check my brain card (a card I took notes on during report check out) for meds and lab work. \"Cool. Not to late for 0900 meds\" I think as I gather them from the med cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I give my meds and finish Baby C's modified assessment, I am called to rounds. \"I can go after I hang this feeding. Can someone else go?\" I ask the other nurses in my area. Brad volunteers and grabs his charts for the rounding room.Hang a feeding? Yes Baby C, though now calm, is still working too hard with his breathing and the rate is above what I consider safe for bottle feeding. Merry, the charge nurse says it\u2019s like running a marathon as you suck through a straw. So for feedings, he has a G-tube: a surgically placed tube through the wall of his abdomen to his stomach. It saves the baby calories he would be using for breathing and eating to grow on. I start the warmed formula through a syringe pump as Jennifer continues to hold and cuddle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're ready for you in rounds,' says Brad as he cruises back to his assignment.<br>\r\nI smile and thank him as I gather my charts. I tell Brad to keep an ear out for Baby C as he is still eating and being held and Baby A should be fine. \"Will do\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walk to the rounding room, I muse over Brad's latest witticism about nursing after a bad day with demanding parents \"You know I got into nursing to help people and to make more money than being a waiter. What I didn't know was that nursing was wait staff without the tips. 'Get me a pillow, get me a drink of water, my baby is wet. Aren't you going to change him?' Not a please or thank you in the bunch and I'm here to teach them how to change diapers especially if they're 15!\" I smiled ruefully as I entered the rounding room. There was alot of truth in that rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounds in the NICU are not like on TV. It's not kindly doctors in white coats with adoring interns floating from beside to beside. Everyone rounds in one room. Everyone includes: the attending, the fellows, the residents, the interns, the pharmacist, the dietitian, the social worker, the nurse and sometimes the parents. The atmosphere in the room seems like controlled chaos at times but everyone wants the best possible outcome for the babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intern starts the ball rolling by giving out the vital stat of the day before, lab values, how baby did overnight. If something has changed since the intern has seen the baby or I notice something in my assessment, this the time for me to speak up. The attending listens, makes notes and guides the intern into making the plan of care for the day. Everyone gets a chance to ask questions or make suggestions. This is when routine orders are written so it saves time. Rounding on my two kids can take as long as 30 minutes between presentation and interruptions from other nurses with more critical babies who need orders or to ask questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally get done with rounds and return to my area. No major changes on my kids, so I can just cruise through the day, I hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigh.... Baby A's parents are here. I gotta get the translator for updates and teaching and look at the time. I'm missing lunch again. Look, we can talk later. What are you doing after lunch or do you actually get a lunch?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So let's go to a story of mine which is true where maybe you don't make much money but the thrill and excitement of helping others makes your heart swell up like the Gritches did when he made the decision to take Christmas back to Whoville.  I used to work as an office manager of a camp and conference center.  Although I had a hard time with some employees because they lacked to see my humor in bringing it to the work place.  I scheduled a group of mentally challenge adults to join the camp for a day of wonderful activities.  Oh, getting off the bus you saw such joy in each and every face.  Just the smallest item like getting up in the morning and having a cup of coffee with a priest, who is now a Bishop was all they could ask for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember they would come two weeks in the summer and my sister-in-law kept two older ones but they could live together.  When spring came Donnie the youngest one would start calling me on my day off.  It's getting warming, will camp be soon.  Hey, that guy who stole my socks last year, will he be there.  I was annoyed to know end.  This was my off day but it didn't matter to him in a few short months or short to me but very long to him he would be a his wonderful camp where last year he won the certificate for being the biggest flirt.  Oh, how they had fun while a lot of us complained about our jobs when our joy was right in front of us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, they attended camp about 3 years they were on there way up to their sixties.  Donnie had to go to the nursing home first so we assumed he would be the first to leave this earth for greener pastures.  They were abused as children.  His brother Wayne stayed in a mobile home not far from my sister-in-laws.  One day we got the call we dreaded.  Wayne was found in his trailer and they told us it was a heart attack.  I wasn't able to go to the wake but my husband sat next to Donnie.  Donnie didn't have tears he knew for certain his brother Wayne was in heaven looking down upon him.  Donnie looked to my husband and put his head on his shoulder and said, \"Tim, do you think I can go to Summer Camp this year even though my brother has gone to be with Jesus.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, little man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the case.

I'd come out of nursing and I later went into computer programming but the knitting was nice, and unusual.  People assumed we used knitting machines but it was the kind of knitting you get in women's magazines: knitting by hand.  Once two guys from the local CID (Criminal Investigation Department) came to talk to me [over a mix-up with my bus-pass; I don't mix with all those secret agents, murderers and pirates, anymore] and. when I told them I was a Hand-Knitter, they asked how I managed to fit in all the fingers.  Well, you know cartoonists generally draw only three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you want to know what it was like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were thirty of us in a room like a classroom, with a supervisor at the front.  We all had proper wooden three-drawer office desks with a lifting flap.  We had a tea towel on the desk, to protect the knitting from contamination, and another to protect our clothing from shed yarn.  We weren't supposed to talk loudly enough to spoil the Compilers' concentration (but the Compilers only stopped talking long enough to complete tricky calculations).  Occasionally, the supervisor changed the layout of the desks or moved everybody round, just like a teacher in school.  My friend and I sat next to each other and talked all day long so the supervisor moved us to opposite ends of the room, but she had to move us back because we shouted to each other, across all the intervening people.  All the knitters and compilers were women.  So were the designers.  All the managers were men, and the manufacturing, warehouse and clerical offices were mixed.  We were the prestige department and all the tours came through our room, including a coachload of Japanese Craft Shop owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were allowed to read while knitting, and write shopping lists, because it kept us quiet.  I wrote letters, quite a few poems and a couple of stories.  As long as I kept the pad under the corner of the cloth, the supervisor couldn't catch me and, as long as I produced the work (and kept quiet), she didn't want to.  We had to have a pad, to keep track of rows and stitches, so it was easy just to keep another pad next to it for story notes, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I hear you ask, what were we doing as our paid job?  Well, all those sweaters you wear, the good quality ones, have to be designed and knitted.  Knitting yarn manufacturers pay designers to design them, Compilers to write the instructions, Maths Checkers to check that the instructions work and Knit Checkers to check that the garment will come out like the designer's sketch.  The completed garments were photographed for the cover of the instruction leaflets.  And the whole Publications section existed to encourage people to buy our knitting yarn rather than that of a rival manufacturer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't just knit, and it wasn't all garments.  There was a six-month training period because we had to learn how to do all the different types of plain and fancy knitting stitches and fabrics, different types of shaping, different methods of joining the pieces together, as well as crochet and some embroidery.  It was apprentice training, although without recognition, and our work was classed as semi-skilled manual labour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good environment; friendly and free, with only occasional time-pressure, and I sometimes miss it.  One day, I hope there will be recognition for the skill which goes into this work, and certficates to prove it has worth.  After all, people will always need clothes and some people will always want to make them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't knit a jumper for a man with a 46 inch chest in under a month and, these days, I wouldn't want to start one.  But I can knit anything I want and adapt commercial instructions to suit my needs.  Four Christmases ago, I knitted a glove puppet which every kid recognised as Pikachu (using instructions for Postman Pat's cat).  I still learn new stitches when I want to.  And I intend to develop a course to pass on this knowledge, just like craftsmen always used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnitting allows expression for our creative side and, if anyone was offered a paid job doing a task they'd choose as a hobby, it wouldn't take too much thought to decide whether to take it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vegetables full of flavor and nutrition, only \"genetically modified\" by the pollinating bees. Raspberries fresh from the bush taste like they've been dipped in honey. They ate not the adulterated and poisoned freaks of natures we do today. They knew true peace. Receiving back in turn what they gave the land in their own sweat and sometimes blood. <br>\r\nYet people still buy my black eyed-peas for new years, and my mint in the spring. It seems something of the old ways will always be sacred, albeit in cute superstitions and old wive's tales.<br>\r\nIt's funny how something as simple as food is enough to make one reflect on the nature of tradition and culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm, I wonder how many hunters work in the meat department? </span></div></div>",

I know it may seem like being the \"boss\" of all the 3 thru 5 year olds is fun but truly it is not: sometimes. I have several categories in which i put my children in: I always have my leader, my bossy one, the crybaby, the one who tells all the home business, the bully, then there are the bullied, my protector, my tattle tells, my mister and misses know it all, my not so smart one, my name brand clothes wearers, to i know all my colors but no shape, and i know all my shapes but no colors, the liars, and the ones who tell the absolute truth, the the quiet one, even my abused children. You can tell alot about a child when you meet their parents. It can be sad some time cuz some parents really don't give a rats ass about their kids or their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love kids and there whole innocence is what draws me to this field of work. Most workers just want the money but truthfully there isn't much money in this field, its about the impact you made on this child's life whether you saved them from abuse at home or taught them to the best of your knowledge. When i started preschool I had no experience. My boss \"threw me to the wolves\" as i say. The kids didn't respect me @ all. I was afraid of them. I taught myself how to discipline my class. I made up lesson plans and activites and earned their trust and respect. They LOVED me!!! This occupation is rewarding....over and out!!!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been said that if you are too nervous to steal and too lazy to work, Law Enforcement is the field for you.  Don't believe it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being a police office is portrayed as a glamorous career on television, in real life I'd forget about the glamor.  More and more police agencies are looking for college graduates these days.  So if law enforcement is what you want getting a college degree is important. And, a degree in Criminal Justice is not always the answer.  The FBI hires a good number of Accountants as agents.  Ever hear of Embezzlement?  Public Relations and and almost any kind of Government major will also help a lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do we do?  Lets start where 99% of police officers begin...city, county, or state police.  There is an academy to get through. It is about 16-20 weeks long and you pay for it.  Years ago a person was hired by a police department and they sent him/her to the academy.  Now you attend the academy completely at your expense.  When you have that certificate in hand you are in fairly high demand.  Police departments are almost always looking for officers.  Police officers move from agency to agency fairly frequently during their career.  As a Rookie you are assigned to an experienced officer.  You will partner with him/her for 30 to 90 days, depending on the agencies policy.  The road patrol is the beginning.  We've all seen them with their blue lights flashing, the siren piercing the quiet.  That the high visibility part of the job.  The low visibility duties are going to Domestic Violence calls.  One of the most dangerous calls a police office answers.  Why?  Because emotions are high.  Someone in the argument is hurt, or their love has been spurned and rejected, and almost always, both people are angry.  It can make for a volatile situation.  Breaking up fights, chasing burglars, car chases, working accidents.  All are part of it, and dirty.  But there is another side to it.  Putting an end to someones troubles, finding a lost child, returning property to its owner, bringing justice to someone who desperately deserves it, and providing peace of mind to scared and terrorized people.  The rewarding duties.  While there is no way to know what percentage of good duties and bad duties you will have, for me, the good ones are the memories I kept.  <br>\r\nI have saved the life of a 7 year old boy, returned lost children to frantic children, and brought peace of mind to senior citizen housing by catching a burglar who terrorized them.  Those memories will be with me forever.  <br>\r\nPolice agencies operate 375 days a year, 24 hours a day.  You will miss alot of Christmas mornings at home, and you'll eat alot of late Thanksgiving dinners.  You'll miss birthdays, anniversaries, school plays and teacher conferences.  But you'll learn that because of what you do, people will understand.,  For every one person who would disparage you, there are 100 who support you. <br>\r\nLaw Enforcement, at whatever level, is a respected and honored profession.  While your muscles don't have to be big and powerful, it helps if your heart is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone has a question, or would like some information for a story they are writing, reach out, I'll be happy to help. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Greetings one and all, Sherri the Writer here. My day job is as a Program Assistant. Specifically, I license landscape architects and soil classifiers. I've been doing this since July 1999. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, let me explain what these professions are. Landscape architects are people who design outdoor spaces. Like an architect does the inside, landscape architects do the outside. You can see their work in parks, playgrounds, golf courses, and any outdoor area that is designed for public use. Soil classifiers basically so site evaluations of the soil in an area where people typically want to do development work. These are very simple definitions for complex professions. In fact, that's why they're licensed - because they're so specialized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning two licensure programs is administrative work, meaning I sit behind a computer and push paper most of the time. It's not bad work. It's great getting to know people and help them accomplish their professional goals. In fact, I think helping others achieve their dreams rubs off on you after a while - I know seeing their dedication and hard work motivated me to pursue my dream of being a writer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy typical day would probably be considered dull for most people - I come to work and get behind the computer to check my E-mail (that's how I get most of my correspondence). Usually it's processing applications, checking on applications in progress, verifying paperwork for people applying for licenses out of state, or processing license renewals if it's December - February. Each program has an advisory council that meets two to four times a year, and I usually organize those meetings and do the administrative follow up for them. Mainly, this is issuing license since people are reviewed and approved for licensure at these meetings, and following up on complaints (which are rare) and any other issues that we feel is important to the program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice a year I administer the registration exam for landscape architects. This takes a lot of organization and coordinating. Not only do I have to process applications for the exam, but I have to collect the money for the exam, place the exam order, and work with the coordinator for the site where we give the exam to get a contract in place for the next exam administration (I have an agreement set up with a certain place). Once the actual exam rolls around, however, it's pretty easy work. I pass out the exams, fill out some paperwork, and sit quietly for five hours while they take the exam. Since I can't have anything with a computer memory chip in the room with me (meaning no cell phones or laptops), I usually read or cross stitch to pass the time. Then once they're done, I check the booklets, confirm the paperwork, and pack it all up to ship when they're done. Giving the exam is usually a pretty easy day. The only bad part is that testing starts at 8:00 A.M. so I have to be at the test site by 7:30 A.M. to set up and in case they need to see me before testing starts. I'm not a morning person, so this is usually a cruel fate to an otherwise good day for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a year, I get to speak to the professional practice class at one of the state universities about the licensure law and the registration examination for landscape architecture. I remember I was so nerfous the first time I did it, but I'm getting used to it. It's good to meet the students and the professors in the program to get a different perspective to the profession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of my days are computer and paperwork, but that's ok. I actually have a bachelor's degree in psychology, but have found that this fits well with that degree. I still get to help people, even if it's in a much different way than I envisioned in college. In fact, I fell into administrative work when I decided to postpone graduate school to get married. I think the Lord was leading me in the right direction. This job has been such a great fit for me that I've decided to stay and pursue my writing instead of the advanced degree. So in the end, it all works out. I'm happy with my job and pursuing my dreams while helping others achieve their own. I feel like I'm in the ultimate win-win situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you just can't beat that!</span></div></div>",

I write this down, and turn on the meter. As I started to pull away from the city building, she struck a conversation with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh god, this was a hectic day.

I do CAD, which is Computer Aided Drafting, and instead of making a paper blueprint, we do it on the computer screen. (Sigh), I just get so tired of doing the same things over and over sometimes.

The best part of driving tho, is that I like to meet different people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I see the same people all of the time tho.\" She said in an exasperated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I could tell she was tired. Tired of working on her computer all day, so that her plans could be put into working action. It wasn't that long of a ride, only three miles, but I could tell she was going to take advantage of a bubble bath when she got inside of her house. Something to relax her. I could use a bubble bath too, come to think of it (giggles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You're the first lady cab driver I've seen,\" she said with a little surprise in her voice. \"Are there many lady drivers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"No not really. There's a few of us, and we have to take the remarks of the guys. You know how guys are. But, we give it right back to them too.\" We both giggled at that, because we both knew we had the same experiences with the guys we have to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    We got to her house, and she looked very tired and she sighed loud enough to let me know she was glad to be home. She paid the fare and got out, and walked slowly into her house. I had to think that she would be all right, after she had her bubble bath, and relaxed for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Taxi driving can be a pain, just like any occupation, but you get used to it, and the money you make and the people you meet, takes care of any boredom that may be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Yep...that was the beginning of new age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents were in the crossroads of their lives. My Dad had just retired from the military after 20 long years , the last two being a SGT Major in  the Vietnam conflict. (He had also served in Korea).  He was still a young man in his forties when he had several heart attacks.  Back then  people were not immediately put on medication, given caths, or even an every day heart by pass. The advise from the Military Physicians  was to \"chill\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that is what my parents did.  My Dad retired from the Army and just took part time and temp jobs. My parents became vegetarians, exercised daily and joined an alternative organization called The Foundation of Truth. Now even though it was 1968, this was quite out of the norm for a couple of middle aged folks living in the deep South. But they thrived as a couple, as healthy humans and as a community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey mentored us kids, even though we were old enough to sit back and question some of their techniques.  My little brother said that they were going to \"Ghost School\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on both sides of the fence.  I was going to Nursing School and was married to a technical, academic engineer who wanted nothing to do with this nonsense. With my parents help, I would sneak off to classes in meditation, past lives, tarot reading, and was even one of the first to complete the Reiki Masters Class in the South Eastern USA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents ran the healing clinic.  After a public non-denominational service, we would gather in the back room for the  private hands on healing sessions.  We would see everything from Cancer to diabetic ulcers, to arthritis, psoriasis, heart problems (both physical and emotional) and lots of other maladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the foundation was raided by the police. They took many people into custody for molestation.  The rules being that you could not touch anyone ,for any reason, below the head/neck unless you were licensed<br>\r\n to do so (for example, doctor, nurse, physical therapists, etc.) Hands on healing was against the law and punishable by our state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now decided to look into Chiropractic school as I could do my healing and no one would know that my healing force was an innate power that was in everyone (licensed or not). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many stories about my career<br>\r\n as a Chiropractor and how I went on to Medical school and now do research and lectures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there is another part of the story... I could not have done it without Mike. I met Mike in Nursing School.  Even though we were both married , I had a crush on him. He introduced me to the world of health food, and new age music, incense and natural healing.(this was a few years before my parent's change of life) Mike quit nursing school and went on to this new Chiropractic School in Marietta, Georgia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Mike and I only got as far as quiet study sessions,  a year later, I followed and later enrolled in  that small, new, and at that time non accredited Chiropractic College. I gave up everything...my husband, my savings , my family and friends,and sometimes I thought I had given up my mind. But it was the best thing I ever did, my life was totally changed forever.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I began as a recruitment person and have been handling Compensation &amp; Benefits for the past 18 odd months. In both my roles, the people interaction is high, though in different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA recruiter is under constant pressure to close positions. Its always about numbers. In the competitive job market, the supply never seems to surpass demand when it comes to being able to get the \"right person for the job\". It is a constant struggle to convince someone on the benefits to join your company when all your competitors are offering more or less the same bunch of benefits, career &amp; growth opportunities. In so many years of my hiring experience, the most fulfilling moment is when a candidate accepts your offer &amp; the next joyous moment is when he has joined as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a recruiter is always on tenterhooks, the most rewarding part of the job, are the words of gratitude that a recruiter receives when a candidate is informed about his selection. It is also a great feeling when a recruiter gets recognised by all their hires (though I must admit that I would not be able to recognise most of them!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other dimension of people interaction came when I moved roles &amp; became a part of the Compensation &amp; Benefits team. Sometimes I feel that handling your own employees is more challenging than an external candidate. That's because your employees have far more expectations from you and the organisation! You need a lot more patience to deal with them. Moreso when you are handling something as sensitive as someone's salary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have had friends, not in the HR fraternity, tell me that HR has it easy. That's so far from the truth! Managing aspirations, setting expectations, convincing employees that there is indeed a career for them in the company, handling miscreants who feel that they can flout a few rules in the company &amp; get away with it, consoling an employee who feels injustice has been done to him/her, showing appreciation to an employee who has gone beyond the call of duty - all these are just some examples of the multiple roles that HR needs to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I would still say that HR is a fulfilling career. How many times in life do we get a chance to make a difference in somebody else's life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I deal with many sick people everyday, dying and those who get well. Some people have high regards on us but that's not really flattering. It's just sad that whenever we're the ones who are sick, we're not being taken care of. Some even mock us, and try to laugh just to say, \"You know what to do! Take care of yourself!\" We're always ready to give care to others and yet, nobody cares about us. When people need us, we're always available. But when we need someone, we see no one by our side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes I get tired and wish that I could turn back the hands of time and choose another profession. Perhaps I could become an engineer because I do good in math and graphics. But when my little sister got really sick, I thanked God for giving me skills to care about the people that are dear to me. I am very happy that I became a nurse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this profession, I have seen cruel sides of life. I found out that this profession is not just plainly assisting someone who is sick to get well in his physical aspects. The very crucial role I get to play is to stand as a source of strength to those who grieve because they lost someone, and a source of peace and contentment for those who accepted to let go. Being able to reach others' hands is a big deal even just by merely standing beside them and listening to their stories. I learned to become strong and absorb people's sentiments and anger. I learned to become gentle... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever I get a smile from my patients, it's more than any monetary reward I could ever receive.  The best gift I consider in this world is to be considered as someone socially relevant.For the first time in my life, I found a path that would definitely define the worth of my existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there will be nobody to take good care of me, I can always count on God to do that for me. For now, I wanna make this path I have chosen into a journey that makes this life worth living.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I started working in many types of health care related jobs early on most of which were not glamorous. I didn't get a diploma. After several years learning the ropes from so many different types of jobs, nursing homes, retirement villa's, private sitting (with elderly), I felt that I could use with a change. <br>\r\nI applied for a job at a Center that had several Group Homes for the mentally and physically challenged adults in my area. It was a very hard job, most of the clients couldn't speak verbally and unless you worked with them a lot you wouldn't know that their eye's spoke volumes.<br>\r\nI began on the lowest level rung of the ladder and got the hardest jobs. Of course I did ask for them, I wanted to know if I was cut out to take care of such special people. Often becoming frustrated, not so much with the clients but myself. I did love the job very much. <br>\r\nOne of my first days on the job I remember going into work worn out from the day before. I was signing in after I entered the room and one of the verbal clients came up to me telling me how their day went. Then it seemed like I was fitting in. We would take the company vans out and ride around. The clients liked being out in the community but really loved it when the chances arose for us to take drives in the country.  <br>\r\nThere was never a dull moment working with them. One client in particular loved to be nude anywhere, anytime, no warning just off came the clothes. There was even a time at our local park someone was having a child's birthday party and my clients started a major food fight with the birthday boy. All in fun no one was angry they just played and laughed. <br>\r\nOne day you may go to work and receive a ton of hugs and then the next you may have to defend yourself from an agitated client. It was mostly great working with them. You come across a wide array of people in that field. Some who understand what its like to have a disabled family member, some I admit scoff and mock them. Which I was never good at handling, I had a temper when it came to my clients. <br>\r\nStrangers would often walk up to us on the street and tell me I must have been some kind of special to chose this job out of all the jobs. I would just tell them I don't feel special I just think it this way if this was my son or daughter I would want to know someone was taking care of them as well as I do.<br>\r\nMost of the staff are a great bunch of people, but in the health care business of mental retardation they aren't too trusting. I mean they are the advocates of the clients they care for. That's the same thing as you handing over your child to the first homeless guy you see and saying \"Be back in a couple of days\". It doesn't work out.<br>\r\nThe hardest part of working in any health care setting I have found, is when you lose a client. Especially one you have been with a very long time. I still remember the first time I went to work and was told one of the clients had passed away. I wanted to cry but I couldn't the other clients wouldn't have understood. But when the day was over and I sat in my car I cried the whole way back home. Each day after it never felt quiet the same, seeing the clients room with no one sitting there drinking their caffeine free Dr. Pepper asking about my son, joking about anything and everything. The world felt a little more empty or at least my part of the world did. Eventually you grow a thick skin, it isn't impenetrable but it helps. It doesn't make you cold just human with a little protection added.<br>\r\nI have never forgotten one person I have taken care of. I miss them a lot and think of them often. <br>\r\nI think if your looking for a fulfilling job whose benefits often come in hugs or the joy you see on a persons face just because you came to work this is a good starting point. <br>\r\nAnyway this is my work story, truthful and direct. I hope you enjoyed reading this. </span></div></div>",

Back when I was in seventh grade I began confirmation in the Lutheran church.  We had to do some service to the church (aka accolyting and/or volunteering in the nursery).  I chose to do both.  And I did both regularly, although I was more of a regular volunteer in the nursery.  I spent time in the nursery and acolyting during eighth grade.  During my freshman year of high school, I continued to volunteer in the church nursery.  Then my sophmore year the nursery coordinator hired me as nursery staff.  At that time minimum wage was 5.15/hr, so I didn't make much, but I had a ton of fun!  I still work in the church nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've gotten to see kids grow up right in front of my eyes.  Some of them I've known since their birth, and they are now nearly ten.  The days I see those kids coming in to want to help out or just revisit a place with so many childhood memories, I find myself thinking \"geez, I'm getting old.\" even though that isn't remotly true.  Then there are the regulars who you get to know so well.  Each of the regulars bring an interusting dynamic to the nursery.  There's the boy who has regular temper tantrums.  There's the girl who hates it if she doesn't get her way most of the time, and doesn't like it if she doesn't have someone to play with.  Theres a boy who loves making faces.  Theres a boy alleric to nuts who loves to draw and loves the movie \"Toy Story\".  Then there are the girls who love to paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've had to break up fights amoung kids.  Clean up all the paint on the tables on floor from splatter painting is a regularity for me.  I've changes smelly diapers.  I've delt with kids who throw up.  I've been urped up on multipul ocasions in a single four hour period by a single child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the foster kid who came in one day who was the one of the happiest kids I've ever seen.  The only time he got a little grouchy was when I changed his diaper.  Poor kid.  What did he go through to cause that?  And there was the foster kid who came running back in for a moment just to give me a hug and a kiss.  The moments when a kid gives you a hug and/or kiss make the work of keeping kids safe and happy worth it.  The smiles you get when a kid has fun makes it worth it.</span></div></div>",

I just make as many as I can and they don't mind as long as the basket isn't completely empty.

Not too many people visit these days and my mountainside town which once flourished with tourism revenue is feeling the burn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the monks have not stop paying for their monthly order and my shop has been having me work my usual schedule.

When you're at sea for over half the year, you don't typically have time for long-term relationships. No. The sea is your wife, and your love. She is your mother and a killer. But no matter what, you know that she's beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was younger, I had no idea what I wanted to be. I'd lived in the wonderful state of Maine my entire life, a place where there truly aren't that many lucrative, high-octane jobs going around. We didn't have that many enormous businesses in my state. Certain department stores (one that starts with \"W\" and ends with \"mart\") have been severely detrimental to most of our ma and pop stores. Furthermore, I never could see myself as a full time worker - I'm a dreamer at heart. Being a lawyer or a doctor just wasn't for me; being a businessman is practically out of the question in Maine. But then there's the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Atlantic's been within spitting distance of me my entire life; perhaps it's one of those things that I've taken for granted. She's a thing of majesty that cannot adequately be expressed by the words of even the world's greatest poet. There is no thought or word to define her, but you can feel her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd never thought about shipping before my senior year of high school. I had always been anxious about my future. I found Maine Maritime Academy, and it changed my life forever. I'm not going to say that I'm a greedy man, or even that money is the most important asset in my life. What I will tell you is that I make a lot of it. I probably make more than your family physician does, and I also get nearly half the year off without any work obligations: free time to do whatever it is that I want. Please don't think that I'm bragging until you've read the rest of this.... chapter..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA typical day in my life is that nothing is typical. I stand watch on the bridge of my ship every eight hours. Watch usually lasts for four hours unless the ship is getting ready for port, in which case the second mate and I have to cover the first mate's watch while he inspects the tanks. Weather can change nearly as fast as you can think. You quickly understand that nothing in the world is unpredictable. The sea can be still as glass one moment, and then minutes later, unleash aquatic hell. Even while docked, lines can part, people can be injured or killed, and malfunctions in any system could cause disaster for you or the environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be asked what a typical day entails is to ask me the nature of the sea; to that I must say that each day, like the sea, is unpredictable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm on land, I have four months to do whatever I wish, with more money than most people would spend in four months (let alone a year or two... or three). But there is an enormous price. ENORMOUS. It's love. Looking back, I would rather have a career that would allow me to be with someone. My time away gives me no chance to establish the ties that are needed to fall truly, deeply in love. It really comes down to this: What is worth more to you: adventure and money, or a person who loves you? In retrospect, I'd choose love any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are still many opportunities out there on the ocean. Many of them don't require you to be away for such a time. So it's not all bad. I, myself am thinking about transferring to a supply vessel in the gulf in order to get more time off (two weeks on the ocean, two weeks off). Perhaps then, I will be able to balance my career with my desires. Sailing is fun and adventurous while you are young, but when it comes time to find what really matters, you'll need to stop and reflect: what do you really want? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I work in the transportation industry. I have many bosses. As one of them recently said to me, \"You take things too personally. We're not transporting Lungs and Hearts. If the load doesn't get delivered, it's not life-or-death.\"<br>\r\nBut he's right. I DO take things personally. (Don't know about the word \"too\" though!) Everything is important. Even if it's just dog food or mulch to grow potatoes, it's important enough to be trucked somewhere. Right? I believe so.<br>\r\nBy saying I have many bosses, I mean the following: I work in Maryland, for the Baltimore office, but I dispatch loads to drivers for the Norfolk, Virginia and Savannah, Georgia terminal managers. They are Mike and Chet, respectively. Mike is the one who said the silly thing about hearts and lungs. In most cases, I'm given a set of circumstances and need to fulfill them to finish my day. Quite often, I'm given a bit of warning. Other times, I'm given a surprise. I'll give you some examples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChet has a driver delivering in Florence, Kentucky this morning. Last Friday, I was able to find him a load that picked up only 7/10ths of a mile away (which is extremely rare). That's called a \"deadhead\", wherein the driver must go from his point of delivery to his point of pickup, without anything in his trailer. (Oh, I move VANS, which are the covered trailers most people see when they drive the highways. I do not move the flatbed trailers, where you can see what the load is, or at least see something is covered with a tarp.) After his deadhead, he picks up the load, in this case, in Florence, KY and is supposed to be delivering tomorrow in Manning, SC. But when he goes to pick it up, I get a call from the company who I booked it with, and they say, \"We made a mistake. The load is really going to York, SC. Do you still want it?\" So I have to negotiate a new rate to move the load to a different place. In this instance, I'm lucky the driver didn't have a load waiting for him in nearby Charleston, SC, which was the original reason I'd booked the load. Also luckily, the company who gave me the load (called a \"broker\") said they'd pay me the same amount of money to go a shorter distance, to give me some relief. Otherwise, I'd have to say NO to the load and find something else heading to Charleston, SC. In this case, I said YES and then started looking for something that would pickup near York, SC on Tuesday that would deliver in either Savannah or Charleston. I got lucky there too. I found a load within 50 miles that went directly to Savannah. That is also rare, in that I had no \"deadhead\" to home base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike has a driver delivering in Humboldt, Tennessee this morning. I have a way to \"post\" the driver on a load board, so that other \"broker\" companies can find me and help me move him along. This driver has to return to Norfolk, Virginia, or within 100 miles of it, so he can take another load to Tennessee in a couple of days. The broker who calls me offers me a pickup that is 118 miles away in New Albany, Mississippi, that finishes in a town called Ahoskie, North Carolina, which is 65 miles deadhead back to home in Chesapeake, VA. The pay isn't quite what I need it to be, so I ask for more money. Eventually, the broker tells me they can meet my dollar figure and we \"book the load\". He sends me a piece of paper to sign and fax back to him. Then I send it down to my boss Mike, so he can let his driver know. Well, Mike actually had a pair of drivers in Humboldt today, so he got to choose which one would get this load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked all day to find loads for all my drivers. But I still have one guy who will be in San Antonio, Texas on Tuesday, who really needs to get back to Savannah by the end of the week. There are several problems with this. One, the rate of pay from San Antonio is terrible in comparison to other pickup areas. The \"ends of the country\" don't pay as much as the middle parts. Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Miami, Florida are examples of bad areas to ship from; mostly the brokers know that the drivers are desperate to get out of those areas, and therefore, do not pay a great amount of money to move the loads. Whereas I could get a rate of $2.00 per mile from Memphis, TN to Norfolk, VA; in San Antonio, TX, a load going to Atlanta, GA pays 85 cents per mile. Quite a difference!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enjoy what I do, even though my wife and co-workers think I'm nuts. I do this every weekday and care for each and every one of the loads I book. I care for the drivers too. I love my job and am very good at it. New workers come in and say in extreme confidence, \"You better not go on vacation. I can't possibly do what you do.\" But coworkers say, \"You spend too much time on the phone. Get the person off the phone.\" They say that because I seem to be the only one people call for, day in and day out. But my theory is this: I'm talking to a potential customer and am not about to kick them to the curb because someone else is calling me. It's not my fault that three people called me at once. Other people could possibly help, but choose not to help. So all the calls are for me and usually one out of every six is a call I really didn't need to take anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, I have a driver in Humboldt, TN that needs to go to Norfolk, VA. Every day! I got a call today from someone who wanted me to take their load to Brooklyn, NY. I mean, come ON, people! No matter how far away you get from the map, the miles between Brooklyn and Norfolk are the same. I can't really send my driver to a place that isn't within 100 miles of Norfolk, even if it does \"pay well\". So, if the coworkers would simply screen the calls, I wouldn't have to answer all of them all the time. But I'm not bitter. Most of the time! Okay, I AM bitter, but only at my clueless co-workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've established a rapport with most of my customers (brokers) and they know me better because of that. I'd rather talk to a customer about innocuous things than kick them off the phone so I can do more of my job. The customer will give me the job, if I ask the right people. But if I simply tell them that others are waiting for me, it makes them think they are less important in my eyes. And that is never good to hear.</span></div></div>",

I'm in an four-year long apprentinceship, but I practically do everything the senior electricians do already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hiring process for my position is very lengthy, because it is a federal job. You have to take a series of computer tests(having a degree or being a college student would definitely help you), and then you have do a physical fitness test(to see if you can climb in and out of a confined space), have a hearing, seeing, and physical done, and once you pass all of that, you finally get interviewed by a board of big-wigs, general foremans and supervisors who you'll be working for. You also have to have a clean record, because a federal background check will be run on you. Even having bad credit is nothing to sniff at if you want this job. The whole hiring process takes about four months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're patient enough to go through the hiring process, the job is reletively easy once you get the hang of things. Since I'm an apprentice, I have to take a year and a half of technical classes, such as CAD(Computer Aided Drafting), Trignometry, and AC/DC electricity, in addition to my work schedule. It's nice the way it's set up, because with a two weeks at work/two weeks at college schedule, I don't have to worry about juggling work with school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy job deals with providing temporary power to vessels who come into dock. Anything they need, like extra lighting, or extra power, I provide for them. It's a great position if you like variety, and you like working outdoors. Some days I'm outside providing power to a vessel, other days I'm inside my shop repairing circuit breakers, and other days, I'm walking around and making a report on repairs that need to be made to equipment. Plus I get to operate machinary like generators, booms, and cranes. It's a great job to have, considering by the time my apprenticeship is over I'll be making $20.50 an hour, which will only go up from there(I make $15.00 as an apprentice right now). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you like working with your hands, troubleshooting, and working with ships, than this the job for you!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is not entirely true but yes, I did love my job for a little while. The latest job I had to be precised. I've been working in the dining room on board the cruise ship since 2011. People usually get into some weird mood when I tell them what was my job because they can't wrap the thoughts around the idea of working on the ship, especially in my country where this isn't one of the common jobs and something you listen about on a daily basis. To be honest, I don't even know how did I finish working there. I only remember it was easy to get it because the interview for such position didn't require some crazy skills nor experience. <br>\r\nEver since I was in primary school I dreamed about doing something unusual, something that not many people would or could do. Before I applied for this job I used to work in a bookstore. It was nice but the salary was low and I felt bored most of the time because there was no any action during the day. So, a friends and I were hanging out over at my place and the conversation we had turned toward careers and stuff. One friend of mine just suddenly mentioned job on the cruise ship because she knew someone from her college who got job there and before I even knew it I was holding a phone number of the agency that hires people for jobs on the ship. I called them the next day and made an appointment for the interview without even telling anyone. When I sorted everything out, when I sent documentation, I called my parents and told them about my plans. I'm not American which meant I had to travel and literally live in different country during my contract so it's, kind of, hard when you call your parents and tell them you're going abroad and that you won't see them for a whole year. Of course, they were okay with it and I was already old enough to make my own decisions. Only two months later I was already on my way to my very first job and new life adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShip's experience is hard to explain to someone who has never worked on one. Most of the people think about it as a great opportunity to travel the whole world and consider crew members lucky for it. While this job has its charms it also has its flaws. Yes, we indeed travel the world and see things that average human with ordinary job on land wouldn't see during his entire life but the crew members pay the high price for it by being away from everything and everyone they love- home and family. Length of the contracts depend on the cruise line you work for as well as department and your position. For example, officers on board usually have four months contract and two months vacation, waiters, stewards and just overall bar and restaurant department have eight months contracts and two months vacation. Some departments have six months contracts and two months of vacation.. like I said it depend on the job you are performing and cruise line company. It can happen that your position is unique on board and company has unique schedule for you. This happens with cruise directors, HR directors, captains, and few engine officer positions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day in life of a waiter on board is pretty busy. We used to make jokes saying how, to us, every day is Monday because at the ship no one has a full day off, like, ever. Everyone work every single day of their contract. One working day for a waiter usually starts at 7 am and finish around 10 pm with few short breaks in between. But it depend also of the schedule. Since the restaurant department is one of the biggest departments on board, shifts are split of course so it never happens that you work morning shift every day during one contract or even one cruise. In my company we had three positions for waiters: head waiter, team waiter, and assistant team waiter. One ship had two dining rooms and Lido deck (open buffet) so those three positions are split on each. For example, head waiters mostly had schedule to work breakfast (7-10 am), lunch (12-2 pm) and dinner in the dining room (6-10 pm) together with team waiters while assistant team waiters followed <i>Lido deck schedule</i>- breakfast 7-10 am, lunch 12-3 pm, and dinner they would work with head waiters and team waiters. Sometimes also Lido deck schedule had different working hours, especially when the ship is docked in a certain place or when we had midnight buffet therefore everyone had different schedule. Overall, there supposed to be around 10 working hours on days when you don't have off time and 5-6 working hours on days when you HAVE off time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a crew member means changing your lifestyle completely. It's hard at the beginning because you need to adjust yourself to the working atmosphere, fact that you are going to work with people from all over the world who speak different language, have different habits etc. and also fact that you are going to be on the water 90% of time. But once you get on a roll it becomes easier of course. After some time you get used to ship life so much that you start to feel weird when being on land. Even walking on the steady ground may seem weird sometimes because at the ship you're always moving. I also had little bit of troubles when passing by strangers on the street. At the ship we all smile and greet even if we don't know each other, because we know we are still colleagues, living and working under the same roof. But smiling and greeting strangers on the street doesn't work that way. I mostly have to remind myself that I can't greet random strangers on the street for the reason I may look like crazy to them or something and because it's not natural, it is something that people just don't do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite fact that average crew member work 10 hours per day, 8-6 months in a year, I can still say that it's possible to find enough of time for personal enjoyment. Crew members mostly enjoy even more than the guests in port because most of the time we know where to find the best fun on shore. For example, my first contract I spent in Mexico. We were basically every week in Cozumel and when you visit some place so many times you learn a lot about it and you never finish being on the same beach, or the same restaurant, mall etc. I literally know Cozumel like my own house because I explored 85% of the island. I've been to Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Jamaica and many other countries I can't even remember. It is interesting to learn about different cultures, to visit historical sites, meet local people and have a conversation of some sort with them. This is something I dreamed about ever since I was in school. I always felt like I don't belong to just one place and that I need to look for something new all the time. Job on the cruise ship made my dreams come true and I realized that you can really have whatever you dream about if you are brave enough to pursuit it <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There are many names for what I do, depending on what state or country you live in. I happened to do my training in Montana, which calls us CNAs. In Michigan, where I currently hang my hat, we are called CeNAs (pronounced seena). But whatever you call us, the job is the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't do this job for the money, because there is hardly any money in it. However, there are many other rewards that come with the job, not the least of which is personal satisfaction for having made someone's life better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCNAs have a very difficult job. It's back-breaking, sweaty, muscle-pulling work. When you punch the time-clock and get on the floor, you'd better not have forgotten your deodorant that day, because no matter what the temperature is outdoors, you will break a sweat before you have your first resident out of bed. And most times, you have anywhere from 10 to 20 residents to take care of before 8 am, which is breakfast time at our facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe start day shift at 6 am, and have to get our residents up and dressed and into the dining room for breakfast. This entails everything from dressing the resident from the skin out, to giving showers to the ones that have them before breakfast. Time management is obviously very important in this job. After that is done, a couple of aides stay in the dining room to help serve the meal and assist in feeding residents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are usually 4 aides on a shift, so the other two are on the hall, serving the residents who stay in their rooms to eat. Then there is other work on the hall to do, like making beds, tidying rooms, checking oxygen concentrators, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, there are more showers to give, people to help get ready for doctor appointments, people to help ambulate, help get to activities, and miriad other things that we who are independant and not living in nursing facilities take for granted every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we are done doing all that, it is time to get our people ready for lunch. This is not as time-consuming as the breakfast rush, because everyone is already dressed. Basically, we have to help people get to the toilet, comb their hair, wash their hands, and take them to the dining room. Then we help serve the meals and feed the people who can't feed themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, we help people to the toilet again, take care of any showers we may have missed or people tried to refuse, and check oxygen concentrators again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the shift, we have to chart what each of our charges did that day, and we have to do it as accurately as possible. This is very important because the information we provide is used to make care plans for the next month or 3 months, 6 months, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're a CNA, you have an important job. You're helping people live and retain their identity, independance, dignity, and self-esteem. You always have to be professional, and remember that these are people you are taking care of, just as if you were caring for your parents or grandparents. It's a difficult, rewarding, challenging, and interesting job, and I love it. I am proud to be a CNA.</span></div></div>",

Yes, the work is hard but oh so worth it.  It is the giving of your heart...it is the heart of giving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flip side of my work is as a beauty consultant.  To share with someone my time and skills, to help them feel better about themselves, to enrich their lives in some way through pampering skin care and the beauty of color.  To uplift them on a down day...to inspire them to reach for more.  This work is more of a ministry than it is a job.  My main goal is not to sell product..it is to make someone else feel important and beautiful through the art of pampering and service.

I was trying not to say anything.  I was trying to keep my cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the roach lost its grip and fell in my lap, it was all over.  I screamed bloody murder and scared everyone, including the driver, half to death as I started jerking around and trying to slap the insect off of my lap.  The car came to a screaching halt and I bolted out in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the offending insect was removed, I got a good scolding from my brother for being such a girl.

It leaves you filled with one of the world's sweetest smells...there is no chiropractic treatment, no Yoga exercise, no hour of meditation in a music-throbbing chapel that will leave you emptier of bad thoughts than this homely ceremony of making bread.\u201d - M.K.F Fisher<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is approximately midnight. I am on my way to work. Most people my age are still out partying or asleep in their beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm twenty years old, and I work as a baker. Baking is a precise science, and it requires so much patience, love, and absolute feeling that very few people do it anymore. I am the last of a dying breed, I know, so I try that much harder to show people what they will be missing if the species dies out for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI switch on the lights and the ovens and toss the keys to the bakery on a hook in the office. It's not my office, but maybe someday. I pull a white apron down from the wall and secure it tightly around my waist. It's time. I weigh flour and water, fresh yeast and salt, sugar and sometimes even a little bit of dried fruit, butter or honey. All of the ingredients go into the mixer at the appropriate time until it looks and feels like I know it should. It is removed from the mixer bowl, and it is allowed to ferment. I do this for every dough on the rotation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am alone for two hours before the rest of my crew arrives. The bakery is very small so there are only two other people working in the kitchen with me. Gregory is in his early thirties. He used to work at some big corporate gig, but he hated it and we lucked out. Peter is young, just seventeen, and he still training so I have to watch over him at times. He gets frustrated easily when the dough does not work like he wants it to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doughs are ready, they are divided, weighed, and shaped into loaves and rolls, all by hand. Then, they are allowed to proof. We bake other things too. We bake a few varities of muffins, cookies, and scones. We bake cakes for birthdays and weddings. Nothing is quite as sweet or rewarding as the breads though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe retail portion of the bakery opens at 6:00 AM. The owner and his wife arrive earlier to brew coffee and set up the cash register. There is a line outside of the door before it is unlocked. By 8:00 or 9:00 AM, I will be heading back to my apartment, with flour clinging to everywhere. I'll take a shower. I'll have some breakfast. I'll call my mother back; she calls me everyday... and I'll go about the rest of my day wishing that I could still be baking bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love what I do.</span></div></div>",

But I LOVE to act, and so I do. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average day for me is getting up, having breakfast, and then driving to work. Once there, I do odd jobs, usually: hem a costume, help someone with their lines, paint a piece of the set, whatever. By nine, I'm in the \"rehersal room\" where I practice my lines for as long as I need to. After I get out, I head to the costume room and A) get fitted to my costume, B) tell my costume maker what needs to be fixed on my costume, or C) model my costume, sometimes practicing in it. Then I go and help with the sets, saying where they should go, etc. Then, my lunch break! I come back around 12:30 or 1:00, depending on the day. That's when the REAL rehearsing starts! The actors get together and the director has us run through the current show. He always stops us at whatever time and gives us feedback, or sometimes writes it down and hands us each a copy to practice with. Then we have time to give suggestions to everyone. Afterwards, I go to my private lesson, where I act out a scene from the show with the director. After a singing lesson and a choreographer date, I go home to write. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome days it's different. On the day after a show, we have time off. A few days after one, work will resume, and we'll get a new show. Auditions are held the next day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther days, it's the SHOW DAY! That is really hectic. Goes like this: Upon getting to the theater, I meet up with every actor. We go through the show and really give suggestions. Then the director gives us a pep talk. We have group lessons, then go order lunch. After lunch, we change into our costumes in our respective changing rooms. After that, they do all the tech checks. Then we do a few scenes in costume, and finish lat-minute things fast. Our average time for the show is 6:00. We usually hang out there or go home to chill for awhile until showtime. Then everyone's running around and soon we hear someone announcing the show and regulations of the theater. And then we go!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing is not as glorified as it sounds. It takes teamwork and cooperation. Everyone has to do well for the show to do well. And we don't get paid amazingly. Plus, there's some major down-time, and it's hard to audition. There are many disappointments. But it's actually just like writing! There's blockages, hard work, and rejection. But it is all great fun. I love acting and writing, and I like my job. Acting is really an experience.~~~~~</span></div></div>",

Its mostly customer service, getting the customer in and out as fast as possible with their purchases or fuel tickets.  Knowing how to do the cashier's job as well as getting your crew to do what you ask them to do.  It's pretty great sometimes.  My store has a lot of Police prescence so I don't have to worry about being robbed again there.  I guess its a good thing to know most of the officers in the county.  When I was at a previous store I was robbed at gunpoint, the assailant is still on the loose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy store has a Subway inside of it, its pretty convient for lunch.  It also has the Truck drivers as we have High speed diesel pumps.  My favorite is our regular customers not so much the truck drivers.  The bathrooms need attention constantly and in my store specifically there are not enough labor hours to keep a full time maintenance person on hand.  So, either cashiers or myself do a lot of the clean-up work.  Including the trash, bathrooms (if you think yours is bad try cleaning a public one), sweeping and mopping the store, emptying the ash trays, sweeping the parking lot etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this type of business like most there is always something to be done.  Stocking shelves, making coffee, stocking cups or putting more hot dogs on the grill.  I think I hate stocking the cooler the most especially in the winter.  Most Convience stores have a walk in cooler to stock drinks from the back.  Cans are always soo cold even gloves can't seem to keep your fingertips warm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of a manager's worry is that the counting the money at the end of the day and it not matching what the computer says you're supposed to have.  With the BIG Truck fuel one mistake could cost the store $500.00 +  easy.  When it comes out wrong it takes a lot of time usually to find who made the mistake and what they did specifically.  Then determing whether or not it can be fixed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the other duties include: entering invoices, Ordering product, verifying the order with the invoice (all items received) getting credit for the things not received. Communicating with home office so that all the paperwork is turned in properly, doing a fuel survery (checking your competitors pricing twice a day).  Changing fuel signs (putting up then going up a ladder and manually changing the sign or using the stick that doesn't STICK to the letters half the time) , Hiring and fireing, coaching/counseling, staying within the Store's labor budget, but scheduling so that you can be a manager.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMY favorite of all is your salary, take the time you spend there and divide it out by what you make in the week.  It's usually less than what you pay your cashiers, not only are you responsible for their actions but the whole store.  Not to mention you're on call 24/7 try planning your life around your store... just wait till someone calls out.  You never know when you will have to show up... 1am 3am 6pm.  In the time I've been here I've pulled many double shifts 16+ hours in a day; a few times at least 4 I've pulled more than 24 hours because of my staff not being able to make it in.    With this company I would say being a Convience Store Manager sucks.  But I have heard tales of other ones being alright, with plenty of hours for their employess and Managers with 2 days off each week.  I can't remember my last day off that was ACTUALLY a day off no calls from my employees with problems, not having to go in for one reason or another.  Good Luck with your Job search.</span></div></div>",

There is a lot of hard work that goes on behind the scenes, especially when running a small, independent art cinema which is situated between two other cinemas owned by the biggest chains in the country!  Yes, it is easy to feel marginalized and dwarfed!  But despite all that, I endeavor to bring the very best, most interesting and worthwhile films to the screen so that audiences have an opportunity to see stuff that may not be so high profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProgramming is a big part of my job, and is the most fun and the most frustrating part.  There are a huge number of films released each week and distributors place them in appropriate cinemas.  I have to convince the distributors that my cinema is the place they <i>have</i> to place the titles I want.  In order to know what I want, I have to watch a lot of movies.  Sounds great, but a lot of the time the films are not that good which makes it all the more wonderful when you see something that actually is!  Maintaining excellent relationships with the film distributors is imperative.  Getting films is highly competitive and sometimes it is your personal relationship that makes the difference between getting a title and not getting one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have three screens here which makes scheduling multiple titles possible.  Each Monday I have to write a schedule for the week beginning Thursday, placing each film into a time-slot that will best suit that film's audience.  Distributors usually have session demands as part of the contract for screening the film, so scheduling can get extremely tricky at times, especially if we have a festival or other event on.  Once the times are locked in, everything else can begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPublicity is another huge part of the job.  The films we screen are usually not blockbusters and do not get TV advertising, huge billboards or anything like that.  Sometimes we don't even get a poster!  Pre-release date I try to get the most exposure possible by direct-marketing to groups or organizations that may be interested in the film's subject matter.  For example, today we are opening a film about marathon running so I have sent information to all the running and athletics clubs in the area and arranged for a specialist running shoe shop to put flyers in their bags.  We also did a preview screening last night to which I invited all the marathon luminaries I could find- a surprising number!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good relationship with the media is key.  Our local paper only reviews 2 or maybe 3 films per week, and some weeks up to 9 films are released.  So getting the reviewer in front of our film before his Wednesday afternoon deadline is important!  Radio journalists who talk about films, street press reviewers and radio DJs are also important contacts to have.  Upon finishing the schedule each week, I send it to all the media contacts I have so they know what is coming up that week, and can figure out how to see our films within their own deadline period.  Luckily I am often suppled with \"screener\" DVDs that I can give to journalists so they can see the film, even if it is not screening at a time that suits them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as all of this, there is the front-of-house work, serving customers, making coffee and supervising close-knit team as well as ordering and controlling the stock held in our bar and candy-bar area.  Plus organizing and running events of all sizes and types.  As our cinema has three different spaces, we are used for live music, theatre, conferences, weddings, parties and almost any other event you can think of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a challenging job, especially as I am the only full-time employee.  It often feels as though there are not enough hours in the day to get everything done.  But I love what I do.  I have a wonderful bunch of people to work with who are interesting, creative and talented.  I get to watch a lot of fantastic films and I have the opportunity to use a wide range of my own talents and skills.  Everyday is different, and everyday I get to meet new people.  I take pride in my support of local film makers, and their work. I hope that my contribution is beneficial to New Zealand's small-but-growing film industry.</span></div></div>",

And yes, I'm a native.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process of making those foils in your kitchen-drawer is large and complicated, involving electric-conducting rods and some other techno-babble that I'm not familiar with. I'm just a small cog in a big clockwork, your basic labor worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all plants work the same way, but I can give you an insight into one of them. My place in the compound is the rod factory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe basically receive used rods from a part of the plant where the aluminum is created (in so-called \"tubs\"), clean them, demolish and recycle. Transporting the rods through the factory is done by \"forks\", which hang from a suspended rail system that connects all the stations in the factory. If they are also damaged from the use in the aluminum-process, they're recycled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job is actually rather exciting. Me and my fellow workers are on a cycle through the factory so you don't have to do the same thing on every 8-hour shift (thank God!). I will admit that I'm not in great physical shape so I perform sluggishly on some stations and better on others. If you intend on working in an industrial environment, you'd better have the endurance for it. Ladder-climbing and wielding sledge-hammers is not for a faint heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great thing about this place though, are the co-workers. If your stuck on cleaning the forks in a certain stage and are completely exhausted (this is done by hand, I try to keep details to a minimum so not to confuse/bore you), you can always ask for help. I sometimes have to fight my ego, but it's always better to ask for assistance than to screw up big time. The reason for this is that there is rarely a deadline of sorts in this place, our main objective is to keep the stock of fresh rods up and then everything's a-okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stations range from smelting the conduit-ore to the forks to transporting the ore and fresh/used rods.  Everyone here has a favorite, I think. My personal favorite is anything that has to be done with the use of forklifts, trucks or other vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part about this job is the people you work with and get to know. There's nobody you can't talk or listen to. It may be a dirty and tiring work, but sometimes, one good joke with a colleague will make up for that. Oh, and the pay, there's always the pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not even 20 yet so this will be something to help build me up for a future occupation, I'm still in school so I work summers, Easter and Christmas. But even if I leave, I'd like to think that this is a place that I could always come back to.</span></div></div>",

I did this when I moved to Austin, Texas.  I had fairly good luck in the past working as a temp in other cities.  However, this time luck wasn't in my favor.  I was open to both temporary and temp-permanent positions.  At the time there wasn't a lot of permanent positions out there, and I ended up working a string of temporary jobs, most overly complicated (for a person coming in to work a week or two!), or just down right unpleasant!  The worst was in a printing press as a data entry clerk.  My desk was downstairs in the cellar.  This would have been okay, except that the printing machines were across the hall.  The smell of ink and amonia was very strong drifting across the hall into our UNVENTILATED area!  I had to sit there all day putting in people's subscription information while breathing toxic fumes and drinking coffee strong enough to stand a spoon in.  The first day I drove home light headed and with a migraine.  The second day I asked the other ladies if the fumes affected them and they didn't seem to notice the fumes at all.  They were totally used to it!  The second day I drove home with another migraine and feeling quite ill.  I debated on whether or not I should complete the job.  Since there was only one day left, I went ahead and went in, reluctantly!  I endured again, feeling very tortured, and ended again with a splitting headache.  The temp agency called me that evening and said the company would like me to come in for another day (or two), but I declined.  The place really did make me sick!  And now I don't think I would ever be willing to take a job in a printing press again.</span></div></div>",

I work in a Hotel in Queensland Australia - which gives me access to many different people and personalities. I am remembering a story one of these people told me about a taxi driver from heaven. I hope he is ok with me retelling it :). Actually - I know he is.<br>\r\nEddy and his girl friend Angie have loved New York City with a passion that rivals no other. The buildings, the people, the hustle and yes, the bustle is captivating to them both. So on this particular trip Eddy decided to make it just that little bit more memorable. \"I will propose in NYC\" he says - quite impressed with his own genius and wit. With this grand plan in mind he sets off with his task list and with Angie non the wiser.<br>\r\nThey leave OZ - the great downunder - and start on their epic journey. Once in NY there is so much to see and do and soon Eddy is distracted enough - that it comes close to the end of the trip before he realises he still has not popped the question. 'This is the night' he states silently. They are off to dinner at a very ritzy hotel and the time couldn't be more perfect. They hail a cab - as walking isn't as much fun and off they go.<br>\r\nDuring the ride Eddy is getting nervous. He's never done this before and it all has to be perfect. He continuously fiddles with the ring in his pocket.<br>\r\nLater, after a couple of cocktails and some good food - Eddy pops the question. Smooth and suave, very unlike himself. Angie says YES and Eddy reaches in his pocket for the ring. UH OH. The ring is GONE! Now he starts to panic but tries to hide it from Angie. Angie has known him too long and asks Eddy what he has done. With a smile on her face she urges Eddy to explain. He confesses that the ring, the beautiful ring is missing. They start to back track everywhere they have been and Angie remembers the taxi. But not the number or the driver. They contact the cab company but not all the drivers are back to the depot yet. Our hapless travellers are leaving for OZ in the morning so time is of the essence. The dispatcher promises to contact them if the ring is found.<br>\r\nLong story short - the driver of the cab ended up posting the ring back to Eddy and he was invited to their NYC wedding last year&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually I applied to this college to be with my boyfriend but right after senior prom he broke up with me.  My heart mourned for most of the summer as I just plugged away at life just getting by.  I really didn't do much that summer except slowly pack up my existance to go away to college.  I knew he was going to be there also, but I didn't know in what dorm so it came to a surprise that his dorm was across the street as mine.  I remeber one day coming back from class on a Friday, I saw him walking across the street from the parking lot with the girl he broke up with me for.  Needless to say, he ended up dropping out after getting her pregnant and now he as a teenage son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I started off as a business major and quickly learned that even know I could balance my checkbook most months, I couldn't understand the fundamentals of my accounting class.  Clue one that I shouldn't have been a business major.  By the end if my first year I was able to go to the bars (had a bar entry age of 18 then) and as soon as that happened I found new love....so I thought.  We spent the rest of the year together and the entire summer inbetween summer school and work.  In the fall I went back and he had already transferred before we met.  So I spent the next year traveling to visit him or hang with him when he came to visit me and the rest of his friends.  I wasn't going to class and I eventually failed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't tell my parents until about a week before I was sapposed to go back for the spring semester.  Actually my brother ended up telling them for me because I was too frightened to do it.  But by that point my brother had gotten me a job at the  jonior college and enrolled into classes.  We had found out what I needed to take in order to get back into my previous school and at that point I was determined.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fall I was back on campus and had changed my major to Graphic Design.  It was a joy to like going to class and a joy to be there again.  It was failing out that really kicked me into high gear that this was serious.  I have always been into art and did well in highschool and enjoyed a good craft project.  I graduated in the summer of 95 and only a 2 semesters behind if I was on the true 4 year program.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first job was in the advertising department of a national craft store chain but that only lasted 8 months when filing bankruptcy cost most of us our jobs.

I enjoy what I do and love the fact that I learn something new most every day. <br>\r\nThough some days it is quiet, I love the thrill of getting the project done fast and seeing it out and about a few days later.  </span></div></div>",

So as I scream in pain my sister wonders what I am doing.<br>\r\n \"Go get Mom, ice, anything!!\" Well she doesn't. <br>\r\n\"Why are you yelling at me?! MOM HEATHER'S YELLING AT ME!!\" and immediatly starts to cry being only 5-6 years old. <br>\r\n\"HEATHER MARGARET!! WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT YOUR SISTER?\" (You guessed it. She is the baby of the family and I am the oldest) Mom \"says\". <br>\r\n\"Mom, just get me some ice, PLEASE!\" I plead.<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to me in that tone, young lady!\" (Oh no she used the young lady card!)<br>\r\n\"Mom she burned me!\" I say.<br>\r\n\"Just becuase you burned yourself doesn't mean you have to blame her.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I don't care who did it just get some ice or something.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't boss me around\" <br>\r\nSo I had to get the ice myself and had to go to school with a burn on my face, go to practice and work in a hot kitchen at work.

There is a lot to learn about this job, and I no longer think it is not a \"real job!\"  It is more challenging than my 40 hour a week one back in Texas!<br>\r\nA day in the life of me consist of getting up around 7:30am, getting dressed to the shoes, getting my 2 year old daughter out of bed (she's usually my alarm clock) and making my way downstairs to cook breakfast for my family.  I typically go with something simple like porridge, which is oatmeal in America, or toast with jam or peanut butter.  On the weekends I will go for something more complicated like eggs.  <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/pthb.png\" alt=\"*Pthb*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Pthb\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\nAfter breakfast and seeing the fiance' off to work, I clean up the dishes and kitchen.<br>\r\nThen I check my email and log on to W.Com, check up on my forums and such.  <br>\r\nAfter that, I will usually get a load of laundry going and do a little tidying up.  The day is spent playing with my daughter...Ring Around the Rosie, spinning around in a chair, running around the house playing chase, playing The Sims, playing my keyboard and working with my music recording, cooking lunch, making snacks, and doing various other chores around the house as needed. <br>\r\nMy daugter has an afternoon nap, in which time I can usually be found soaking in a hot bubble bath with a glass of wine!  It is my only quiet time of the day and I value it deeply.<br>\r\nMy daughter is going through a phase where her naps are shorter and she wakes up cranky, so the first 30 minutes after she awakes are spent trying desperately to get her in a good mood again!<br>\r\nAround 5pm I do any tidying up that is left in preparation of my fiance's return home.  Sometimes I prepare a meal, sometimes he does, depending on what is involved (cooking skills are something I still need to improve upon).<br>\r\nAround 8pm we start the bedtime routine for my daughter, which involves putting her on the potty, reading books, singing songs and lots of kisses.  She's in bed by 9pm at the latest and by this time I am throughly exhausted.  I will generally talk to my fiance' for awhile and do my best to get into bed at a decent hour, so I can get up and do it all over again.<br>\r\nI do not have transportation, and if I did, our routine might change a bit to include needed shopping.  Also, being winter we are not visiting the playground, but are about to try a Mother-Toddler group on Mondays.<br>\r\nI have grown to enjoy this, despite my initial negative feelings about it.  I've seen a drastic improvement in my daughter's behavior as I've spent more time with her and she's by far more healthy than she's ever been.  I've lost weight from the increased activity and better eating habits and feel happier, healthier and more energized now.  I still have not perfected routines that would make things easier, or really got it all together, but I like the challenge of trying.  I now have new dreams whereas before my dreams lay dormant.</span></div></div>",

Basically, there you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would anyone take up such work? They have to be good at what they do. They have to know entertainment: performance, music, advertising, talent and development, music biz, publishing, all aspects of production, law, intellectual property rights and regulations, and what it feels like to be on stage and come off still a human being. They have to love creating something, designing and rendering it, making their marks in the industry traditions, scoring that deal of a lifetime, and most of all, the ferocious and fatal competition.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>First I am not a midwife, yet. But I have worked as an apprentice for more than 4 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA typical \"day\" begins somewhere between the hours of midnight and six am. It begins like this. \"Mamie? Holly called and she has been having contractions for three hours. They are now four to six minutes apart and getting stronger. She's having bloody show and can't talk through a contraction. I'll meet you at the birth center.\" I can tell that by this description that I need to leave ASAP. So I tell Amy, the midwife, that I am on my way and drag my sleepy body out of the bed. Quickly I pull on a set of scrubs and brush my hair back into a clip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry rolls over and mumbles the question, \"Got one cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I reply while mentally determining what activities the kids have for the next 24 hours and who will be available to chauffeur them. I thank God that my parents are often readily available to fill in the gaps. \"Dad will take care of the school route and getting (10-year old) Jamie to ball practice. Heather can fix \"Hamburger Helper\" for supper. What time do you get out of class\"? Now what day is it? I wonder. \"Do you work tomorrow\"? I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy husband is a paramedic and full-time college student. Between classes and swapping shifts with co-workers, I don't even try to keep up with all the schedule changes. I just ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get out at 9:30, and yes, tomorrow is Saturday. I work. I'll ask your dad to get Jamie to her game.\" I love this man! I plant a quick kiss on his forehead and rush out the door as he calls for me to be careful and call him when I get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birth center is two hours of mostly state highways and farm to market roads away. Traffic is minimal; but since I pass over two lakes and a few roadside ponds, fog is often present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crank up the radio to the local contemporary Christian station and sing along. I am somewhat anal about not breaking the rules, or at least about not wanting to get caught breaking the rules. So while the speed limit in most areas is 70/65 at night, I set the cruise on 70 to 73 and hope to squeak past any troopers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping an eye out for an open gas station since I once again didn't fill the van, I flick the lights on bright to watch for deer. Of course, if the furry four-legged creatures would read the signs and only cross at the posted crossing, I wouln't have to worry about blinding the on-coming traffic when I inevitably forget to dim the lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, I pull into the station for a quick fill up and a French vanilla cappuccino. That done; I am back on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I realize that the machine manufacturers probably think if they made cappuccino at the temp where you could actually drink it, then it would probably cool too quickly. But, I am of the opinion that if it was at a drinking temp, then I would be able to drink it quickly and might have to purchase more. Oooh, profit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pull up to the birth center, I accomplish four things almost simultaneously. First, I finish my cappuccino. Then I pop a stick of bubble gum flavored gum into my mouth to cover the coffee smell and any remaining \"morning breath.\" Yeah, my priorities are out of order; I'll take the time for a cappuccino, but not for brushing my teeth. \"Extra!\" to the rescue (of my clients.) Next, I make that call to my husband, and finally, switch the phone to silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the birth room, I survey the situation. Birth supplies ready? Mom, how close does she appear to be to delivery? Answers? Mom is not pushing. She and Amy are visiting between contractions. Whew! I can slow down and take a breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirth supplies are purchased by the client and in this case they are already out and ready for use. I glance around the room. Towels are warming on the heating pad? <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check2.png\" alt=\"*Check2*\" title=\"Check2\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Crock pot is simmering the herbal tea with wash clothes to be used for warm compresses during pushing? <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check4.png\" alt=\"*Check4*\" title=\"Check4\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Mom has something to drink? <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check3.png\" alt=\"*Check3*\" title=\"Check3\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Dad is fulfilling the role of support person? <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/check5.png\" alt=\"*Check5*\" title=\"Check5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*Bigsmile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Bigsmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick up the chart to see where we are at, when the next set of vitals are needed, if the mom has any conditions that I need to remind myself of, and if the parents have any special requests for their birth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat accomplished. It is time to listen to the baby. Baby is active as every movement sounds like a kick to the doppler speaker. Fetal heart tones are supposed to be between 120 and 160 beats per minute. They are, and I chart them, noting the time they were checked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of hospital birth has a whole perspective and set of terms that are different from a hospital planned birth. For instance, we SERVE; we serve CLIENTS; and we CATCH babies. Midwives offer a service. Our clients are our customers. Customers are informed and asked to participate in decision making. We see the mother as delivering the baby since she does the most work and we \"catch\" the baby. We are trained in preventative care and to recognize normal variations of pregnancy, labor, birth, newborn, and postpartum care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctors are AUTHORITY figures for which most people have been conditioned to obey without question. Doctors have PATIENTS. Most doctors see themselves as DELIVERING the baby.  Doctors are trained to look for problems and a lot of their ob rotation is spent in surgery. I am glad that they know how to do surgery as there are times when it is certainly necessary!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the idea. So I will jump down off my soapbox and back into the birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass, while we give supportive care to both the mother and other family members that may be present. We offer choices of activity and changes of position that may help the baby into a better position for delivery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMothers have the option to labor and/or deliver in water or on \"land.\" Water offers pain relief even while sometimes increasing the strength and effectiveness of contractions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a land birth, we place several chux pads beneath the mother. Further, mothers are offered many positions for delivery. Mom can recline against her spouse or pillows. She can lie on her side with her top foot resting against the midwife's shoulder. Dad can sit on the side of the bed and use his legs to provide an open seat for Mom, or he can use his strength to hold her upright while she squats into the contraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom can stand with one foot on the bed and one on the floor while Dad stands close by offering support and the midwife sits on the floor ready to catch. This position is often alternated to encourage a baby to turn its head to tuck and align itself better. A well tucked and aligned head presents the smallest diameter for pushing through a pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany times a mom will use more than one of these options during a delivery. First time moms especially change positions more frequently. It is just that until you've pushed before (without medication), you don't really know how to do it. So changing the position helps keep the baby moving down and out. Of course if baby is having no trouble moving down the pelvis, we leave well enough alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBirth accomplished. It's time to facilitate family bonding. We do this by encouraging the mother to breastfeed the baby. We also offer an herbal bath to mom and baby. Once latch on is obtained and mom and baby are comfortable. We leave the room to allow for privacy and bonding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two hours, we return every 15 to 30 minutes to assess both mom and baby and quickly leave if everything is normal. Sometime during the first and second hour, we return to perform a complete newborn exam and give mom postpartum instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce mom has eaten, been up to use the restroom and bathe, both mom and baby's vital signs are withing normal limits, and at least two hours have passed, we can release them to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the family leaves, it is time for clean up. We strip the bed and get the laundry started. We disinfect and clean up any spills, remake the bed, and take out the trash. After a final look over our charts, a birth summary is completed. Everything ready for the next birth; we can go home PROVIDED that it is not an appointment day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of midwives set aside one or two days a week for appointments. These are frequently scheduled full of appointments every half hour. Word to the wise, don't schedule a high-maintence client before lunch or quitting time, or you will never get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppointment days have can have prenatals, postpartums, and if you have an ultrasound machine - ultrasounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA typical prenatal goes like this. \"Amanda, hi, have you left us a sample\"? If she replies, \"Yes,\" then I reply, \"Ok, let me check that and then I will weigh you.\" That done; we go into the prenatal room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile observing Amanda and anyone accompanying her, I begin her physical assessment. I look for clues as to her physical and emotional well-being. I take her blood pressure, check the position of the baby, listen to fetal heart tones, and measure her fundal height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, is the baby moving\"? I inquire.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"And do you have any swelling\"?<br>\r\n\"No,\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"Your urine was clear, and your blood pressure is 106 over 74,\" I say. \"The baby's back is on your left side which is a good position for to start labor. The heart rate was 136.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you have any questions or concerns\"? I give her  opportunity to express them and discuss options available to her for comfort measures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddressing the mom's concerns with practical advice and encouragement is a big part of an appointment. Handouts are often given to reinforce education given during a prenatal or postpartum visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything looks good from our stand point. If something comes up that you have a question about, just give us a call or email.\" I end the appointment with this statement so that my client knows that I am concerned about her and available to her for supportive care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPostpartum check ups involve both the mom and baby. Both are assessed. Mom for her healing after the birth. Baby for growth and development. State required testing is completed. Everything is charted. Finally we visit and continue our care with education and encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat concludes the standard care aspect of midwifery. Outside of this, there can be advertising of services, continuing education of the midwife, training of personnel and apprentices, advocating with the public for the rights of birth choices and breastfeeding, reviewing of charts, devising ways to improve services, teaching nutrition childbirth classes, offering to doula hospital clients, consulting on breastfeeding issues, bookkeeping income for tax purposes, filing insurance claims, and fighting lawmakers and physician for the right to offer choice of care to families concerning birth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm actually a university student with various little jobs here and there. But the one I want to try and do something with is restoring fountain pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what a fountain pen is, right? Those things with the shiny metal bits poking out the ends which nobody uses anymore? They were the most common writing-instrument before the late 1940s and 50s when the ballpoint pen came on the scene and the world of pens let out a collective sigh and groan at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVintage fountain pens, anywhere from 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 100 (and over) years old - are highly collectible and various models are especially sought-after. The Waterman '52' from the 1910s, the Parker Duofold from the 1920s, the Parker Vacumatic from the 1930s, the Parker '51' from the 1940s and 50s and so on and so forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost collectors of fountain pens (of which I am one) prefer collecting and buying pens that actually...WORK. After all, if you collected radios or vintage cars or antique clocks, you'd want them to work, too, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where I come in (or I will, in a few years' time). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompetent fountain-pen restorers are few and far between. It's truly a niche-market. In the \"old days\", any company gladly repaired a fountain pen, either for free, or for a price. Unfortunately, such pen companies do not repair pens (even though they were MADE by that very company), if they are beyond a certain age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestoring a vintage fountain pen to working condition is both challenging and fun, easy and hard, relaxing and frustrating. Fountain pens are much like motor-cars - they have to run smoothly, they have to have a working fuel-delivery system and they must have an operational filling system and fuel-containment area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"wheels\" of a fountain pen is the nib. The nib must be smooth, level and free of kinks. It must have plenty of tipping-metal as well, to prevent wearing down of the nib-metal (think of tipping-metal as if they were car-tire threads. They perform the same function, more-or-less). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fuel-delivery system is the feed, a long plastic (or rubber) thing-a-ma-jig that transports ink from the fuel-tank - the ink-sac, to the nib. The feed is made up of little channels and gills and these must be cleaned and scrubbed so that old ink and other sediments may be removed. This is so that the ink will flow smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next major part is repairing the filling-system. This can include replacing rubber ink-sacs, fixing filling-mechanisms such as buttons, levers, slides, pistons, knobs...see? A fountain pen really can sound like a machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all the inner workings of the pen. Then comes repairing the 'bodywork' - that is - fixing clips, cap-bands, chips, dings, scrapes, cracks, cuts, engravings, brassing, rust - etc. A properly restored fountain pen should work for at least as long as it was previously designed to last for. And considering that some are nearly 100 (and some over 100) years old and still working - means that these things were built to last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've only just started on restoring fountain pens and my current project is a Waterman lever-filler from the 1940s. Yeah that's right, folks. Let's take a trip back to World War Two! By the time I'm done with this darling, it'll be running just as good as it did when it was first-used. It's fun and challenging, but the end result is worth it. </span></div></div>",

It was a proud moment for me the first day I attended classes in college September of 1956 after graduating from Modesto High School.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege graduation at Fresno State College that June 1960 was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I proudly accepted my Bachelor's Degree which prepared me for teaching English, Writing, History and Social Studies.  Those were my favorite high school courses so I thought it would be great to teach those subjects to high school and junior high students.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contract I signed with Ceres, California School District said that all of my classes but one would be eighth grade Creative Writing and one seventh grade math class.  I developed the curriculum for Creative Writing and during the year and my students produced some wonderful poems and essays.  I loved teaching the classes and watching the least capable among them become creative writers.  I still have some of their writings  which I read again recently.  To this day, I think the District should never have employed a math teacher who had not studied how to teach math.  While I did my best to teach my math students, I have always thought they were cheated by the District for requiring a non-math teacher to hold them hostage an hour a day.  The students deserved a teacher trained in the art of teaching math, not a teacher who knew her math very well but had no training in teaching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter teaching for several years, I changed vocations and became the Volunteer Director at the Idaho State School and Hospital for the intellectually disabled.  That was 1969 and I quickly fell in love with the accomplishments that I could cause by doing the statewide job I had accepted.  One goal was to teach people all over the state to stop using words like 'idiot, imbecile, moron, mongoloid and worse' names.  At that time, the words 'mentally retarded' was the most respectable term we wanted people to use.  At the same time, the job included recruiting and training ordinary people and students of all ages to visit the institutional home of over four hundred individuals and make personal contributions to their lives.  It didn't take long for me to fall in love with that job and the wonderful volunteers who gave of themselves to help individuals who just wanted a friend.  I worked with women who were community leaders to raise funds and build the All Faiths Chapel at the institution which today, years later, serves less than two hundred residents and patients, most of whom can't understand religion; but, I believe they know God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose experiences and others led me to accept the position of Development Director, a fund raiser, to raise money for hospitals and other nonprofit activities.  My years of fund development led to raising over six million dollars for my organizations.  I developed the Fund Development Program at Mercy Medical Center, Nampa, Idaho, by making speeches to all community groups in the area while designing and implementing a Direct Mail program for sending those 'infernal' letters asking for donations that every resident in America receives from charitable organizations.  It takes a heart and skill to write those letters in a way that leads thousands of people to write checks and give their money for the benefit of someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevelopment Directors like me, learn how to plan and implement fund raising events and activities that are so much fun that people give money to the charity.  The primary part of such events was the recruitment of community leaders and other talented and interested people to serve on the planning committee.  For the Annual Tennis Tournament which lasted more than ten years, I recruited five tennis players who served as the planning committee all of those years.  They included an insurance agent, an intensive care nurse, a school librarian, a cardiologist and a banker.  My job was to guide and serve them and 'pick up the pieces', the tasks that made their work successful.  I also created an annual Golf Tournament that still continues to be one of the best in the state.  For another hospital where I was Foundation Fund Development Director,  I created the Festival of Trees which raised twenty-eight thousand dollars the first year and over a hundred thousand its fifth year.  Again, the creation and serving of a community committee was the basis of the success.  An Annual Gin Rummy Tournament was a huge success at one medical center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFund Development Directors must find ways to develop long term donors.  With that focus, I met with individuals, wrote letters, promoted the charity through a newsletter, produced brochures and designed donor recognition methods.  Each day, I made personal or mailing contacts to donors and potential donors who were individuals, business leaders, ordinary individuals and a variety of organizations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResearching sources of major funding was always important in my work of raising money for charitable organizations.  Not only did I learn how to and successfully wrote grant proposals that were funded by Foundations, Corporations, state and federal government, but I developed training programs on the \"how to\" of fundraising and grant writing so that others could learn.  Even though they competed with me in fundraising and writing grant proposals, there was always money for all of us if we wrote quality grant requests.  I became called \"the Dean of Fundraising\" in Idaho during those years because I shared my knowledge and success with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an ordinary day in life as a Fund Development Director, I would meet with one or more staff members, meet with the Board of Directors or the Management Team, write 'thank you' letters, make telephone calls and keep appointments, edit and publish newsletters, write grant proposals to Foundations and Corporations or government sources, meet with volunteers to plan events, oversee office activities and supervise staff, while always focusing on progress and growth for creating new ways to raise money for the clients of the charitable organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, besides raising those six million dollars, I set into play hundreds of activities and recruited hundreds of volunteers and donors to continue the work after I left so I choose to take credit for the fundraising work that transpired for the benefit of the deserving clients of each organization even after I moved on and retired.  I am proud of every volunteer I recruited, every grant proposal I wrote, every dollar raised and every friend gained for the organizations and their clientele whom I served 1969 to 1999.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work was a challenge and I am blessed.</b></span></span></font><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Becoming a chef\u2026 now that\u2019s a great idea, and one that I can see a person wanting to pursue.  Becoming a restaurant manager in the family dining sector, however\u2026 well, you may want to hear a little bit about what it\u2019s like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong.  This is the absolute best job I can ever think of for myself, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world.  But it\u2019s not for the faint at heart, for sure.  I oftentimes laugh at guests who look at us as if we work in the restaurant industry because we were not qualified enough to work in any other vocation.  We don\u2019t do it for the money, I admit.  We do it for the challenge.  We are adrenaline junkies who have found a mainstream job to make us feel right.  My job is to ensure complete guest satisfaction and feed a family of five everything from pancakes to a steak dinner within eight minutes, ensure that all of the food ordered comes off the grill at the exact same instant, timed in a way that the server can get it out to the table as soon as it hits the heat lamp at the same time as I am tending to a guest who is waiting to pay, three more who need to be seated, and repairing a walk-in cooler that does not want to keep temperature.  Now, multiply that by 50 guests an hour for 12-14 hours and 6 more equipment breakdowns.  Here\u2019s my\u2026 \u201cA Day in the Life\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no typical day.  Of course, you walk into every day with a plan, which you often throw out the window before most normal people have had their first full cup of coffee.  At 4 a.m., I am ready to go, having had half a pot of coffee already, I drive to work with a plan, an agenda of things to accomplish that day.  There are community fundraisers begging for my attention, and more than my share of administrative duties to perform.  I have food orders to place for everything from fresh produce to ice cream to steaks and eggs.  Throw into that mix the incredible span of personalities employed by me: combine with love.  Now, Sally is always fighting with her boyfriend and needs to be talked down by someone before she is expected to be \u201con\u201d (the term we use for being in the public\u2026 we are always on stage).  Bart is usually late and works three jobs just to make ends meet.  Jerry is sick a lot, but there are rumors that it has to do with extra-curricular activities rather than his health.  Easily, one would say these folks should be let go.  However, good employees in this industry with only a fault or two are hard to come by.  You set up the roster with what you\u2019ve got and you fight the good fight, day in and day out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s 11 o\u2019clock.   Lunch hour is open me before I realize it.  My second cook has not come in to help cover the lunch hour.   He lives with his Mom, so I call her.  She assures me he left for work at the same time he always does (I find out later she hasn\u2019t seen him since the weekend before).  As I\u2019m on the phone, my cook comes to tell me that he can only keep one fryer lit.  Going into lunch on a Fish-Fry Friday\u2026 this is the worst time for this to happen.  Then again, Murphy\u2019s Law is not one for timing.  At the same time that I am working to light the fryer, the dishwasher tells me no one has pulled the fish from the freezer for the special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA customer has a complaint about bad service from a server.  I go to the dining room to find out if there\u2019s anything I can do to rectify the situation.  Winds up it\u2019s a good friend of mine.  I offer her a free meal the next time she comes in for the inconvenience of not getting her milk with her meal.  She agrees and leaves happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver for the produce company comes in with the order only to tell me that they ran low things and were not able to complete my order.  I quickly call the local grocery store and ask for the produce manager.  When he finds out who I am, he cuts me a wholesale-type deal on the purchase and I send an employee to pick up what we need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe char broiler catches on fire during lunch and I put it out, instructing the cook to replace all of the burnt items he tried to make on the char broiler on the flat grill until I can get the mess cleaned up.  Praise salt and all of its powers in putting out fires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after lunch, the dish machine springs a leak.  We\u2019re washing dishes by hand.  Not that much slower, but air drying is not the quickest.  Thankfully, lunch is coming to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond shift is ready to start.  A server calls in.  A big snow storm is coming.  Tourists are flocking in for snowmobiling.  The lights go out in the dining room\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a day in my life, and I love it!  Sorry if some of you have to sit in an office all day.  I could never do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hours are varied and it has its ups and downs, but there is no other job I could possibly want right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a Stay at Home Mom is nothing like the stereotype of a someone watching soap operas all day while the hubby is at work. As a Stay at Home Mom I focus on balancing between having a clean house, a happy family and making sure to devote at least a little time to my own hobbies or interest, i.e. writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy husband and I live on a farm that we caretake he is actually a Work at Home Dad in the oddest sense. He takes care of the farm during the day, doing landscaping, caring for animals and doing any maintenace that needs to be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving both parents stay home is quite an odd feeling. We are very close and do quite a lot together, even the grocery shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy days consist of getting up and taking care of our three dogs and then doing some housework or writing until my daughter wakes. My little girl loves to sleep in, which is useful to me as that hour in the morning before anyone else wakes is one of the most peaceful hours of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my little girl wakes up, the entire house is up. The farm animals, donkeys, goats, horse and chickens ensure that the air is filled with a wonderful barn yard symphony as my husband trudges up to feed them. On occasion I let my husband sleep in while I deal with the farm animals before our daughter is up for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast my daughter and I usually watch Sesame Street together or head out for a morning play date at a friends house or the storytime at the library. I like to think of the mornings as the time that I focus on learning for her. If we stay home we read tons of books and point at different objects throughout the house. I try to teach her at least one new item each day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn early afternoon we make lunch and eat together in our breakfast nook. She usually uses this opportunity to tell me what each item on her plate is about six times before she even takes a  bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaptime starts about 2 or 2:30 and I spend it a variety of ways: sometimes I write, sometimes I read, and sometimes I do chores around the house. My husband usually comes in from his work around the farm to eat his lunch about the time that Elle goes down for her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am lucky that naptime still lasts a couple hours so I can get a variety of things done. After naptime is over, we sometimes go for a walk around the farm if we did not do so in the morning and if it is not too cold as it often is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we get back home, I head in to make dinner while my husband hangs out with Elle in the living room. Sometimes they watch a cartoon together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner we all spend time in the living room together, sometimes reading, talking or watching television until bathtime. My daughter loves bathtime so it is quite an ordeal. During this time my husband heads outside to give the farm animals dinner and close up the chickens for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen bathtime is over we read books until bedtime. And when it's her bedtime, which is rather late at 10 p.m., my husband and I spend time together. We're late night people so we don't usually get to bed until about midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I made good money and had a good life, but there must be more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started talking with my late friend's widow, whom I had known for 25 years.  It turns out we didn't really know each other at all.  The relationship was between Chris and me.  Our wives never really played a role in our friendship.  We found out we had common interests and goals.  Travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time we decided to commit to each other and see the world.  My background in business, with some teaching experience, combined with her 30 years as an elementary teacher must have some value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opportunity landed in our lap.  We had a chance to go to China - I would teach business and she would teach English. Both of us went to work at the same school in northern China.  We sold everything we had and reduced our lives to two suitcases each.  What freedom we felt.  All past encumbrances were gone.  We took our suitcases and moved to China.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew my topics inside and out, from my years of experience.  She was able to transfer her elementary teaching into adult education with no difficulty.  Now we were both teachers.  Teaching didn't consume near as much time as business and we found that we had lots of time and money to travel and see this part of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur workload increased considerably when the SARS epidemic hit.  We had no fear of the disease and felt it was overblown, but other foreign teachers got scared and escaped home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had planned  to stay in China for up to five years, but at the end of the first year, I was offered another opportunity in the Middle East.  We were hesitant to leave China so soon, but we felt we had to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have been in the Middle East for almost six years now.  Teaching continues to be easy compared to working in business.  We have lots of money and time off.  So we get to see the world - Egypt, Keyna, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, France, Holland, Cyprus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeaching itself is rewarding.

I'm one of those people who feel that the study of history is paramount to our understanding of the present and, even, the future.  Humans are predictable creatures as a species and, as such, we continue to make the same decisions, whether for good or ill.  I wanted to tell people the story of our existence--or, at least, the portion of that existence in which America has taken part--and I wanted to make people love history as much as I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the people who control the purse strings seem to believe that math and science are more important than the humanities and social sciences.  As such, within the world of academia, for every one job there must be at least eighty applicants.  And cronyism, though most of us know the consequences of that particular sin in our nation's history, continues to run rampant within our world.  But I wasn't worried; not really.  I was good.

Suddenly, my creative writing skills became a hindrance instead of my calling card because that \"wasn't how historians wrote\".  All of my passions, my courses of study until then (mostly the power of public memory in creating history, especially when the public memory is, in fact, false), were deemed to be too \"loaded\" and not \"disinterested\".  My habits of looking at history from the perspective of a political scientist (my minor) or a philosopher (my not-quite-second-major), or ESPECIALLY an anthropologist (apparently it's OK to be ethnocentric in History) became habits that I needed to rid myself of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEssentially, my passion and my differences alienated me from my chosen field.  I couldn't quote every book I'd ever read, either, even though I was encouraged to practically skim each book I was assigned.  Literally, it became about parsing details and rote memorization, which were the parts of history I'd HATED in high school.  Mostly, it was attempting to make me into something I wasn't simply because what I was was apparently NOT a historian.  I went into the humanities to avoid that very sense of narrowness, but apparently it exists everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I realized I didn't want to do it anymore when someone in my class said: \"I am a historian, not a writer\" and the professor agreed with him.  When it became apparent that historians study history in order to promote themselves amongst themselves, I decided that I couldn't do it anymore.  I wanted to be a historian in order to teach people to love it, to share something that I dearly loved, and came to realize that that's not what historians do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now I'm a former historian-in-training. Unfortunately, things don't always work out the way you planned.  So I've changed my dream to reflect what I'm good at: writing.  Luckily, I've got y'all to help me out.</span></div></div>",

It could mean all sorts of things. Well, in my case, I produced ideas for new infant bedding sets (comforter, hamper, sheet, dust ruffle, lamps, mobiles &amp; such). If you're still not sure what I mean, take a look at BabiesRUs online. Check out the section for bedding sets and you'll see a little of what I was dealing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was the lucky person who got to come up with ideas for new sets, illustrate/draw/digitize layouts, pick out fabrics, create patterns, accessories and other such things. I've always enjoyed drawing little critters and this job allowed me to do that day in and day out. I worked there for about five months, trying to learn all I could from my co-worker and boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI worked mostly in a Mac OS environment with a huge Wacom Tablet in Adobe Illustrator CS3. Honestly, that was the best work environment I've been able to utilize thus far in my career. I did lots of internet and market research - some days I'd end up at BabiesRUs or somewhere comparable to see what was out there and get ideas. My boss and I would go to Walmart and Target to find new ideas too. From the moment I got there in the mornings to the time I would walk out, I was able to be creative and it really stretched me and allowed me to learn something new every day. I had to think about \"new\" ways of doing what'd already been done and got to press the limits of materials and construction. I mean, there are millions of ways to make a teddy bear set or a princess group and I got to present some solutions to those problems each day. I went in there only knowing how to draw and use the computer programs - the rest I had to pick up as I went along. And that was interesting in and of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat helped me get hired was my drawing ability and my graphic design background, and of course, my winning personality <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> I have a BS in Visual Arts (Graphic Design focus, creative writing minor) and four years in the large format graphic design industry under my belt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b><span class=\"cgreen\">The job I had before becoming a Product Development Associate was in a large format printing shop as a graphic designer, production associate, account manager. (We'll call this Job2) Job2 was, and still is a small family owned shop and so, with most small operations, I had to flatten my hair with many hats.<br>\r\nWe worked mostly with gaming clients - casino stuff. Meaning, we had to meet strict deadlines, be organized and professional. <br>\r\nThe work horse at Job2's shop was a large format flat bed UV printer. That thing weighed more than four elephants, I'm sure, but it only took one little guy to run it. With that machine we were able to print directly to substrates (media - paper, banner material, coroplast, and other such materials). When I first got to Job2, it was surprising to me to see how it was all done. ((Because before I got hired on there, I worked in an even smaller shop, Job1, but we had to print on vinyl and then apply that to substrates - that method is much more labor intensive and there's lots of room for error - more on this other shop later.))<br>\r\nI never ran the UV machine, since one mistake could ruin a head that cost upwards of three thousand dollars, though I ran nearly every other machine we had in the shop at least once, from the large format solvent printer we used to print the banners and vehicle wraps to the small format Xerox 5252. When I was at Job2, I was the only person who could/would run the sewing machine. (We hemmed our banners with a sewing machine.) I cut things out of poster material, coroplast, foam core, sentra, gator board, banner material and other such medias. I got to use the ban saw, the button press, the big cutter machine (wish I could remember what that thing was called.) and whatever else they'd let me do. I\u2019ve always enjoyed learning new things.<br>\r\nBeing one of two graphic designers/account managers on site, I had to put in a lot of time on the phone with clients.  The two of us split the client list, so when the fat lady sang, I was responsible for approximately twenty clients at any given time. Working closely with so many people at the same time helped me better develop my time management, attention to detail and other such important skills. With so few workers, I had to take every project from beginning to end and make sure it got shipped out in a timely manner. Needless to say, I had notes plastered everywhere to help me keep up with the time-sensitive things.<br>\r\nI did some graphic design, but most of it was cookie-cutter kind of stuff and most of the clients had strict regulations the design had to adhere to. So, I developed my listening skills as well as my ability to follow directions closely. I worked in Adobe Photoshop every day and often did quick layouts in Illustrator. Sometimes I used InDesign, but had little use of that program for what I needed to accomplish. Most of the artwork came from design groups via FTP or email. I was responsible for making the artwork \"print ready\" and for \"ripping\" it at the corresponding printing station. That part wasn't too hard to learn. The software is annoying sometimes, but the basics are pretty much self-explanatory.<br>\r\nWhen I first arrived at Job2, I was a little intimidated, however that feeling faded quickly as I realized that although there was lots to get accomplished during the day and lots of varying tasks to handle, I was capable. I was allowed to work independently and take responsibility and ownership of jobs. Sometimes that bit me in the behind (I have always had a hard time telling someone that I can\u2019t do something for them.), but most of the time it worked out to everyone's advantage. <br>\r\nUnfortunately, not every large format print shop provides a good working environment. So be selective if you can. Before I worked at Job2, I worked in an even smaller shop I\u2019ll call Job1. Job1 was a tough working environment because for all rights and purposes I was the only person in the shop most of the time, as my co-worker was an absentee.  I was fresh out of college, no real experience with that kind of customer service or with any of the printing/laminating machines I had to run. Mostly, after about two months, my co-worker started being out more and more often, taking several extended lunch periods and such. That left me in the shop by myself. I picked up as much as I could from him while he was around (he was a good instructor and very smart), and for things he didn\u2019t teach me, I\u2019d either figure it out myself or call someone about it. So after about three months I was a one-girl-show around there. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but I learned a great deal about customer service and about people in general while I was there. And I was glad to leave when I did. <br>\r\nSo, if I could give a green designer a pointer or two: Be selective about where you start out because more than likely if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll end up in that kind of design environment over and over. Secondly, learn all you can from the instructors at school. Use the lab computers and software as much as possible, look up tutorials and do them en-masse, and reach for the stars.<br>\r\nAnd if anyone knows of a great work environment that needs another creative, let me know <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll make a quick and easy version at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started out doing fast food chains during High School and after leaving High School took a year off.<br>\r\nI went back to college and unfortunately just partied and had a blast, so instead of wasting my time I went back to working at some retail chains, anyways.<br>\r\nI decided to go back to school to be an auto mechanic due to enjoying tinkering on import cars. After my second quarter going to school I got offered a job as a Level 1 Diesel Technician at a local Diesel Repair Shop. I got paid a percentage of the work I did. (21 at the time of getting the job)<br>\r\n    I was trained for 90 days, during that time I basically learned everything I needed to know. I caught on quickly and was able to keep the job after the 90 day probation period. I was making more money than I ever thought was possible. It went well for a while until I was fired for something out of my control. I had to find another job at a smaller and less known establishment. I was paid more percentage wise but I did less work. I ended up having to work 16 hrs a day to try and make what I made at the other shop. Things were still going well, I had purchased a home and a few other toys to enjoy. Unfortunately though in the winter our workload goes down and in February I had to quit my job due to making less than 100 dollars a week and working 80+ hours. My body was worn and I was completely exhausted from the ordeals.<br>\r\nI got my job back at the original place I worked and worked there for three months before I had an emotional breakdown due to my house septic tank flooding and ruining my house. Side note : Septic tanks are considered maintenance issue and therefore insurance does not help. Since I spent all my savings during the months I didn't have a job and the winter slow months I had nothing left. I lost my house and quit my job. It ruined my relationship with my girlfriend and just overall it was a low point in my life.<br>\r\n   I decided to go back to school and pursue a business career but another year later decided I wanted to make money again so I took a job at a major dealership working on the leased vehicles. Money was good but the work was again long and tiring. After working there for almost a year I started blacking out and getting major migraines working in the conditions. I unfortunately got laid off and currently went back to school yet again to do what I wanted to do all along Network Security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Summary:<br>\r\nDiesel Technician (5 yrs total experience)<br>\r\nJob Conditions: <br>\r\n Physical<br>\r\n Long Hours (not always but typical)<br>\r\n Decent Pay but once tools and ruined clothing/vehicle upholstery is considered its not as much as first realized<br>\r\n Not a lot of room for improvement (manager might be the highest, typically any higher and a degree or a lot of experience is required)<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMy Suggestions and outlook of the future of Diesel Technicians<br>\r\nSuggestions :<br>\r\nDo not get into this field unless its your passion and you truly enjoy it. If you have doubts and not certain get a part-time job at a local oil change job. Once you get into purchasing the tools and lifestyle it becomes difficult to walk away at least for me it was.<br>\r\nGO TO SCHOOL, if you decide this is for you, go to school get a degree and perhaps go into engineering or parts or go into turning wenches but with more knowledge and better opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuture: In my relative short time in the field I found that more kids were being hired (such as I was) with little knowledge and trained. Turn Over was low once you make it through the probation period. I have a feeling that the smaller jobs are going to be done by uneducated workers while the only way to continue making any real amount of money would be to go to school and possibly go into some research and development phase.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But there's no escaping it. I did. After various attempts at Journalism and Media Studies degrees, I finally settled on pursuing a Digital Film Production degree, and this got me the balance I was searching for between the thing I love to do; write, and the thing I aim to do; make money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to be a film producer was one of the better decisions I've made in my life. It may just be <i>the only</i> right decision I've made. Making films meant I was able to indulge in my passion, traveling. Sri Lanka, Thailand, Jamaica, Turkey and the United States; I lived some unbelievable experiences in those countries that deserve to be ink on paper. I was lucky to say the least. I was consistently given grants, either from my university or media companies, to make films that I personally did not think were that great. To be honest, I didn't like filming that much. I was never a huge film fan, I hate the practical aspect of the job, such as camera settings and where to place the lighting and the rest of the technical mumbo-jumbo. I just wanted to travel, to experience things and live my life so that I have something to write about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that I am quite introverted and the camera was a great thing to hide behind. I felt more brave, I felt protected by that clunky machine and it helped me slowly grow into a curiously aggressive woman. I saw war and poverty ravaging the people I felt deserved it the least. I discovered that the people who have the least give the most. I understood the innocence and naivety of children to everything surrounding them, and that whether you're in an upscale neighborhood in London or the slums in India, children play, fight and laugh the same. I also experienced the other end of the spectrum: I saw how people use others when they sense weakness, as if we were in a jungle, not conscious, cognizant human beings. My lens helped me grow the courage to stand up for others and for myself. Anyone I captured with my camera lens became part of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all my travels, which didn't get me much in terms of film, I went back home and worked as a production assistant for short films. I would scout for locations, edit scripts, buy props, obtain the proper filming licenses, arrange catering for shoots, cast actors, schedule filming days, budget, etc. Not all of it was fun, but I did get to drive around the country a lot with my production manager. He was a large man, and I was intimidated by him from day one, even though a smile never left his face. During my first days on the job he payed a lot of attention to me, guiding me a lot and pushing me to be more curious about all aspects of the job. We quickly became friends. We laughed at the bad actors together, complained about the tyrannical directors, fussed about the budget and our shopping trips for film props quickly turned into lunch dates and dinner dates. Today we are engaged to be married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy experience as a Film Producer Assistant is probably different than one who is passionate about his job. For me, like many of you, I just want to write. Whether I am good at it or not, it's the only thing that feels natural to me, and I feel confident doing it. This job was just a gateway to writing material, and I know no other way of expressing myself.</span></div></div>",

Good grief was that class boring when we first did the Iliad.<br>\r\n11:00- HumCore until 11:50.

The trek is across the park, which must make it at least a quarter mile, uphill, and up many flights of stairs.  This ends at 12:50, so I have just enough time to get back to my dorm, catch my breath, and re-group, for HumCore Seminar!<br>\r\n2:00- I get ready to head out again, for Humanities Seminar, which is at 2:30.  <br>\r\n2:30-I'm in seminar, and it's actually quite helpful for understanding the material that the prof presents to us in discussion.  This goes until 3:30-ish, by which time I'm starving.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, by the time I get back, it'll be 4 pm, which means the dining hall is CLOSED to prep for dinner, which doesn't start until 4:30.<br>\r\nSuch is my crazy Monday.

We take for granted the ability that we have to shape the next generation. We can help to create astronauts, presidents, lawyers, other stay at home parents and spouses, or any other title you can throw out there. We help to shape them, mold them, create in them the person they choose to be in this life. We should be called miracle workers for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy kids are not astronauts, presidents, or lawyers, but they are good citizens of our country. They are great young men and my husband is a faithful and giving man. They can be born who they want to be, but most of the time it takes us slowly coaxing them over time to be that \"somebody\" they want to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe change the world a child at a time. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> I have battled career choices since high school and I never did go to college. I wanted a year off to just work and experience the work voice. I started with waitressing for a couple of years and I really liked it. My best experience was fine dining. I loved lighting the candles and making salads in front of couples from scratch. Our specialty drinks were also made at the table. We had carts to flamb\u00e9 bourbon , and speciality coffees. It was always a treat to hear about the reason for the special dinner. Anniversary stories, birthdays, a new expecting mother, and the list goes on. I have heard so many wonderful stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that I went to Hostess of a Hotel Company in the west. Although I thought I would like it, I found it too behind the scenes. I enjoy being with the people more. So I sent a resume to Lake Louise to work in a resort. I got the job but I chickened out and didn't want to leave home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that I entertained the thought of Retail. I started as a stock girl in a shoe store and over a course of two years I became manager. I managed the store for two years and was approached to be trained in Merchandising in head office. I was so excited I couldn't tell you how much. My problem was I had my son that year and I became ill shortly after, then my son became ill and I never did go back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a mother and caregiver is a full time job. It is hard and stressful and tiring, but the rewards are in the heart and that counts for so much. <br>\r\nAlthough I would never give up my now new calling in life, my other choice would be merchandising. I love putting things together and my motto has always been, \"It isn't about the product but it is all about the presentation.\"<br>\r\nI say that also for gifts. \"It doesn't matter about what is in the box but how you present it.'<br>\r\nI tend to go over board with deco's on the gifts and I always write a special note for each one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the age of 22 I was in college working on a 4 year degree, I had already completed a 2 year Associates Degree in Business Administration.  We were shocked with the news, my girlfriend was pregnant.  We were young, unmarried and both still going to school.  We chose to marry, have the child and she would continue with school.  When my wife completed school, she'd then work and I'd finish my bachelor's degree. At this time I was working two jobs, one as a storeroom clerk and weekends as warehouse stocker/order filler.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs life often does, I got spun in circles, after completing school my wife decided to file for divorce.  So much for her working while I finished school.  Now it was paying child support, living with a friend and working two jobs.  Fortunately the warehouse job turned into a full time receiving clerk position with benefits.  This then turned into a department manager's job in sporting goods.  I stayed in retail management for 3 years then took an 8 to 5 Monday to Friday sales position in Restaurant/hotel equipment, which lasted for 5 years.  The sales experience lead to another sales position in the technology sector; selling design software &amp; services to Architects, Engineer's and General Contractor's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow my current position, each day begins with an hour commute to our downtown office.  Arriving at my desk first up is reviewing current quotes, upcoming software maintenance renewals and top prospects.  Top prospects are reviewed in a web portal; current construction projects, who are their design partners, and key staff leading these projects.  Once I know who they are, who they work with and what they are working on now comes the internal meetings with technical staff; how to we leverage our software/services portfolio to create a compelling presentation.  Calls/emails are sent to arrange meetings.  At a team we'll hammer out which features in the design software we'll cover and what services to recommend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the days scheduled calls and meetings are completed I'll pull up the recommended training and professional development.  Which ranges from web classes on new benefits included with software maintenance to how to create a business process audit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach day is similar, schedule meetings, visit customers, create or follow up on quotes.  There are two other business providing the same products/services, it is very competitive with shrinking margins. As a sales role there is tremendous pressure to keep customers, close business and find new business.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering not finishing my 4 year degree I feel fortunate.  There is the pressure, reparative nature of the job and fluctuating income so what are the other options?</span></div></div>",

Well since I have been doing that since high school and know the ins and outs and up side downs and right side ups OH and the main and most prevalent attribute (loneliness) I think it's about time for a change.  Most recently I have been working for a food chain that I hear is about to go under.  Bottom up!  So I wonder what to do.  Change the type of work or run around filling apps for the same thing.  The same thing; cleaning!  So now I wait  at the door of the supermarket for them to exit and the manager lock me in - for ten hours!  Rotary buff the entire store and I'm done in six hours.  Then I get to sleep for four or climb the wall to the department store and chat with my co-worker which is forbidden hehe what do they expect?  So I sleep on the check out most times.  Time goes by so slow because it is really not the best place to sleep.  Raiding the dairy cooler is always a blast but it's a risk too or against the rules.  When they close and it is coming soon I think I will drive a truck.
