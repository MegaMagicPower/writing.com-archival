After all, not a day went by (that the poor kid had the money) that Naruto wasn't sitting in 'his' stool at Ichiraku Ramen, eating his own weight in noodles....that never seemed to go anywhere. Seriously, the kid wasn't burning enough calories, he never gained weight, and he was - by every medical standard - a shrimp. Short and skinny for his age, with clothing purchased with 'growing room' out of his small orphan stipend regularly billowing off of his arms and legs. It wasn't until some time after his graduation that anyone had even the slightest inkling what was going on, or why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, anyone except Kyuubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the seal in Naruto's navel, rested an entire constructed dimension. Built outside of space and time by Naruto's father, an arguable genius of the sealing arts, it housed the dreaded Kyuubi no Yoko, the Nine-Tailed demon fox, who's tails caused tsunamis, who's steps caused earthquakes. Who, with a casual shoulder-check, might send the Hokage Monument crumbling into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so much anymore; for the fox had been brought low near a hundred years past, his outward majesty reduced to the frail, tiny vessels in which he was sealed. First a woman, then a girl, and finally a baby. That tiny cage was the last straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, carefully meditating to float on a veritable <i>ocean</i> of ramen, which he had collected through years and years of transporting food and nutrient's from his host's stomach, the Kyuubi stretched forth his own energies, snaking them carefully - so very carefully - past the seal. He'd worked out long ago that the seals were meant to keep his energy within the bodies of his hosts, and to prevent him from doing them harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, his plans for Naruto were not exactly conventional, but you couldn't call it 'harm'. More of a boost, really. And he'd felt too cramped in tiny human bodies for far too long. He wanted room to spread his energy. He wanted the world to see, if not him, something to properly show his majesty once more. The red-tinged soup on which he sat started to swirl, carried outward as his chakra, for the first time, was drawn by his host's anger and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi grinned, showing far too many teeth, and <i>pushed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to renovate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi-sensei! Naruto remembered, they were in a fight on the bridge, and Sasuke, Sasuke! -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, calm down. Fight's over, Naruto. Everyone's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt his teacher's hand grip his shoulder, and slowly relaxed. His eyes stung, and he couldn't help sniffling a bit. Shrugging off his teacher's hand, Naruto scrambled to his feet and stumbled his way over to a pile of slowly-melting ice. Frantic, he looked around for the body. Where was Sasuke's body?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Dobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto froze, turning slowly with wide eyes, to see his...rival? Friend?....whatever, too confusing. <i>Sasuke</i> was there, and he was <i>alive</i>! The pale, dark-haired boy shot Naruto an almost friendly smirk. Naruto felt something bubbling up inside; he just couldn't hold it in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YATTA!\" He cheered, and rushed over to his team-mate, lifting him up in the air and spinning him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up, seeing the friend in his arms blushing and glaring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down, moron!\" Sasuke snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing a bit, embarrassed, Naruto lowered Sasuke down to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens froze. Sasuke's head only made it up to Naruto's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah, I was wondering when you'd notice. I thought the breeze would do it.\" Kakashi muttered as he strolled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, and looked down. Sure enough, there was a large gap between his jacket and his pants, and his pants were definitely too short. He was also barefoot, though the rough ground didn't seem to be hurting him. Naruto looked up (a little) at his teacher, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sensei? Why am I bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shrugged, though if Naruto didn't know any better he'd think his teacher looked a bit worried.  At this point, a grimy but serious-looking Sakura joined up with the group, looking Naruto up and down with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That started when you...when you let out that red chakra of yours.\" Kakashi answered. Naruto's two younger team-mates nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sort of...puffed up,\" Sakura tried, gesturing with her hands. \"It was really strange. You started punching those ice mirrors, and they just exploded! After the fight, you passed out, but didn't...un-puff? Is that a word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kakashi said calmly. \"No it is not. But that sums it up. The important thing is that we head back to the village as fast as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned. \"Okay...but why? I mean, I don't really <i>mind</i> being a little bigger, so why don't we go back to Tazuna's and re<b>uuuuuuuuurp</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slapped his hands over his mouth, blushing furiously. For some weird reason, he tasted ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why.\" Kakashi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his mouth to get a better explanation, but suddenly he <b>felt</b> something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started as a feeling of almost painful fullness in his gut, and it <i>pushed</i> out. He could feel a burning energy pumping its way from his middle out to the tips of his fingers and toes. He shivered, and felt a pounding in his veins like his heart was forcing blood into every nook and cranny of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what's going on?\" He rasped, clutching his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to describe it later.\" Kakashi said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thump....Thump....Thump....Thump....</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt a strange, tight sensation in his skin; he wriggled a bit to try and make it go away. His muscles felt cramped; there was a strange soreness in his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it later, Naruto would describe that final, powerful pressure as if you were drinking from a hose and some jerk opened it up from window-garden to fire-hydrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto heard and felt his body rumble strangely as his team-mates seemed to <i>shrink</i>. His black undershirt stretched as it pulled up along his stomach, leaving his middle completely exposed. His jacket crept up his arms and opened at the front, his pant-legs pulled tight against his calves, and he felt the ground sliding under the soles of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few short moments, Naruto found himself looking Kakashi in the eye.<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room was deadly silent as everyone stared at Naruto...even Naruto was staring at himself, shakily raising his arms up and turning his hands back and forth, blinking slowly. It felt so...weird, so alien! He still felt like himself, mostly but there was an increased heft to his form, a weight that hadn't existed just a few seconds prior. It made him feel like a stranger in his own skin. He carefully took up a bit of said skin in his fingers and pinched, hard. \"Yeowch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice, still boyish and immature but with an added volume and slightly more depth due to his expanded chest, broke the spell that was in the room. Kakashi sighed and, feigning a casual attitude, calmly announced, \"Well that was certainly strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STRANGE?!\" Sakura shouted, turning to face her sensei. \"A herd of stray cats following you home is strange, this is downright unnatural! I know a thing or two about anatomy, sensei, and I know people don't just grow like that for no reason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Sakura.\" Kakashi said, his eye glancing over to Naruto and Sasuke; Naruto was still running his hands over his exposed body, touching his flat stomach before bending over and rubbing his shins....tearing open the back of his pants in the process. He swiftly stood back up, blushing again, his bigger hands covering the prominent rip, hiding his boxers from view. Sasuke smirked, earning him a glare from the now much taller genin. \"Panicking isn't going to help anyone. As I said earlier we should make our way back to the village as soon as possible. Before we go, Naruto, I need to ask you a few questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shuffled his way over to Kakashi, looking a bit sullen as his hands were still covering his backside. \"W-What is it Kakashi-sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his mouth to respond but quickly closed it again, his teeth clicking together audibly as he gritted them slightly, thinking it over. How DID he feel? He still hadn't really processed what had just happened! Not to mention the tightness of his clothes was starting to irritate him. It was like he had decided to dress himself up in his little kid clothes, hardly a dignified look for a proud ninja. On the other hand...he didn't feel sick, he didn't feel tired, hell, he didn't even feel worn out! It was like he hadn't just been in a grueling life or death fight not half an hour ago. He had been able to lift Sasuke up off his feet by barely trying, as well. He had always considered himself strong but now he felt STRONG, strong enough to break free of ropes if Kakashi tried tying him up again like during the bell test. It was hard to articulate all this so Naruto settled on taking a deep breath and grinning. \"I feel...pretty great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke and Sakura both shared a look that clearly read \"Seriously?\". Typical Naruto, even adult sized he was still a brain dead goober. Yet it was also oddly reassuring to both kids. Naruto was, after all TYPICAL Naruto. Huge or not, he was himself. Kakashi couldn't contain a little smile as he heard this. \"Well, that's good to hear at least. No body pain, no head pain, no abnormalities as far as you can tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched his exposed stomach and rubbed the back of his head, tongue out, thinking. \"Mmmmm, nope! Nothing like that! So since I'm not sick, how about we actually say a proper farewell to Tazuna and Inari and everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi's smile disappeared at that notion. \"I really don't think that's wise Naruto. You may feel fine now but this still isn't a normal occurrence. We need to get you back home and have you looked over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww come on Kakashi-sensei!\" Naruto whined, frowning at his teacher. \"What's the harm in spending a few extra minutes here? It's not like I'm going to explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did puff up before...\" Sakura murmured, looking Naruto up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sakura, I thought you'd be on my side!\" Naruto said, turning and looking down at his pink haired teammate. \"You want to say good bye to everyone, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...o-of course I do!\" Sakura stuttered, feeling a bit...intimidated by the much larger Naruto in front of her. \"But Kakashi-sensei is right, you need to get examined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Sasuke?\" Naruto quickly asked, turning his intensity on his other teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, do what you want, idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Sasuke agrees with me!\" Naruto said, a vein popping on his forehead. He reached over and wrapped his arm around Sasuke's head, yanking him to his side, pressing the shorter male's face against Naruto's exposed stomach, squeezing him in a merciless headlock. \"So it's two against two! What do you say sensei? Willing to change your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke struggled mightily but couldn't break the death grip Naruto had on him. Sure Naruto had been strong at kid sized but was getting a bit taller really able to make him THIS much stronger? Kakashi felt a bit of a chill as he realized Naruto might have gotten physically strong enough to be a bit of a...problem. \"Alright Naruto, we can say good bye. But just for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!\" Naruto cheered, jumping in the air, letting Sasuke go at the same time, knocking him to the ground. \"The Great Naruto Uzumaki wins again! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD ON A SECOND NARUTO!\" Sakura yelled, her eyes going white as she held up a clenched fist. \"You can't just knock Sasuke to the ground like he's some trash and expect to get away with it! I'm going to pound you into the ground!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura charged and punched Naruto square in the stomach, the taller ninja gasping and bending over slightly, holding his midsection. \"Aaaaaaah Sakuraaaaaaaa why'd you do that? I think I'm going to throw up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better not, or I'll really give you a beating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two please just shut up already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sasuke, are you okay? That idiot didn't hurt you did he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi crossed his arms and watched all this in silence. Naruto was already treated rather poorly by the villagers; how exactly were they going to treat him now? At least Sasuke and Sakura had gotten over their shock and were treating him like normal...He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, \"If you three want to get home sometime before dark, we should probably think about heading out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until Naruto makes himself decent!\" Sakura quickly spoke up. \"He can't go around looking like...that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tugged at his jacket and shirt, looking a little put out. \"Is it really that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura has a point. It's shocking enough that you're a twelve year old the size of an adult, the least we can do is make you more...presentable.\" Kakashi agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any spare clothes I can borrow sensei?\" Naruto asked, an image of himself dressed up like Kakashi briefly entering his mind, mask and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have you walking around looking like an adult ninja when you haven't earned the ranks? I don't think so.\" Kakashi said blandly. \"I'm sure we'll think of something, in the mean time, lets get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they turned to leave, they suddenly noticed that most of the village had gathered at the end of the bridge, looking at the ninja in awe. Tazuna and Inari were at the head of the crowd. Nobody said a word as the ninja approached...until Inari suddenly let out a snotty sounding sob, running forward and embracing Naruto, burying his face in his midsection. \"Naruto! You...you...you did it! You really did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, patting Inari on the head. \"Yeah...WE did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupted from the crowd as everyone celebrated the ousting of the villains who had been preventing the construction of their bridge, Tazuna proudly declaring that the bridge would be named for the hero who had saved it, Naruto himself. A kind woman in the crowd also willingly donated a sheet to Naruto, who immediately wrapped it around his body in a toga like fashion, stripping off his jacket and shirt before doing so. Nobody made mention of Naruto's size outside a few compliments about how robust and strong he looked, so thankful were they for his assistance. Naruto's heart swelled with pride at his accomplishment and joy at how well he was treated. It made him feel...good. Helping people, protecting people, making bonds with people...Naruto was swiftly learning exactly what was most important to him.</span></div></div>",

The sun was shining, a warm breeze blew through his hair, and the cool grass felt wonderful beneath his feet. He was a hero! A real life hero! For the first time he'd had people look at him with happiness, respect, maybe even a little awe. Naruto liked it; he liked it a lot! Linking his hands behind his neck, he the over-sized blond couldn't help smiling, things were looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi grinned and hummed in satisfaction. All was going to plan. He could sense the awe and fear caused by his host. True, it had been a paltry amount, barely satisfying and not truly fit for a being of his immense powers. But, it was a beginning. His enhanced chakra had spread far and wide in the little brat's body, stretching, pushing outward, filling his vessel with supernatural strength and toughness. His power pressed at the seal always, now, just waiting for a change in pressure, any excuse to push outward once more, to continue his great work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi cocked his head, his long ear hearing something in the distance, a sound beyond sound. Nearby, hearts cried out for revenge; evil intentions focused on his container. The fox prepared...the brat would need chakra soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And he would have it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto first realized something was wrong when a crossbow bold zipped by his cheek, drawing a shallow cut. Whirling around, he looked with wide eyes as a mercenary covered in mud and leaves dropped his crossbow and charged out of the bushes, sword in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ambush!\" Sasuke yelled from the front of the group, leaping for a tree and bringing his hand to his lips. Kakashi and Sakura spread out as well, making space; each team member found themselves with one or two enemies in the blink of an eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kunai was in Naruto's hand without thought, and as he fell back in an awkward back stance he swiped wildly at the enemy's weapon. The angle was bad. The enemy had a charge behind the blow, and his weapon had the better reach. Yet when the two weapons connected with a loud <b>clang</b>, the sword was torn from the wicked man's grip and went flying into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercenary howled in pain, shaking his hands and leaping backward. Naruto stared; it looked like the force of their weapons meeting had launched his sword away and broken the man's fingers! But Naruto hadn't felt a thing; he hadn't even moved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning fiercely, Naruto advanced on the Mercenary, idly noting his teammates; they seemed to be doing fine. He could do this. He was so strong! This creep didn't stand a chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creep had friends. At his panicked cry, three other men ran out of the woods, surrounding the blond ninja. Inexperienced, and focusing too much on his first enemy, Naruto was completely unprepared as he was surrounded. All four enemies launched themselves at him, grabbing him however they could and forcing him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shouted and struggled, pushing up as hard as he could with the weight of four grown men on his back. Over the sound of one of Sasuke's pyro jutsus, and some weird chirping noise, Naruto heard the <i>shink</i> sound of a blade being drawn. The young ninja tensed, pupils contracting, as he frantically gathered his chakra to try and get out get out <i>get out</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thump</b> <i>pop pop pop</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted as he felt an odd pulsing in his hands, his fingers felt odd, heavy, and his grip scrabbled as the ground seemed to shift under his palms and fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thump</b> <i>creek</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood and chakra rushed to Naruto's tired muscles, filling them with energy. His skin felt hot, and weirdly tight. Naruto felt a pounding in his bones, his muscles strained and cramped as they pushed harder than ever to get him free, and the enemies on his back started feeling lighter....and lighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thump POP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty roar, Naruto tensed his arms and legs and <i>pushed</i> himself up. His tangled-up toga pulled at his chest and neck, strangling him almost as much as his enemies. He tugged at his neck, growling as he heard his emergency clothes tear slightly, but he took a deep grateful breath of free air. He heard shouts of surprise and fear as he rose to his feet, but he couldn't make out the words in his battle haze. Glaring at his enemies, Naruto snorted when he saw the brave idiot with the drawn knife drop his weapon and fall back a step. Really, he wouldn't have been nearly so freaked out if he'd realized the first goon's friends were so much <i>tinier</i> than their boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding forward, Naruto batted one of his enemies aside with one arm. The little jerk was blown off his feet, slamming into a nearby tree. As the other three tried to run, Naruto reached forward and snagged one by the neck with one hand, easily lifting the midget up to eye level. Glaring into his terrified enemy's eyes, Naruto raised his other fist and bopped him on the head. The tiny man's eyes instantly rolled up in their sockets and Naruto dropped his unconscious enemy in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond's ears twitched has he heard two thunks in the distance. Looking up, he moved his eyes from Sakura, who was in the end of a throwing stance, down the trail. The two little men who'd tried to get away were lying in the path, knocked out, with two head-sized rocks rolling to a stop beside them. Across the way, Kakashi and Sasuke had long since finished their own fights and were busy tying up and/or looting the would-be ambushers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, Sakura-Chan!\" Naruto yelled. The blond winced; wow that had been loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned to flash a grin and thumbs-up, but froze, staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned, looking down at his friend. What was wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. He was looking a <i>long way down</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Naruto walked toward his pink haired team-mate. With each step closer, it became more obvious. How his toga had pulled tight and ridden up so high he'd have to turn it sideways and wrap it around his hips to stay decent. How his strides got him close so <i>fast</i>. And when he stood by his friend, her head was level with Naruto's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto swallowed, quickly adjusting his barely-covering-<i>stuff</i> toga to wrap it around his waist like a bath towel. Blushing slightly, Naruto tied off the cloth quickly and rubbed at his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...poof? Eheh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poof.\" Sakura agreed weakly.<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone stared at Naruto in wonder, even Kakashi. It wasn't often you saw a tall man with the proportions of a kid. Kakashi, who was once eye level with Naruto, was now staring at the young man's chest. Naruto had always had a larger than life personality but at kid size it was mostly just annoying; at his current height, however, it was difficult not to feel a little bit overwhelmed just by his presence. Kakashi quickly composed himself and said, \"Well now...how about that hospital visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled and said, \"Y-Yeah, seems like maybe that would be a good idea sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team moved on again, Naruto quickly taking the lead, his big feet stomping audibly as he charged forward. His teammates were quick to leap into the trees above them to move more quickly and Naruto followed suit, aiming for a lower, smaller branch to get a boost to the higher ones...only for his bare feet to snap the branch in two, sending him falling to the ground with a yelp, the wood turning to dust beneath his stompers as he landed, hard, on the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aim higher you idiot, you weigh more than you used to.\" Sasuke called out, taking the lead from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr! I'll show you Sasuke!\" Naruto shouted, a vein popping on his forehead as he charged forward. Before he took a leap his shoulder accidentally clipped the trunk of a nearby tree, knocking it down with barely any effort. Naruto barely noticed as he was already in the air, aiming for the higher branches. He landed on a particularly thick one but it steal creaked alarmingly under his weight. Thinking fast, Naruto jumped again, this time spreading his weight about on two other branches as he landed, giving him a more solid jumping off point. He grinned as he soared through the air, easily catching up to and overtaking Sasuke, wind whipping around Naruto's body as his powerful leg muscles propelled him mightily forward. Sakura was caught in one of the cross breezes, lifting her up with a yelp and nearly sending her flying before she regained her composure. She felt the usual pang of annoyance but couldn't help being slightly impressed. Naruto was like a force of nature, indomitable and unstoppable, moving ever forward. She weakly chuckled as she imagined another ambush. Who would even try? It would be like attempting to stop a hurricane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi, having seen far more impressive feats in his life than just an overgrown kid running around, wasn't in nearly as much awe but even he was impressed with how fast Naruto was adapting to a bigger body, finding new ways to move that suited his size and weight. Naruto, on the other hand, wasn't thinking too hard about anything except how COOL it was to be moving so fast! He took a particularly high leap and let out a whoop of joy as he sailed high above the trees, able to see the forest laid out before him like a carpet, before falling to the earth, purposefully missing the branches and landing on the ground, making a little impact crater where he landed, just outside the village gates. Dust surrounded him as he stood up to his full height, hands on his hips, a grin on his face. Once the dust cleared he knew he cut quite the impressive figure to anyone who was watching...though nobody was. Slightly disappointed, Naruto tilted his head up, shading his eyes with one hand as he took in the size of the gate. \"Heh, wouldn't it be cool if I had to duck to get in through there? Everyone would be like little dolls compared to me...hehehehehehe~ Being able to just step over it would be really cool too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's heart started to pound faster as he imagined that. If people were impressed and treating him like a hero now, just how much would they look up to him if he was THAT big, both figuratively and literally? Maybe he'd be strong enough to be the youngest Hokage in the history of the village...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was knocked from these fantasies as Kakashi and the others arrived, his sensei bopping him on the back of his head. \"Hospital. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Naruto mumbled, walking forward, his mind still shuffling the ideas of being not just big but really, REALLY big in his head. It didn't take long to reach the hospital but Naruto relished the attention he got. Whispers, impressed looks, people finally having to look UP at him rather than down AT him. A couple of people were intimidated and seemed to go out of their way to avoid him but Naruto couldn't be bothered by the negative attention when so much positive attention was being lavished on him. He thumbed his nose with a grin at a passing kid who laughed before walking into the hospital. The receptionist froze as she saw the rather huge kid walking through the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...can I help you?\" She asked, thinking to herself \"Oh I can't WAIT to hear the explanation behind THIS one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hopefully.\" Kakashi said, indicating Naruto. \"As you can see we have a bit of a problem on our hands and need my student here to be examined. Full body, every test, no holding back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sensei, hang on, I didn't agree to any weird tests!\" Naruto said, looking a little nervous, which looked rather odd on such a large person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, nobody is going to be doing any weird experiments.\" The receptionist said soothingly. \"Now then, Dr. Ando will be able to see you immediately. He's right down the hall, last door on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi turned to Sasuke and Sakura and said, \"You two can report back to the Hokage. Let him know what's going on and I'll supplement the report with whatever we learn from this examination. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Sakura said, nodding with determination while Sasuke just shrugged and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Ando reacted much the same way everyone else did when they spied Naruto, eyes widening as his mouth dropped open slightly. \"W-Well! Naruto! You've certainly...changed since your last check up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, blushing slightly. \"Uh...I'm just a growing boy? Ehehehehehe...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, let me just...draw some blood.\" Dr. Ando said, pulling out a needle and sticking it into Naruto's arm. Naruto winced, expecting a sharp pain...but felt nothing. The doctor seemed a bit surprised and pressed harder against Naruto's skin, the needle not pushing through at all. \"Odd...\" He mumbled as he pushed even harder, finally managing to pierce the skin, drawing some blood out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rubbed his arm before noticing the wound almost immediately healing, much faster than it normally did, even with his...special abilities. The doctor didn't seem to notice, putting a band aid down over the \"wound\". As he proceeded with the usual tests of reflex, blood pressure, and heart and lungs, Dr. Ando asked Naruto questions. \"So, what brought this sudden growth about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was on a mission and I was fighting against someone and I was losing and I started to use my chakra and...uh...well...\" Naruto rattled off, looking over to Kakashi for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He used an excessive amount of chakra.\" Kakashi explained, not wanting to alarm the doctor by mentioning how the Fox's chakra had almost gotten out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah! And I could feel all this tightness in my skin and my heart pounded and I felt this swelling, popping feeling all over my body. And I got big!\" Naruto concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...from what I'm seeing here, it seems like your skin has taken on an unnatural toughness. It's just as soft and pliable as regular skin but my needle could barely push through, almost like you're wearing body armor of some kind. I wouldn't advise getting stabbed with a kunai but you might find it not hurting as much as it otherwise would have. Not only that but there's a strange tightness and density in your muscles, like they're coiled up and ready to spring. This is not a bad thing, mind you, because it just means that you're a lot stronger than you look...by quite a large margin. I'm going to run some blood tests just to be sure but from what I can tell you're as healthy as can be...better than most in fact! Whatever is causing this seems to have nothing but positive effects for you. Either way, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doctor left the room Kakashi turned to Naruto and said, \"You're one lucky kid. I was expecting him to say this added size and mass was having a detrimental effect on your body. I think it's obvious what is causing this though: the Kyuubi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no kidding...\" Naruto mumbled, touching his stomach slightly. \"But I mean...at least I'm not dying or anything, right? This is a good thing! Finally this stupid fox is doing something positive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, this is not a game.\" Kakashi warned sternly, staring Naruto in the eyes...which he could do, because Naruto was sitting. \"You started growing when you were in a tight spot and used a lot of chakra; for the time being you can't use any excessive amounts of chakra, understand? In the long run, you're going to have to learn better chakra control as well so you don't end up getting any bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto mulled this over in his mind. If he learned more chakra control he'd stop getting bigger...people would stop looking up to him in awe...he'd go back to being just a runty kid who nobody paid any attention to...and this feeling of power, of weight, of significance would go away...but what if Kakashi was right? What if it was too dangerous to be playing around with this? What if he lost control? He frowned and turned to face his sensei, his mind made up.</span></div></div>",

The over-sized ninja couldn't help feeling a bit smug when his aggressive posing made his big bad sensei take a step back. Well, maybe 'medium bad' sensei. 'Mini sensei'....anyway! No <i>way</i> was he going back to the way things were! In fact, the more Naruto thought about it, everything had been <i>great</i> since he got so big; his team was nicer, fighting was easier, and nobody had treated him bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, hold on a second.\" Kakashi held up his hands, feeling a cold sweat on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was not holding on to anything! Mind focusing, the blond crossed his fingers and pulled on his chakra <i>hard</i>. A visible haze of blue burning into the world around him, kicking up a windstorm in the office that forced Kakshi to skid back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing was happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi laughed as he saw the brat's chakra pathways dilate so much that it <i>had</i> to hurt. The fox spirit's face lit up with a mean-spirited smirk as the titanic being wrapped his giant arms around his stockpile of enhanced chakra and held it close while his cage howled from the strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the brat <i>likes it</i>. Too bad for him Kurama doesn't do tricks on demand. Your body is MINE to enhance, brat! YOU HEAR ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox scowled as it saw a few wisps of his chakra get yanked along into the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Fine, kid. Steal a few scraps. Let's see how much you enjoy things without my help. Either way, you'll just come back with an even <i>bigger</i> appetite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced at the strain, and slowly brought down his arms.  He didn't feel any different. No stretching, no rush of power. Kakashi-sensei was still glaring from around the same level...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh...um, I guess I got carried away?\" Naruto asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensei was not amused. Kakashi was quick to offer punishment in the form of a powerful bop to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Naruto winced, rubbing his scalp. \"Mean! What was that for, huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I specifically told you <i>not</i> to pull a lot of chakra. They probably felt that in Kumo!\" Kakashi raged. \"And what if that had worked, huh? Do you know how much it would affect you this time? You're inside a hospital full of sick, immobile patients!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down, ashamed. He hadn't thought about that, he'd just been so excited! The thought of being Konoha's own giant protector was just so awesome to think about. But he didn't want to blow up the hospital! Heroes don't do stuff like that; no, he should have waited until some giant lizard monster attacked, and then stood outside the gates while a few leaves blew by in the wind, and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Naruto let out a startled gasp, as he felt his body give a <i>wriggle</i>. He swallowed heavily as his heart started pounding in his veins. Suddenly a lot more worried about being <i>inside</i>, and super mad he hadn't thought this through, Naruto looked around frantically, eyes locking on a small window behind Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess! An outer wall, with escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei - \" Naruto started, wincing as he felt his bones start buzzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still mad at you.\" Kakashi grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sensei, I think it woahhh!\" Naruto shouted in alarm as his legs and arms shot outward, his height shooting up until his head smacked into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong; the growth had never been that fast or uneven before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down, Naruto watched his Sensei jump back with wide eyes as his hands and feet popped out larger one digit at a time. <i>Pop pop pop</i>. As he felt his left foot lurch out, Naruto teetered off balance until he fell hard onto his side, knocking over medical supplies and tipping the trash out onto the floor. Looking up, the young ninja scrabbled with his hands, knocking his teacher in the side and accidentally kicking the bed into the exam room door.  Feeling a bit like he'd been stretched into taffy, the weirdly lanky teen ignored his teacher shouting and yelled in triumph as his hands found the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting with effort as his not-yet-grown muscles pulled along a <i>lot</i> more weight, Naruto tugged himself into the window, and started cramming himself through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snap</i>. Naruto groaned and wriggled as he felt his shoulders pushing out, quickly becoming wider than the window. One of his arms was stuck along his side, the other dangled down outside the hospital, his fingertips barely finding a grip on the top of the window a story below. Already feeling pressure as his muscles started catching up with his bones, Naruto quickly used his increasing strength to pull himself forward. He felt the lower window's frame start to crumple a bit in his grip as his widening chest and bicep wedged him even more snugly in place.  The final nail in the coffin was when Naruto felt his hips start growing; by that time the window frame had pulled tight around his middle, and he was officially bigger on both ends with nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Third Hokage's first meeting with \"Konoha's new giant protector\" was from outside the hospital, along with several ANBU. Naruto did his best to pretend he had any dignity left as he waited, stuck in a window, for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi sensei did not hesitate to let Naruto know that while he waited, half the hospital staff had managed to clear the office doorway he'd smashed shut, and had therefore seen his trapped, naked butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep...dignity.<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was silence as the Third Hokage stared at Naruto's face, the younger ninja's cheeks turning redder every second that the older man refused to speak, his hands tucked behind his back, eyes inscrutable. The ANBU, all masked, were equally as silent and staring, making Naruto gulp loudly. Wildly, he suddenly realized his butt itched and he couldn't even do anything to scratch it! And people back there were staring at him too! It was enough to break out into a cold sweat! Sure, it had been nice to be getting looks before but this was ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, ending his silent torment, the Third Hokage sighed, eyes closing briefly as he put his pipe in his mouth and lit it, taking a long draw on it before turning his eyes back up to Naruto. \"So, I've heard you've been getting into some trouble Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You could say that...\" Naruto mumbled, his voice still surprisingly loud. The ANBU shifted slightly, surprised by the volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel confident in confiding in you that we are as surprised as you. When my successor, the Fourth Hokage, sealed the Fox within you there was never any mention of this being a possibility. It seems the Fox is even craftier than we had first believed. We are entirely in uncharted territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped again; he was used to adults being more cryptic and mysterious about his situation. It was almost uncomfortable the Third Hokage was being so frank. \"So....what are we...uh...going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is an excellent question.\" The old man replied, smiling slightly. \"Under the circumstances I would say that it would be wisest to bar you from performing your duties as a ninja, to make sure that you stay hidden and never access your chakra again, or at least until we figure out a way to prevent the Fox from exacerbating this problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! Come on old man, you can't do that to me!\" Naruto protested, his embarrassment washed briefly away in a storm of outrage, his dream of being Hokage seeming to disappear before his very eyes. \"I can still fight and do missions and stuff without chakra! Look how big I am! I'm really strong too! I-I can...I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled desperately his confines, the window frame creaking and groaning under the strain of his giant body. The Third Hokage raised his hand, stemming Naruto's words, the giant ninja stopping, cracks evident all along the wall where he struggled. \"I said that would be the wisest decision, not the one I was intending to pursue. Trying to keep you from doing your duties as a ninja would be like attempting to contain a hurricane; in the end, it would merely spiral out of all control. Instead, I think it would be best if we place a secondary seal on your chakra, making it more difficult to access the foreign chakra inside you. I believe Kakashi knows of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do but it does rely on the recipient's will power to keep in place and Naruto has already proven himself to be a bit...enthusiastic when it comes to his new...abilities.\" Kakashi's muffled voice was heard on the other side of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll be good! I promise!\" Naruto said, eyes pleading with the old man. \"If it means I can still be with my team and go on missions and stuff I'll do whatever it takes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected nothing less of you.\" Sarutobi said, nodding his head. \"Very well! I will leave the rest to you Kakashi. After you're finished with the situation here I will expect a more comprehensive report on the your latest mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto suddenly reached his free arm out, holding his palm out in front of the older man as he turned to walk away. \"W-Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ANBU moved swiftly, pinning Naruto's arm down, stepping on his fingers, keeping him from moving. \"O-Ouch! Hey! What gives?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking the situation through, Naruto grunted and lifted his arm up, clenching his fingers into a fist and flexing his bicep, throwing the ANBU to the ground around him. Before things could escalate the Third Hokage shouted, \"ENOUGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone held still, Naruto's arm flopping back down to the ground. \"What is it Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still kind of...um...you know...naked.\" He whispered this last word but it was still perfectly audible to all present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...unfortunately there is no clothing in the Leaf Village that will fit your current size. Even the Akimichi clan's clothing is made to grow, not to fit one already grown. It will take a few days but I'll find you more suitable attire, something closer to what you're used to wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks old man! I really appreciate it! Everything!\" Naruto said, a smile lighting up his features. It was reassuring to see through all the changes and uncertainties, Naruto was still Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the mean time, I'm sure the hospital will be more than willing to provide something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lord Third!\" A chorus of voices intoned from inside the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Hokage and his entourage departed, leaving Naruto alone with Kakashi and the hospital staff. \"Hey Kakashi-sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I gonna get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took at least five people on each side, gently pushing and pulling before Naruto was eased out of the window frame, the glass and wood damaged beyond repair. Naruto, sitting cross legged and covering himself, chuckled nervously and said, \"Uh...I'll pay to fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider the funds from your last mission spent, kid.\" Kakashi said, crossing his arms in front of the enormous ninja. Even sitting down Naruto was taller and quite a bit wider than Kakashi; even though Naruto's height had increased, somewhat irregularly due to his uncontrolled chakra grab, he still had the thickness and proportions of a 13 year old, making him heavier and stronger than even an adult would be at the same size. \"Now, while we were getting you unstuck the hospital was also kind enough to sew you a temporary covering for your...shame. So thank the nice staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned and bowed. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody responded beyond a few nervous nods, three people handing Naruto what looked like a table cloth but was actually some crudely fashioned underwear made from bed sheets. It was shaped like a loincloth in front and back, the sides bare, while a loop of fabric went under his crotch, covering anything that might be visible from below. After struggling a bit to get them on, Naruto turned to Kakashi who indicated the door. \"You're not too huge to move through the halls, get a move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and squeezed himself through the doorway, having to turn and wiggle a bit to make it through, his shoulders and chest being the most troublesome. Luckily he managed to get through with only slightly damaging the door frame. Even out in the spacious halls of the hospital Naruto found his shoulders bumping against either wall, his back and shoulders hitting the ceiling. \"This sucks...I feel like a little kid in a tunnel or something....\" Naruto grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have yourself to blame.\" Kakashi reminded him, standing in front and clearing the way for the giant Genin. Once outside, Naruto gratefully rose to his feet and stretched, sighing happily, the warm sun feeling good against his mostly exposed body. His hands fell to his hips and he looked around proudly, feeling a sense of pride again as he realized how far he could see from his new vantage point. \"Gonna have to think about finding a new place to live...something a little...bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first.\" Kakashi said, drawing Naruto's attention down around his thighs. \"I need to get that seal on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! And after that, I think I'm going to take a nice long walk around the village~\" Naruto said, smirking slightly. Now that he was somewhat clothed and less embarrassed he was starting to enjoy his size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked away, the crowds parting in awe of the towering teen, three other teens were watching from a distance. \"So...you ever see anything like that before, Temari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I have Kankuro. What about you, Gaara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...maybe these Chunin Exams are going to be even more interesting than we thought.\"</span></div></div>",

The halls in the Tower is too damn small for the kid to fit through and it'd be uncomfortable, and I'm not gonna be the one to find someone to clean the mess he leaves behind.\" He said shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto interjected since he didn't like not having a voice in this conversation as he walked over and looked down at them, \"Hey don't I get a say in this? Don't worry Kakashi-Sensei, I promise I won't get into any more trouble.\" He said to him as the man sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what I'm most afraid of, but if you said you got this and if you're a ninja then you're practically an adult, then who am I to judge? Just stay from touching the chakra, no matter how enticing it might be until I get back okay?\" Kakashi asked him sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the subconscious desire to take in even more of the chakra, Naruto also wants to keep being a ninja and maybe even become the first giant hokage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I'll try to keep it under control.\" Naruto promised as he nodded in appreciation and turned to his fellow Jounin, \"Alright, off we go.\" He said and they walked away, leaving Naruto by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy thought to himself, 'Alright so the Chunin Exams are coming up soon, maybe I should go and train a bit? Though, I am pretty strong as is, it should be a piece of cake, or maybe go walk around the village for a bit more?' He considered the pros and cons and came to a decision. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto grinned as he walked along the outskirts of the village, hands behind his head with the sun shining at his back. Running ahead of him was a massive shadow, covering half the street. It was so funny to see the villagers stop what they were doing whenever his massive body blocked out the sun; they'd look around confused before freezing, and then slowly looked waaaaaaay up to meet his gaze. Some of them jumped up and ran, or at least Naruto thought they were running. Their tiny little legs didn't really help them reach anything more than a brisk walk to the giant blond. One lady fainted after she turned to look out of her second story window to see Naruto cheerfully waving at her, his eyes just clearing the window sill (on the second floor!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to walk in the street though; after crawling through the hospital Naruto had started to worry about having space to move around, but while he was <i>really</i> tall, he wasn't as wide as the carts in the road. Naruto wondered if he counted as traffic now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-id. Hey KID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, before peering down. Standing in front of him, and looking a bit impatient, was another Jonin. Dropping to a knee, the giant ninja crouched down to speak to the superior ninja on sort-of eye level. He did his best not to laugh when he noticed his breath was blowing the guy's hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Naruto asked. The Jonin winced a bit and covered his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a message for ya',\" the older ninja waved his hand in greeting. \"Hokage's set up a chamber for the sealing; it's an old emergency bunker with a wide door and a large chamber only a few yards in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto huffed (the Jonin's hair was now a complete mess) and crossed his arms petulantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think I need a dumb seal. I've got everything under control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" The Jonin offered a not-at-all convincing sound of agreement as he turned and started walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hurriedly rose to his feet and took a few quick steps, only to freeze when he realized he'd overtaken his guide. Laughing sheepishly, Naruto waited for his tiny guide to get a bit of a lead and started a slow awkward lope behind him. After the first near miss, the Jonin was keeping half an eye on the kid; he'd almost gotten kicked into a wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fairly short order, the pair made it to a large iron door. Well....large-ish. Naruto was going to have to crawl again, but at least he wouldn't get stuck. The Jonin quickly gave a series of carefully timed knocks, then led the way down the newly opened passage, Naruto blocking out nearly all of the outside light behind him. As the gening slid his legs through, the door slowly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi frowned as he heard the sound of highly secure doors closing. The Jonin guide hadn't entered the office with him; not against protocol exactly, but usually the Hokage wanted his visitors announced...and watched from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarutobi looked up in surprise and a bit of irritation as he tucked away his pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakashi. I thought you'd be placing the seal on Naruto right now. Was there something too important to wait? I can hardly imagine what it could be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir...\" Kakashi answered slowly. \"Didn't you summon me for an immediate debriefing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hokage's answer was to toss off his casual robes, showing carefully arranged bracers and ever-ready kunai pouches beneath, as he jumped out the window. Kakshi followed without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not.\" Sarutobi answered shortly as the pair hopped along the rooftops in search of one giant ninja. \"Who told you this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Konoha Jonin. Or at least he looked like one. I've seen him in the village though I don't know him by name.\" Kakashi answered, cursing himself for his antisocial attitude to his colleagues.  \"His clothing was in the pre-approved arrangement to show he was on Konoha business, and he smelled like a local.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll want a full description.\" Sarutobi muttered as the pair finally found a mostly-cleared street that showed evidence of multiple civilians running off in a hurry. Given Naruto's appearence and...relative levels of tact, this seemed like a good lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto woke up with a splitting headache, to find himself lying on his back in a small out-of-the way training ground. Sitting up, the giant ninja blinked in confusion as he took in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" He muttered, stretching out his limbs and shaking some feeling into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing he remembered was crawling....and it was dark? Naruto winced, the headache flaring up a bit. No, he'd crawled out of the hospital, because it was super tiny in there, and Kakashi had been staring at him with his creepy red eye...no. No that wasn't right....Kakashi had followed him out.  He'd gotten that seal jiji wanted...or was Kakashi called away? There'd been a weird Jonin guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his head and sicked up a bit in the grass, his headache made his stomach hurt. Panting, the ninja raised a shaking arm to wipe sweat from his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened? And why couldn't he remember?<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto tried to remember what had just happened to him a soft sound like cat's feet made itself known to him at the edge of the clearing. The training ground, like most things in the Leaf Village, was situated somewhere in the forest but Naruto wasn't exactly familiar with which one this was. It seemed that it was far enough away from the Village, however, that the bustling sounds of commerce and every day life was gone completely, thus allowing Naruto to hear the soft step of Kakashi's arrival. \"K-Kakashi-sensei?\" Naruto asked, his voice shaking slightly, his eyes a bit unfocused. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got some good ears on you kid.\" Kakashi replied, stepping forward, one hand in his pocket. \"So...care to tell me what happened since I've been gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Naruto said, closing his eyes and pressing the butt of his palm against them, lips turning down in a grimace as he tried to remember. \"I was walking around the village...then this guy came up to me and said...something about sealing? The old man said...wait...or did you say...or...argh! I can't remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's voice rose slightly, pounding his fist into the ground. Kakashi stopped walking towards the huge kid, bracing himself as the entire training ground shook. \"Easy Naruto, easy. Don't push yourself. Just tell me everything you can remember, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and sat down, gingerly, cross legged, eyes still closed. \"You had to go leave to talk to the old man, that much I remember for sure. I was walking around and kind of...you know...showing myself off to the village. So people would know I'm here and protecting them and stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you could get some admiring looks I'm sure.\" Kakashi intoned dully, though there was a hint of a smile under his mask in spite of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled, rubbing the back of his head. \"Yeah, maybe...anyway...things start getting foggy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many people do you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was...just one guy...and he was dressed like...like a Jonin so...you know, it was a uniform and...the face wasn't familiar...I don't think...\" Naruto scratched his head, closed eyelids scrunching a little bit as he struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so one guy, that sounds about right.\" Kakashi encouraged. \"Then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! A cave! No...some kind of...underground warehouse?\" Naruto excitedly recalled, eyes flying open, a hand pounding his open palm. \"We went in and then everything gets fuzzy again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Underground warehouse, huh...\" Kakashi mumbled, thinking about all the possible locations that fit that description. \"So it's possible we're dealing with more than one person here after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I remember crawling down a hallway but then everything goes dark and I woke up here with a huge headache.\" Naruto finished, opening his eyes and looking down at Kakashi for the first time in that moment. Way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sensei! You're...smaller!\" Naruto gasped, struggling to his feet, measuring himself against the Jonin. He looked around wildly, noticing how his head was near the canopy of the trees, his teacher standing about even with his knees now, looking even more child like next to the enormous child. \"Which means...aw man! I'm bigger again! What the heck?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Naruto, lets just take it easy. Whatever happened to you down...you were obviously forced into using the Fox's chakra again. You've only grown about another...five, six feet? I'd say you're about twenty feet tall now, even height with a two story building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto remembered how just a few moments ago (to him anyway) he had been about eye height to a second story window. Now it seemed as though he'd have to bend over slightly to be at that height. \"So much for being indoors...\" He mumbled in annoyance, tugging at his makeshift undergarments. The growth had forcibly loosened the sheets, leaving him with something that looked less like a loincloth and more like a tight fitting pair of briefs. \"The old man better get me some fitting clothes fast unless everyone wants to see my ass running around town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shouted, his voice powerful and booming to Kakashi's ears, several birds taking flight just from the sheer volume of Naruto's bellow. Kakashi sighed and indicated Naruto should lower himself. The rambunctious kid did as he was told and sank back down to a seated position, his bright blue eyes fixed fully on Kakashi. It was...undeniably intimidating, even for a seasoned warrior like Kakashi. \"Listen...I'm going to share with you some information that I normally never would because our situation has just gone from bad to worse. You understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Naruto said simply, crossing his arms, a look of confusion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You're not supposed to. I'm sure you're aware of the Chunin exams coming up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Everyone knows about those! It's my first shot to climb the ladder! To rank up! To get closer to my goal of being Hokage!\" Naruto grinned, clenching his hand into a fist, breathing slightly faster in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, this year we're hosting the exams with another village, the Hidden Sand Village. How much do you know about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...they...have...sand?\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nothing, then. Alright, tensions between our villages have been high for a long time for...various reasons. I'm not going to go into all the gritty details right now because it's not important to the current situation. We have reason to believe that the Sand Village may be...planning something, in collusion with a smaller Hidden Village that has recently been formed. The details are shaky right now since they've been very good about hiding their tracks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think these Sand punks are going to try and pull something during the exam?!\" Naruto growled. \"No way! I'm not going to let anything get in my way! Just point me at these jerks and I'll--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get knocked out.\" Kakashi interrupted, Naruto's voice sounding like it was being broadcast over a loudspeaker whenever he grew more impassioned. \"That Jonin you met today probably was working, in some form, with them. That's the hypothesis at least. Nothing is certain except that someone is showing some kind of interest in you and, judging by how you had to use the Fox's chakra, it can't be anything good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...why would I use the Fox's chakra, though, if it was just one guy? I'm even stronger than I look, my breath was messing with that guy before! I could have just swatted him aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing.\" Kakashi nodded. \"Which leads me to believe there was more than one opponent down there. One ninja is one thing, even a skilled one can be overwhelmed by pure force. But pure force can also be overwhelmed by skill and numbers. Either way, it's even more important now that we get you sealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kakashi didn't say, knowing that Naruto would only get even more riled up than he already was, is that he wasn't sure if the giant Genin would be allowed to participate in the Chunin Exams due to his...size predicament. \"Let someone else tell him that he can't participate...see how well it goes.\" Kakashi thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's our next move now, sensei?\" Naruto asked, leaning in slightly, casting a shadow over the smaller adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our next move is to get you sealed, and quickly.\" Kakashi said, firmly. \"I know you think you can handle this and I'm not going to say you can't but we're talking about a real threat to the entire village here. If you're forced to use this chakra again you might cause some real damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know...\" Naruto said, sighing, not liking the idea of being forced into cutting off parts of his chakra, even if it wasn't technically his. \"I mean...the Fox is in MY body, right? So doesn't that make it my chakra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought that to himself, much to the chagrin of the Fox within, the monstrous chakra construct growling and seeing red. Naruto felt a shiver run up and down his spine but shook it off. \"Anyway...if these guys are so bad why are they trying to make me bigger and stronger? Seems pretty dumb to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it? Imagine, for a moment, being the size you are and running down the street without paying too much attention. Think of the damage you could cause by being too excited or careless. You're not the type to sit still after all. Now imagine if you were twice your size. Or a dozen times larger. Think of all the chaos you could unleash with just walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as he considered the possibility. \"I never thought of it like that before...do you really think I could get THAT big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not ruling it out.\" Kakashi muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, let's just get this...seal thing over with already.\" Naruto sighed, getting to his feet. \"Do you want me to carry you, sensei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell I do, I'm not your pet.\" Kakashi replied. Naruto grinned and bent down slightly, laying his heavy palm on top of Kakashi's head and rubbing it gently, messing up his hair and nearly knocking the older man down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do look and feel like one though!\" Naruto chuckled, straightening back up and walking. \"Then you'd better keep up sensei! I've got long legs and I wanna use 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi quickly took off after Naruto, the giant ninja's steps causing the ground to tremble. \"This is going to be a very long day...\"</span></div></div>",

The giant genin poked at his stomach dubiously. He now had a giant black circle of symbols surrounding where his normal seal appeared when he channeled the Fox's chakra. Except he <i>wasn't</i> channeling that chakra, so it was just a big black circle tatoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks dumb!\" Naruto complained, flopping onto his back with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto coughed as the air around his head filled with a cloud of dirt, kicked up by his weight and the speed of his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that!\" Mini-sensei scolded, hopping back. \"And it doesn't look dumb! That seal should bolster your original, and help prevent the Fox flooding your system when your focus lapses. Just remember it's powered by <i>your</i> will, so while it pushes against the Fox you need to be careful not to pull any of it's chakra, because the new seal doesn't stop that at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nWithin the seal, a roughed-up looking, loopy fox snorted in its healing sleep. Although it wasn't awake, some impulse told the fox instinctively that it was time for a diabolical laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muahahahaaaa....<i>snore</i>.....hahahahaaaaa.\"<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Naruto frowned, turning on his side to keep his teacher in view. \"So if I <i>wanted</i> to get bigger...\" Naruto pictured himself in his mind's eye, trying to work this out, and imagined himself stretching taller, and taller, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut that out!\" Kakashi yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Naruto's eyes popped open. Looking down, he blinked in surprise at how faded and frayed the seal looked. A moment of focus later, and it was back to looking like a dumb, solid black circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, the seal doesn't fight you. It <i>can't</i>, all of it's force is directed inward. You can override it at any time. And you <i>must not grow again</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grumbled, turning onto his back. He didn't understand what the big deal was; there were like a million ways being this big could be super helpful. There were probably whole new missions that nobody thought of before that he could do, or maybe Choji's clan did those already, but so what! They had to use a technique to grow, so that meant they couldn't <i>stay</i> big, right? So Naruto was a...some sort of per-ma-nent al-ter-na-tive...thing. Yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also you're sleeping here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WHAAAAT?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at his teacher in horror. He couldn't sleep here! It was cold, and uncomfortable, and dirty, and...and he was almost naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi winced in pain, and hoped the Hokage had dispersed some officials to explain away all these freakishly loud outbursts. It was bound to upset the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" he sighed, rubbing his head. \"You <i>could</i> have used your apartment about ten feet ago, but then you had the <i>genius</i> idea to grow again. And now even the emergency shelters are off the table; you're just too big! There's some warehouses we can re-purpose by tomorrow, probably, though we'll have to buy out the people leasing the space or commandeer it which would piss them off. We'll figure something out. The point is tonight you don't have a lot of options, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Naruto whined softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi walked over and patted his student on the shoulder, an option he only had because the kid was lying down. He wondered if the kid even felt it, but as Naruto's expression softened he figured maybe it was the thought that counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just for one night. We'll have people keeping watch. <i>I'll</i> be keeping watch, personally. It's not ideal, but it'll be safe. Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto slowly drifted off to sleep, Kakashi just hoped that he could keep that promise.<br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

The only scrap of clothing he had was getting more and more tattered by the moment as his big body shifted around, trying to get comfortable, finding that the only way he could get even remotely satisfied with his position was on his back, legs stretched out, the cold air nipping at his long limbs. He managed to fall into a fitful sleep but he shivered and his mind was filled with half formed images of foxes and toy houses and screams. Everyone's warnings were starting to weigh heavy in his mind. What if the villagers truly did despise him even more than they already did because of this? What if he was an unsustainable burden on everyone? It was hurtful and frustrating and all Naruto wanted was to be acknowledged, to be useful, to be someone that people looked up to...and not just literally either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night sluggishly passed and Naruto never really felt like he got much good sleep so it was with heavy lids that he opened his eyes and yawned, mouth stretching wide open, the area rumbling slightly from the intensity of his bodily action. A tiny voice suddenly piped up as Naruto finished, making him jump slightly. \"Wooooah, that was cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hngh? What? Who said that?\" Naruto questioned, head turning side to side, propping himself up slightly on his elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, Boss! It was me! Down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his attention down to his belly where a familiar face was grinning up at him, a large gap visible among the pearly whites. Naruto smiled back, recognizing his friend and \"rival\" Konohamaru immediately. \"Hey Konohamaru! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see you! I heard you were back in the village from your mission and everyone was saying you got big but I didn't know you got THIS big! This is awesome!\" Konohamaru said excitedly, clearly in awe of the two story tall fox ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehe...yeah, it is, huh?\" Naruto said, rubbing his finger under his nose. The chuckle made his stomach vibrate slightly, Konohamaru giggling as he moved from foot to foot. \"How did you even get in here? Kakashi-sensei is supposed to be keeping a watch on this clearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru winked and held his hands together. \"Who do you think you're talking to?! I'm a world class ninja! I just sneaked by him without him even noticing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I can't believe Kakashi-sensei is so bad at this!\" Naruto pouted, outraged by his teacher's neglect. Of course, what neither boy knew was that Kakashi was quite aware of Konohamaru's presence...but with how down Naruto had looked before he fell asleep and how dingy his living quarters were at the moment, he figured Naruto could do with a friendly face. \"Anyway, whatever, it's great to see you again! What have you been up to lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Naruto listened as Konohamaru regaled him with tales of his exploits around the village, his time with Udon and Moegi, and his training. Naruto listened with a smile, nodding, laughing, and interjecting at various points with advice for the ninja in training. It was just like old times; it didn't matter to Konohamaru if Naruto was huge and if a little kid was fine with it, what excuse did anyone else have? It helped bolster Naruto's confidence once again that he was going to be fine no matter what happened and no matter how big he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal seemed to quiver slightly on his stomach, unnoticed by either Konohamaru or Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you even feel me on here, Boss?\" Konohamaru asked, getting to his feet and kicking his sandals off, letting his bare feet touch the warm, living ground that was Naruto's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda...but you feel really light. Even Kakashi-sensei didn't feel very heavy. Heh, it was actually kind of funny, watching him stumble around. He tickled a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru got a somewhat wicked grin on his face as he said, \"Oh, you're ticklish huh? Like do you feel...this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and pressed his palms against Naruto's peach skin, his fingers wriggling against the flesh, the tips tickling trails across the plain. Naruto snorted, loud enough to scatter birds from the trees into the morning light, cawing and whistling in alarm, the snort pealing out into a cacophony of obnoxious, childish laughter, Naruto's hands immediately rising to try and stop Konohamaru but pausing, not wanting to hurt his little friend. \"K-K-Konoha-ha-hahahahahahahahaha-hamaru! St-Stoooooop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru giggled himself as he was knocked onto his back by the force of the undulations of Naruto's flat stomach, rolling backwards, then to the side, then forward again, his scarf trailing out behind him and getting tangled slightly among his arms and legs. Naruto quieted down slowly as Konohamaru braced himself, laying still, the ups and downs of Naruto's receding laughter making Konohamaru feel like he was on a boat. He flipped over onto his front and slowly crawled over to the central point of his seal and what was the most ticklish spot, Konohamaru figured, on his giant friend's belly: the navel. He stretched out his fingers and grinned at Naruto who was shaking his head, panting slightly. \"Don't you dare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's fingers twitched, getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it Konohamaru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was in vain. Konohamaru viciously began to tickle around and within the small hole on Naruto's stomach, unleashing fresh waves of loud, boisterous laughter, Naruto's legs kicking up into the air and slamming back down to the forest floor, smashing deep footprints into the soft earth, again and again and again. The noise was shockingly loud, rattling the ears of anyone within a mile of the giant boy, the ground splitting and shaking underneath the power of his casual stomps. Konohamaru yelped as he was suddenly launched into the air by a particularly harsh burst of laughter, Naruto catching him lightly on his palm, lowering him back down to his chest. \"Enough...enough...you got me...you win...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo!\" Konohamaru shouted, throwing his arms into the air! \"I did it! I beat the Giant Boss! What do I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could answer, a loud cough was heard to the side of Naruto's body. Both boys looked down and saw Kakashi, with his arms folded, looking annoyed. Konohamaru shifted his eyes left and right, before throwing a smoke bomb down and stumbling away through the trees, his scarf almost getting tangled int he branches as he did so. Kakashi sighed as Naruto smiled sheepishly at him. \"Sorry about that Kakashi-sensei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I'm sure you...needed that.\" Kakashi said, wondering, as he looked around at the devastation wrecked on the clearing just from Naruto's laughter induced squirming, if he had made a mistake in letting Konohamaru see Naruto. Then again...that infectious, sunny smile was on Naruto's face again so...Kakashi shook his head again and continued. \"Well, how about we get you to your new living quarters then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, good.\" Naruto said, wincing as his back popped as he sat up, grumbling. \"Sleeping on the ground was not working for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hokage managed to send out for some appropriately sized clothing and furniture for you but it's not like it's ideal.\" Kakashi warned. \"This is all rather short notice and a bit too close to the Chunin Exams for much more to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take what I can get.\" Naruto said, stretching, more pops and cracks coming from his body. He slowly got to his feet and put his hands on his hips, standing up on his tip toes, trying to see over the canopies of the trees...which he wasn't QUITE able to do...yet. \"So where is this new warehouse...house supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the outskirts of the village.\" Kakashi called up. \"It used to store raw materials for construction but hasn't been in use for a few years. We got lucky with that. Your clothes are waiting for you there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully it covers more than this...\" Naruto said, tugging slightly at his threadbare coverings, almost pulling them apart by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does...but not much more. Remember, it's short notice.\" Kakashi explained. \"Anyway, that's all the information I have so why don't we go and see for ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" Naruto said, nodding and striding confidently back out of the clearing and towards the village.</span></div></div>",

You have been with me for quite a bit.\" He asked curiously and concerned for his team's readiness to take it, Kakashi thought about the question, well it is true that he is neglecting the giant knucklehead's other teammates and their training due to the situation with Naruto and his growth spurts, but since the seal is in place, he trusts that Naruto won't tamper with the seal, but he's also concerned that he might and something might happen, not to mention that the mysterious third party responsible for making Naruto grow again might still be out there...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto sighed as he watched the sunrise from the roof of Tazuna's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Wave were calling them all heroes. And sure, Naruto was excited; he was <i>thrilled</i>, but he kept thinking about Haku, and that such a good person had <i>died</i>. Maybe, if they hadn't been enemies, they could have been friends.  Good ones, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto leaned back, wincing as his back and knees popped. If Haku wasn't enough to get him down for long, using the fox's chakra had hit him pretty hard.  Ever since the fight two days ago, it seemed like any time he sat still for more than a few minutes every bone in his body would pop when he started moving again. Not just little pops, either, more like something's pulling out on your finger till it <i>hurts</i> kinds of pops.  He'd woken up really sore both mornings, and it seemed like the pain was making him a bit clumsy; he'd stubbed his toes three times yesterday, and he kept knocking things over when he was reaching for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi didn't seem worried about that part; he'd just muttered something about 'teenagers' and gone back to his porn. What Kakashi (and Naruto!) was worried about was the seal. Ever since the fight with Haku, the Kyuubi's seal had remained completely visible on Naruto's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, Naruto puffed his cheeks and gave his belly an angry poke. His stomach rumbled in response; almost like it was angry right back, but Naruto knew that wasn't the case.  The last difference he'd noticed since the fight (that he also hadn't really mentioned) was that for the last two days his stomach had felt...weird. It was like he was stuffed full and starving at the same time.  He didn't know what it meant, but he figured he'd tell Kakashi about it if it didn't go away by the time his team got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Naruto winced and pitched forward, grabbing his right foot. He bit his lip hard enough that he tasted metal, groaning as the pressure came back in his toes, only stronger than it had ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his seal-space, Kyuubi hummed to himself as he shaped his chakra along the pipes around him.  Idly, eyes closed, Kyuubi flexed his paws, claws popping in and out of his toes as he wiggled them back and forth while he gave his chakra a push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little piggy went to market...\" He grunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>POP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared wide-eyed at his foot as suddenly, his big toe wiggled, <i>popped</i>, and...grew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing at a slight remaining ache, Naruto quickly brought his feet together, heels touching the roof. His mouth dropped open. The big toe on his right foot had become a <i>big</i> toe; the knuckle on it was almost even with the <i>tip</i> of the same toe on his left foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi laughed darkly as he felt the chakra moving, the bars of his cage warming up. He'd have to watch that, but the more often he did this the easier it was getting; he'd been at it for days now, and it would only get easier from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These,\" grunt, \"little piggies stayed <i>home</i>....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>POP, pop pop pop!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, Naruto watched as his toes wriggled, snapped, and <i>grew</i>.  With a loud pop, the big toe on his left foot shot out to match the right. Naruto grimaced, rubbing the soles of his feet as he broke out in a light sweat.  It felt like he had a cramp along the length of his whole foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi heard the warning hiss from the paper seal. One last push, and he'd have to take a break. Sweating a bit himself, Kyuubi reached with his hand paws and grabbed his own feet, and focused on his chakra. He tugged hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the piggies...aren't such <i>little</i> piggies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNAP, POP, POP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gasped as his whole right FOOT jumped, as the toes on his left popped out to bigger sizes.  Just as the toes were getting level, his right foot streeetched out, moving the tips of his toes out of reach again.  He watched, not surprised, as the left quickly popped out to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat on the roof for some time, waiting to see if anything else was going to happen. After a few quiet minutes, he gingerly rose to his feet and started walking off of the roof.  He stumbled a bit, unused to his own feet, but eventually made it back to his room. At least the pain had mostly disappeared after a while, he hadn't really even felt his feet growing at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was asleep, snoring. Most of his friends wouldn't believe that Sasuke snored, but he did. He also drooled, and kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that for the moment, Naruto sat down next to his sandals and took stock. Slowly, he slid his foot into the sandal. By the time he got his heel into the back, his toes were completely over the fronts.  The whole thing felt a bit tight, but it fit...kinda.  Still, Naruto had bought those sandals before the mission, and they'd been slightly <i>big</i> on his feet last week...and ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head. Stomach problems, clumsiness, and now his sandals didn't fit. And whatever happened on the roof wasn't normal. He grimaced, and decided to pretend nothing was wrong for now. He couldn't figure out how to bring it up now without Sasuke or Sakura finding out about the fox, and he wasn't ready for that yet. It'd be fine; he'd tell Kakashi when they got home. His feet weren't big enough that his team would notice, so long as he didn't trip a lot or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto proceeded to dress for the day, planning on hiding the problem with his feet. With that obvious difference, he never noticed that you could see a visible tan line on his ankles where his pants usually rested...about an inch below where they rested now.  Or how the sleeves of his jacket weren't baggy or over-long on his arms anymore, but fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did notice that he'd have to watch his step, as he almost fell down the stairs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the seal, Kyuubi relaxed...and waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time that Team Seven had made its way back to Konoha, Naruto and the Fox were both in bad moods, though for almost the opposite reasons. Naruto ruffled himself a bit as his orange jacket rubbed at his skin. Normally he'd wear a t-shirt underneath, but he'd had to give that up halfway home; the black shirt he'd brought with him was new, but he'd bought it slightly tight at a discount store, and it seemed the cheap cotton had shrunk after all the dunkings he got in Wave. The last time he'd put it on it felt like it was trying to choke his neck! And since his baggy jacket seemed a bit...less baggy than he expected in places the rougher fabric kept irritating his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the seal, Kyuubi stuck his thumb in his mouth and blew; a rubbery stretching sound echoed out from his cage, and he watched with his extremely sensitive eyes as the walls of his chamber shifted outward a few inches.  Outside his cage, the paper seal continued to hiss and spit a bit, pushing back on his chakra. Snarling, Kyuubi stopped with his project for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was taking <i>forever</i>! It wasn't fair that seals could take him from thousands of feet tall and shrink him into a dozen-plus-whatever inch baby in seconds, and the best he'd managed in <i>days</i> was what...two inches? Maybe a bit more? And when he'd tested going faster with the brat's feet, he'd almost tripped the seal! If he did something to upset the blasted thing it'd force all of the chakra feeders he'd been sending into his jailor's body back into the cage and he'd have to start over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. Getting angry made his chakra act up, and that made the seal <i>mad</i>. He'd have to think about this logically. The seal didn't like for him to cause Naruto pain, even if the pain was a side effect of...loosely defined 'help.' Some, maybe all of the pain was currently coming from him working <i>against</i> the kid's normal chakra flow and forcing changes where he wanted. He was very limited in how much chakra he could use because the coils he'd managed to tap were <i>tiny</i>, but he'd done that on purpose because he wasn't sure how much the seal would fight him and wanted to keep the flow lower at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, step one, work on a 'lighter' touch with the chakra, maybe try to feel out how the body grew naturally and change his energy to mimic how that looked. Maybe it'd be easier if he did things that the kid wanted to happen at the time; he'd keep an ear to the ground. As for the flow, as the boy grew so would the coils...but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi eyed the pipes leaving his chamber speculatively. Several of the smaller pipes now crackled with red energy, pumping his nutrient-enriched chakra and extending his awareness through the body. But not all pipes were equal, and Kyuubi grinned as he saw a few <b>big</b> ones.  Next time the brat called his chakra, he was getting a few of those!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside the seal, Naruto let out a whoop as Team Seven got back into Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's all have Ramen to celebrate!\" He cheered. Kakashi looked bored a life, so no change, Sakura looked a bit interested (SCORE) and Sasuke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. I've looked at you enough this month, loser.\" Sasuke turned and prepared to stalk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Naruto shot out a hand and grabbed the jerk's shirt, yanking him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke tensed, starting to resist, but he apparently didn't gauge Naruto's strength accurately as he found himself sliding along the ground until the two were close enough to touch noses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared into Sasuke's eyes, and...wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paused, rant forgotten, and slowly brought his hand up onto Sasuke's head. Sasuke was too distracted for a moment, both by how strong the loser's grip was and by how weirdly soon he ran into the guy's toes, to move.  Naruto slid his hand off of Sasuke's head and brought it over to his own. He wasn't hitting air, in fact he'd rubbed his scalp a little!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"  Naruto hopped back (he stumbled a little) and pointed at Sasuke. \"In your FACE! We're the same height now, you can't call me midget or shrimp or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never called you those things!\" Sasuke shouted, eye twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was me.\" Kakashi raised a hand, not looking up from his porn as he wandered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Naruto puffed his chest a bit. \"Take me seriously! We're a team, and we should eat together! To Ichiraku!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke and Sakura looked at the Naruto-shaped dust cloud for a moment, before Sakura shrugged and started to follow a trail of shoved and irritated-looking people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sasuke,\" she called as she walked, \"you know he'll just bother us more tomorrow if we don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they caught up, Naruto was sitting at a booth and his first bowl was almost ready.  The blond kicked his feet back and forth as he perched, eyeing the food like a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both teammates got ready to order, their jaws dropped as Ayame placed a bowl full of ramen in front of Naruto and he tilted it back and swallowed the whole thing in one go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame looked a bit shocked, too, but turned without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Naruto for you,\" she called as she whipped up a second bowl. \"He must have missed our ramen; I don't know where he puts it all though! I remember once when he was six he didn't come here for almost three weeks, and when he did show up he finished his first bowl in two gulps. I suppose he <i>has</i> grown a little, since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto loudly protested that he was <i>too</i> growing, and that 'Ayame is mean', Sasuke and Sakura both managed to slowly start eating their own bowls, both instinctively guarding them with their arms from the Naruto-monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they nursed their single bowls, Naruto downed a further two in one gulp each before even slowing down. Even Ayame looked a bit disturbed as he finished bowl 30; she glanced over at the \"Most Raman Eaten: 20 bowls! (Naruto Uzumaki)\" sign and started looking for a marker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after bowl 36, Naruto leaned back and sighed happily, stretching out his arms and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>pop pop pop</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto gingerly climbed out of his new bed, wincing with worry, only to sigh in  relief when no <i>popping</i> noises came from his joints, and he felt no soreness. It had been a few weeks since he returned to the village, and since then he'd had to get used to some...changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the wall in his new room, Naruto took care of step two of his new morning routine and hopped on a medical scale to check his height and weight.  Five feet six inches tall and one hundred seventy pounds.  No change in two days, but he'd still grown a full head taller and almost doubled in weight since the last time his friends saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head to clear his nerves, Naruto tipped up his chin and pointed at his reflection in the mirror and pasted on a feral grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this!  They're letting you out today and you'll show the <i>whole world</i> what you can do!  Your friends will all be <i>sooo</i> jealous, 'cause they all know how awesome you were at <i>half</i> this size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave a quick fist pump, thinking he looked like a boss in his new pink and green frog print pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large and in <i>charge</i>, 'tebayo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more pumped up, Naruto thought he might be up to meeting his friends again after all; the Chuunin Exams won't know what hit them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few weeks had been bad, and Naruto missed his team. He missed going outside.  The day after he got back in the village, Kakashi-sensei took him to a special room under the Hokage Tower to have his seal checked.  Old Man Hokage promised they'd take good care of him, and that they'd even sent for <i>more</i> help from far away, just in case, but that whoever that was wouldn't be there for almost a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first day, everything changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome weirdo Hyuuga was brought in with an ink brush and he stared at Naruto with his creepy eyes for a bit. Then he said that his seal was visible because some of the Kyuubi's chakra had been pulled into it and gotten stuck.  Naruto didn't really get how that was a thing, but they guy was supposed to be an expert, and could look at him inside-out, so he asked what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking it out with the Hokage, Hyuuga-moron drew a little on his own hands and fingertips, and then started poking around Naruto's seal. He definitely did <i>something</i>, because the next thing Naruto knew he could swear he heard deep rumbling laughter as his whole body lit up in red and the \"expert\" was blown across the room and smacked into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few seconds before Kakashi slapped some sort of \"shut that off!\" seal on him, but those seconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, Naruto pulled out his new outfit, specially made by the Akimichi clan at the Old Man's request, and slipped on his custom sandals.  He shook off the memory of his skin stretching, the blood throbbing in his veins as his wiry muscles pulled tight and started flexing, popping out on his frame.  The short pain in his feet right before his tight sandals <i>exploded</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door. As Naruto stood, he heard his sensei through the door, saying something about \"cover story,\" and \"keep calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened.  Naruto stared at his team. His team (except Kakashi) stared at a <i>lot</i> more Naruto than they were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Naruto rubbed his hair sheepishly.  \"Hi guys. Ready to kick butt in the exams...'tebayo? Eheh..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of Team Seven was quiet long enough for Naruto to start feeling uncomfortable again. He shifted his weight a bit as Sakura slowly walked towards him, moving her gaze from his chest, which was nearly eye level to her, down his legs to his feet, and slowly back up until her head was tilted up to look at his face. It was weird. Kakashi-Sensei was still taller, but his team-mates looked kinda...<i>little</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Kakashi called out cheerily as he clapped his hands once, \"now that my cute little gennin are all together again-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch,\" Sasuke scoffed, turning from Naruto (who was pretty sure Sasuke had been looking him up and down, too) to look at Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the moron 'finished the totally normal growth spurt he started a bit before Wave',\" Sasuke stated in a tone mockingly similar to Kakashi's voice. \"What <i>really</i> happened, Uzumaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Naruto offered, blinking as Sakura lifted one of his arms so she could press her hand against his; the tips of her fingers touched the bottoms of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chakra-related accident!\" Kakashi offered, beaming, as he casually moved across the room and picked up Sakura, who had moved on to grabbing Naruto's arm for balance and quite easily resting her whole foot on top of Naruto's between his toes and his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's enough non-consensual groping from you, Sakura!\" Sensei continued, setting her back down next to Sasuke. \"Let's keep those crazy teen hormones in check, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakshi!\" Sakura screamed, blushing.  \"It's not like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does look really different.\" Sasuke observed casually, but he looked sort of interested. \"How big <i>is</i> he, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi shrugged his shoulders as he gestured the team outside. Naruto didn't need to be told twice, and easily caught up with his team.  They wouldn't have far to walk, with Naruto being moved pretty much into the Hokage Tower for quick access and testing. Still, the second he was completely outside, Naruto sighed with relief, smiling up at the clear blue sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger than you, smaller than me.\" Kakashi answered simply, giving Naruto's hair a ruffle. \"Just like almost everybody taking the exams with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto batted Kakashi's hand off of his hair, but he grinned a bit, too. He was glad sensei wasn't making a huge deal out of this; Kakashi was too laid back for that, anyway, but it still felt nice. He didn't even really mind getting his hair ruffled; it showed Kakashi <i>was</i> still bigger, and that made him feel a bit less like he'd outgrown his whole life.  He couldn't help blushing a bit as he saw his team-mates keep sending him covert, curious glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the new clothes?\" Sasuke asked, turning around at the front of the group and walking backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're from Choji's family.\" Naruto answered, patting his shirt self-consciously and eyeing Sasuke a bit jealously. Last time he'd tried walking backwards, he'd tripped over his own feet and crushed his new end table into kindling. It had not been replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look pretty good,\" Sakura offered, smiling. \"Do they have a style you like better? I mean, there's still plenty of clothes in regular shops that you could wear, no problem; you're not <i>that</i> tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled, glad that his friends seemed to be wrapping their minds around things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some Akimichi clothing is designed to grow with the wearer,\" Kakashi piped in. \"They use it with their techniques. It's sort of like how, if you're careful, you can fit a regular condom over a baseball bat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick a better metaphor!\" Sakura screamed, as everyone but Kakashi turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi just hummed innocently. Naruto took back every nice thing he'd ever thought about the man, ever; he'd made things awkward again on purpose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, Sakura, I thought that was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Seven paused in their walk and looked down a side street, where Kiba, Shino, and Hinata were approaching. Hinata seemed to suddenly stop, like she'd hit a wall, and stared ahead with a stunned look on her face. Shino immediately paused as well, looking down at his frozen team-mate. Kiba apparently hadn't noticed yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously,\" Kiba continued, rotating his shoulders, \"that scream almost sounds like a dog whis- Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Inuzuka boy turned, and slowly waved a hand in front of Hinata's face. Getting no response, he scratched his head and turned to face forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys, do you know what might be...up....with....up?\" He trailed off, finally getting a good look at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, mutt face.\" Naruto offered, giving a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The hell.\"  Kiba offered, walking slowly up to his old classmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru, perched on Kiba's head, sat up a bit so he could look Naruto in the eye and gave a happy bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally normal growth spurt,\" Sakura, Sasuke, and Kakashi all droned out the answer at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Kiba both twitched. Shino started waving his hand in front of Hinata's face, and snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever happened, can I have some?\" Kiba asked, looking down with a whistle.  \"Seriously, you're like, supersized, <i>and</i> you have puppy feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what?\" Naruto asked, glancing down and flexing his toes. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hinata walking up, still looking a bit dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Akamaru,\" Kiba looked up, where his partner obligingly held up a paw.  \"Akamaru's tiny, but I picked him because he had big paws. It's how you can tell how big a dog is <i>going</i> to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His feet and hands <i>are</i> really big,\" Sakura offered, looking down at her own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This conversation is pointless.\" Shino offered, placing a hand on Hinata's shoulder and starting to lead her on toward the academy. \"Why? Because we can all observe Naruto's proportions ourselves, and adjust our tactics should we meet in the exam. Discussing it changes nothing, and could make us late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scrunched up his face, but shrugged and glared (up) into Naruto's eyes for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going, but don't think this changes anything. The bigger they are, the harder they fall!\" Kiba smirked. \"So don't even think about growing into those feet, loser; you'll just make things worse for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Naruto shouted, pointing at Kiba (who was <i>also</i> walking backwards, ugh!) \"Well, if I fall, I'm gonna fall on <i>you</i>! Yeah! How'd you like that, dog-boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Naruto thought smugly, he was a genius at witty banter! Don't mess with the master!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just jealous!\" Sakura shouted, pulling down on her eyelid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn.\" Sasuke offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Kakashi snapped out his orange book and started reading, \"I'm sure Kiba-chan knows what they say about big feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stumbled a bit, staring at Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed and started sputtering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto reached up (slightly) and smacked Kakashi-jerk's head, before stomping toward the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dumb sensei made it weird again!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Naruto dealt with annoying pervy teachers and freaked-out friends, Kurama had troubles of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the depths of his cage, the mighty Kyuubi sighed, and scowled.  His tails thrashed angrily around, the only limbs that he could move. Wrapped tightly around him like a cocoon was giant glowing tree.  With a roar of frustration, he flexed his entire body. Muscles that hadn't even existed before that moment popped out with the strain and he thrashed wildly in his newest, even tighter prison. The branches tying him up <i>creaked</i> under the strain, but held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, Kurama let his head sink down, and decided to rest a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't too proud to admit his own mistakes; he'd overplayed his hand. But...it had been so intoxicating! The complete freedom to push through the seal, filling the brat's entire body, the feeling like he was slipping into a tight, but <i>flexible</i> suit, that unlike this ungodly seal with every push he could feel the body <i>stretch</i> to accommodate him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis moment of triumph was short. A shock, like a thousand insect stings had struck him after what must have only been a few seconds, and he'd been forced back into the cage. He'd slammed at the bars as the paper seal lit like fire; he'd <i>burned</i> with the backlash as he hit his cage again, and again, until even the indestructible metal of his prison had started to creak and groan.  Suddenly, a sapling had burst from the floor of his prison, and bound him tight. He'd snarled, he'd screamed, and he'd cursed.  But his bindings would not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was outmatched.  To get at the boy, he'd have to get past not one, but two barriers! The seal was - to him at least - unbreakable, and while this <i>tree</i> was new, it was absolutely saturated with sage chakra. While Kurama's chakra was vast, the chakra of the world itself was near-infinite, and it made things so <i>durable</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyuubi paused, even his tails still.  Slowly, his mouth formed into a grin. He chuckled, slowly he laughed. The branches dug into his ribs a bit, but he didn't care! Oh, those fools; this was <i>perfect</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been learning, after all. The whole time, as that brat tripped over his own toes trying to adapt, Kyuubi had been studying everywhere that his chakra could go; and eventually he could send his chakra anywhere.  One of the sad truths he'd had to accept was that his host was made of meat. No matter how much his chakra could help, there was a limit to how much stress, how much weight muscle and bone could bear before his 'gift' would have simply killed the boy. His dreams of returning to his former towering glory, meat suit or not, had died a sad death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nature chakra turned muscle into cables, bone to steel, skin into armor.  And to stop his meddling, those foolish little monkeys had stuck a tap for the stuff <i>right into the seal with him</i>. All he had to do was work out how to turn it to his purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi relaxed further in the prison as he stopped the pointless struggle and forced himself to really think. The seal, and the tree, were perfect prisons. They were designed to stop a biju cold.  And he could not find a single weakness in them on that front.  Looking down, Kurama considered his (very much reduced) ramen ocean, and got an idea.  He idly flexed his arm, watching as muscles that he'd only made up moments ago bunched up, and then relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was biju. He was sentient chakra, and bound by those rules. His body was a shell, a hollow construct molded to his will.  And as he was, he was powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kurama dipped a tail down into the ramen, and winced as he felt the perfect blend of his chakra with real matter soak up into his body.  As the floor drained down to the stone, Kurama felt himself sagging against the tree as he gained mass, became more real and solid than he'd ever been before. Focusing inward, he directed the material based on what he'd learned from Naruto's body. There was a brief, awkward moment when he realized he'd actually be a <i>he</i>, and had to spend some time shuffling his hips to, er, make room. Eventually, he turned his gaze down at the branch crossing his chest...and bit into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing, grimacing at the horrible taste, Kurama hoped his plan would work. Unlike that fiasco with those two idiot-warriors long ago, he should have a real, working stomach now. So instead of being held forever, the tree <i>should</i> be digested.  Gulping, Kurama lowered his head and took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the taste changed. It wasn't stems and leaves. It was blood, it was meat. It was everything delicious, it was energy, it was life! It was better than he could have hoped; nature chakra contained in itself everything needed for life. If he could only harness this power, he may not be free, but he would never be fully contained ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dark space created by the seal, a golden glow began to form on Kurama's navel, in a weird copy of the seal on Naruto's stomach. Golden fire began to flow outward, spreading in thick lines across Kurama's new, solid body. The sage tree creaked, and groaned. Kurama had only chewed through a third of the branches before the rest simply snapped, unable to contain him any longer. Kurama looked down, glancing at his paw next to a print he'd left in the bark from his earlier struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis paw was <i>bigger</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed, bending down and tearing into the tree, ripping out chunks with his teeth, tails wagging madly behind him. Why not, after all? Why should Naruto have all the fun? With a contemptuous flick of his tail, a pulse of golden energy rushed out from his body, slamming into the walls outside his prison. He watched, grinning, as the walls made a loud grinding sound and slid back a few inches.  He wondered if the brat would notice a growth spurt that small; it wasn't much compared to what he'd done before.  Still, fair warning! And if Kurama was getting bigger too, he'd need a lot more space than he thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal space filled with golden light, dark laughter, and the sound of chewing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was weird; he'd always wanted to stand out and get some attention, but if <i>one more</i> of his classmates grabbed onto him, did that 'hand from their head to his chest' thing, or just asked 'dude...what have you been <i>eating</i>?' he was planning to go full hermit for a few years. Just until everyone caught back up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thunk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced, cursing a bit under his breath as his knees banged under the table. Fine then, he'd just stretch his legs out and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thunk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and his toes just hit the back of the next row, because <i>of course they did</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't even the biggest guy in the room! Not even close, really; he seemed to be about level with most of the test takers; teams in their mid-teens with a few years of mission experience. There were large, muscular and/or hairy men (and women) in the room! Naruto was certain now that these were desks from a much younger class. Like, six-year-olds or something. The examiner must be screwing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched, impressed and a bit jealous as Hinata daintily sank down into the seat next to his. Sure, she seemed a bit tense, but at last she fit into the furniture. Naruto cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ne, Hinata-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't look!\" The girl blurted out loudly, staring forward with a panicked expression. She quickly went bright red as the other genin in the room all turned and stared at their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Naruto scratched his head, confused. \"That's good, Hinata! Way to not do that, whatever it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe offered her a grin and a thumbs up, and wondered if he should start brushing his teeth with better soap like that green eyebrow kid must. Something industrial, like the stuff you can steal to make your own cherry bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata seemed to calm down by the time the test started, just in time for Naruto to start freaking the hell out.  He couldn't figure out  a single question!  Half of them looked like obscure history trivia, and the rest were math!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped as he tried to read an equation slowly, but the more nervous he got the less of it he could keep straight in his head and the numbers all started swirling around each other and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thunk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto froze, all thought leaving his head as he felt his knees whack against the table again; he swore he hadn't moved, and his toes were still jammed up at the front! Slowly, trying not to be accused of cheating, Naruto tried to quietly move his chair back a bit. As he did, he noticed something...weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like getting over a bad cold and suddenly having your nose open back up, or your ears pop. Naruto was surrounded by...something.  The whole room was buzzing with energy, flowing around like water and floating off of the other ninja like steam. There also seemed to be a small tornado coming out of his belly-button.  Naruto ignored that last bit for a moment, because the whatever-it-was coming off of the people had <i>feelings</i> attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the genin were freaking out just like him; some felt sneaky and confident, and some felt...like he felt when he was pulling a really good prank. Those guys were spread through the room, and that Ibiki guy felt the same way!  Naruto narrowed his eyes, wondering if he was getting tricked somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na...Naruto,\" Hinata whispered quietly, nudging her paper toward him. \"You can copy off of me if...if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata felt...Naruto wasn't sure. It was nice, but scary and embarrassing and warm and a little queasy. Naruto thought about saying no, but Hinata really <i>felt</i> like she wanted to help him; like taking the help would make her happy, even if it put her at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto copied exactly one question from her sheet, and she <i>did</i> feel happy about it. Of course, then their jerk proctor had to ruin it by saying it was all for nothing! All he'd needed to pass the stupid test was to have enough balls not to cut and run at the first threat of failure! Like that was a problem; he might not have much brains, but he had balls to spare. Naruto didn't even get the point for the question he'd copied, since he got the answer right but was busted for cheating. He was still brooding about it long after he'd squeezed out of the testing table and loped along with the crowd to the second quiz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shock when a kunai got lobbed at his face...and bounced off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Naruto shouted, more out of reflex as he picked up the knife. He glared at the proctor lady; Anko-something. \"Don't throw stuff! Knives are <i>sharp</i>-tebayo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko-something did not look impressed when she rushed up to him and yanked the kunai out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not gonna bleed properly, you'd better pay attention, or I'll find something that <i>works</i>.\" She hissed at him, frowning down at the kunai; it looked slightly chipped, like it had been chucked at a rock a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto did his best to pay attention, but all the new feelings floating around everywhere were super distracting. Sand-ninja-redhead who felt like angry-hunger-manic-<i>lonely</i>, Hyuuga-jerk who was bitter-smug-angry, Grass-lady who felt like <i>nothing</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his team dragged him off to their starting gate, Naruto hoped they knew the rules and stuff, because he had <i>no</i> idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt an enemy ninja try and jump him while he was peeing (who does that?!), he realized his new sense would be super-handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he easily lifted the ninja bodily off the ground with one arm, his hand around the jerk's neck, he realized he'd gotten a lot stronger than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when that ninja pulled a hidden sword and then <i>broke</i> that sword on Naruto's arm, Naruto decided to forgive the Kyuubi for turning him into a giant, if these were the side-effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds after knocking the enemy ninja out cold, Naruto's stomach let out a ridiculous growl, he felt his whole body give a shiver, and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Uuuuuurp</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto coughed awkwardly and waved his hand in front of his face. Seriously, why did his burp smell like leaves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping then enemy's entire fist in one hand, Naruto casually dragged him through the brush as he made his way back to his team.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opening one eye, he looked down the vast landscape that was his torso at his almost spherical gut.  A ripple passed through his fur, spreading from his belly-button outward, and he heard an odd creaking sound from his navel.  The whole thing pretty much screamed '<i>Warning: Contents Under Pressure</i>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>HIC</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive paw shot up to cover his mouth as he gave a heavy gulp, and slowly moved down to rub along his giant belly as the massive fox winced at the sensation coming from his stomach.

The tree had kept trying to grow back until he got down under the root and found a bit of wood under the main trunk with a glowing green seal on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>HIC</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thunk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyuubi grumbled halfheartedly as he felt his feet bump against the edge of his cage. Moving his one-eyed gaze to the increasingly tiny-looking paper seal, he started rolling from side to side, hoping to get his body upright again.  His stomach grumbled right back, and seemed to bloat up even <i>larger</i>. Giving up, the growing fox-god took a moment to thank the heavens nobody could see him looking so ridiculous, and leaned backward. Butt in the air, he used four tails to brace the weight of his gut and waved the last five at the cage. A pulse of golden chakra blasted out, filling the chamber, and the rumbling in his belly was shortly drowned out by the groaning of stone sliding over stone and the odd shrieking sound made by growing metal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, bad news: The tree-thing was still trying to grow inside him, and this constant <i>pressure</i> was reeeealy uncomfortable! He'd have to make sure - <b>HIC</b> - that the brat wasn't suffering like this; might upset the seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news: Kyuubi sighed as the cage, the floor, and the outer chamber walls all expanded around him. The nature chakra did a real number on him; whatever he'd turned into, his chakra wasn't poisonous anymore, and the seal didn't seem to care how much he pushed out anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter news: The tree was definitely digesting. Kyuubi was glad; it probably wouldn't keep stretching him out after it was gone, but he didn't want to spend the rest of his existence growing inside a cage that he had to spend all his time stretching to fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thunk</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a few more thousand feet wouldn't hurt; really, it was only fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stumbled a bit as he dragged his prisoner along. Sure, the guy wasn't <i>heavy</i> or anything (at least to him), but having extra weight on one side really threw off your balance. Plus, his sandals seemed to have shifted on his feet during the fight. He'd have to adjust them, but if weird enemy ninja were going to attack while he was trying to <i>pee</i>, they definitely wouldn't give him time to retie his shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid - <b>HIC</b> - ninja-tebayo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to his friends, he saw Sasuke lounging over two other tied-up ninja like a boss, and Sakura rummaging through their stuff.  Both turned as Naruto's stomach gave off a loud grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke shot him a smirk that seemed to falter a bit as he saw Naruto's dragged prisoner, but he just snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, took you long enough, Dobe. What, can't handle one measly - <i>Did you get taller?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paused, dropped the last guy on his friends (there were some pitiful groaning noises) and sat down to pry off his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He asked. \"Why would you think that? I mean, I think I'd notice, right? My clothes still fit just fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't those Akimichi clothes?\" Sakura asked, hopping over and roughly tying up the third enemy.  \"They're made to grow, right? Like in Kakashi's...um...metaphor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three all turned a bit green, remembering their weirdo teacher's commentary.  Naruto felt his whole body shiver; geez, he didn't need that reminder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your sandals aren't.\" Sasuke added, glancing at Naruto's feet.  There were red lines where the sandal straps met skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Naruto asked, jamming his sandals back on roughly, and <i>not</i> wincing because his feet were <i>not</i> bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up.\" Sasuke ordered. Sakura nodded along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on guys, <i>again</i>?\" Naruto huffed as he hopped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't slouch!\" Sakura shouted, pointing at his hunched back accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just did this-tebayo!\" Naruto exclaimed, standing up straight (he was gonna do that anyway!) and letting Sasuke do the head-to-chest thing <i>again</i>. \"I get it, I'm <i>big</i>, you guys shouldn't freak out just because you think - <b>UUUUUURP</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Creak   Snap   Pop</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced as he <i>saw</i> Sasuke seem to just...<i>shrink</i>, and felt his sandals (okay, so they <i>were</i> too tight) snap off of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody said anything for a minute; Naruto just stood there trying to stay very, <i>very</i> calm, while Sakura stared wide-eyed and Sasuke became the first of his friends to try the head-to-<i>ribs</i> thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Sakura broke the silence, asking a question that Naruto couldn't answer, and really didn't want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, are...are you still growing?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hurry - <b>HIC</b> - up!\" Naruto called back at his friends as he pushed his way-too-long legs for every extra bit of speed they could give him.  Behind and above him, his friends were rushing to keep up like champs, tree-hopping as fast as they could.  Naruto would be up there himself if he thought he could trust his balance and knew his own weight, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - SNAP -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly shook his head and kept running, ducking slightly as he ran under some lower branches.  He couldn't trust his eyes right now; he could have sworn that branch was high enough to run under and it <i>would</i> have been if he were, like, a foot shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, about ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a weird day, but Naruto thought the whole 'giant' thing had been fixed! He hadn't grown at all since that creepy-eyed guy had smacked him on the stomach, and Hokage-jiji said it was safe now, so he could join his friends in the exams, and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>HIC</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned as he tasted bitter leaves, and felt that odd electric tingle shoot from his stomach out to the tips of his fingers and toes. He winced and shivered as he <i>felt</i> the fabric of his special clothing drag along his lengthening torso, watched the branches above him seem to suddenly <i>drop</i> a little, and quickly caught himself as he stumbled a bit, his larger foot landing a bit further ahead then he'd planned, throwing off his stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd woken up that morning a scary-tall twelve-year-old, and he was going to bed a freak. He had to be seven feet tall by now; every wave of...whatever that tingling stuff was hit his bones like a sledgehammer, he could <i>feel</i> them pushing out at his skin, pulling at his muscles, and then that weird almost relaxing feeling as everything else caught up and made room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth, Naruto focused his chakra, pushing it toward his gut to swirl around the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hold it in. Hold it in. Get to the tower. Hold it...hold it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so distracted he didn't even notice the snake until it had swallowed him. Scared, and cramped, and not sure what the <i>hell</i> had just happened, Naruto threw out his arms and grabbed onto whatever he could.  He was somewhere dark, and warm. The walls were smooth and wet, and through them he could feel a harder, rippling structure. He heard something gulp, loudly, and felt a wave of pressure forcing him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. Nope. Nope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging in, Naruto grabbed onto the walls <i>harder</i>, and dug his feet in, wishing he was still wearing sandals for the traction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole area started thrashing around, and he felt like whatever-this-was was also moving back the way he came. Another wave of pressure bore down on him, and Naruto felt himself slide along with it before he could strengthen his grip. His feet were starting to burn, like they were heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been swallowed! Naruto focused on the idea, and a brief image of a giant, scaly head flashed in his memory.  Did snakes even get that big?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned as another wave of pressure pushed him toward the creature's...he guessed stomach.  Probably stomach.  He couldn't get a good enough grip; the walls were slimy and he just wasn't strong enough. Sure, he was the world's biggest twelve-year-old, but compared to this giant tube of muscle his stretched-out twig arms weren't gonna cut it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought, Naruto's stomach made an odd, grumbling noise, and the pressure in his belly seemed to...stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! Not now!  Just when it would be <i>useful</i> to have giant-size super-power giving stuff in his stomach, it <i>goes away</i>?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate, Naruto reached for the source of the horrible buzzing energy, hoping for just a scrap, something to get him out of this mess...and the energy responded.  It flowed like water, smoother than his own chakra, however Naruto asked it.  No bone stretching, no stumbling, just...there.  It still seemed to bring a new sense of feelings with it, and Naruto could feel that the Snake that ate him was confused, and in some pain, and felt a bit sick. Strangely, the energy he was getting had feelings too; it felt curious, and...amused?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cried out as an even bigger wave of pressure slammed into him, forcing him to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he growled. \"You want tight? I'll give you tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't much for planning, or thinking ahead. Usually he just accepted situations as he found them and ran with it. So if that weird energy was listening to him now, then it was a tool he could use. Probably. Maybe. Anyway this snake-monster was going down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, not really sure what he was doing, Naruto tried making the energy...buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, Naruto felt his middle warm up, and felt an odd pressure moving against his skin. The pressure pushing down on him seemed to get easier to carry, and Naruto grunted as he slowly became able to straighten his back.  Encouraged, he pulled the buzzing feeling into his legs, and was soon able to straighten his knees. Naruto let the energy fill his body; his skin felt strangely tight on him, but he felt so strong!  Pushing out with his arms, he felt the snake start to <i>give</i> a bit under the pressure; had it really almost crushed him before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto needed a better grip. His finger-bones hummed and stretched, longer and thinner in proportion to his hands. They dug between the rippling walls and held tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to brace against the sliding pressure.  The floor slid under his feet as they creaked and popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get out. Holding on with his legs and one arm, Naruto wrapped one long-fingered hand around his other bicep and felt a small furnace under his skin. He grinned ferally as his large hand was forced open, the muscle pushing against his palm as hard as granite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever kind of snake it was, it exploded when it died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood, panting, in a quickly-clearing mist left over by the creature. In front of him, Sakura-chan was sobbing over Sasuke. The dark-haired boy was knocked out, a wicked black mark on the pale skin of his neck.  Naruto crossed the distance to them, and casually lifted his friend over his shoulder. Sakura looked up at him with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Naruto started walking toward the tower.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Less than a minute after Sakura took their third teammate inside, Iruka-Sensei ran out in a panic only to skid to a halt near Naruto's tree. Naruto took a moment to appreciate looking up at someone. Even if it wasn't by much. And he was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\" Iruka trailed off; he looked pretty shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally normal growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could't help laughing a bit, though he had a bit of trouble stopping.

(Naruto noted the weirdo's name for later.) \"Shouldn't you be with Sasuke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, screw that.\" Jiraiya waved his hand casually as he looked Naruto up...and up, and down. \"We have, um, bigger problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>HIC</b>\" Naruto offered. He felt his body shiver, and the grass rubbed his heels as they shifted across the ground.  He found himself looking Iruka in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot taking time to comment, Jiraiya popped an ink bottle and brush out of his sleeves and yanked up on Naruto's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Naruto offered, reaching over to fight off the stranger-danger taking place near his belly-button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself; get that giant paw you call a hand out my face, brat.\" The white-haired creep gave Naruto's hand a smack that he in <i>no way</i> felt and started scribbling free-hand on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto immediatly froze and did his best to ignore any tickles; he'd been warned a LOT by the Old Man about what happened when seals weren't done right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids these days...\" Jiraiya muttered as Naruto fought not to move. \"This would be a lot easier if you weren't so bumpy, brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do look a bit more...muscular, Naruto.\" Iruka offered. \"Is that new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's new.\" Kakashi offered, looking Naruto over for any other changes. \"Before, it looked like he was staying in proportion. This is different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto struggled not to squirm under the attention (SEALS, for the love of Kami, DON'T MOVE), but he felt his face heat up a bit. Hopefully none of his friends would get to the tower any time soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later.\" Jiraiya muttered, finishing what looked like a spiral shape. \"For now...ACTIVATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flinched as he felt his stomach burn as chakra blasted outward in every direction. For dozens of feet in every direction, plants shot out of the ground and burst into flowers.  Naruto suddenly gasped, as he fell back against the tree. His heart was beating like crazy!  He couldn't...breathe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\"  Iruka shouted, rushing forward and grabbing onto Naruto's arm as the scared, confused giant broke into a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His pulse is going crazy! What did you do?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would..oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting one moment, Jiraiya rushed forward and started drawing even faster than before, quick almost dangerously mess squiggles tearing into his previous work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto let out a choking sob as he felt his heart calm down, and darkness started to fade from his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked on in shock as Kakashi-sensei slammed Jiraiya into the ground with one arm, murder in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain 'oops'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya looked over at Naruto. The young giant could see an apology, and a great deal of regret in the old man's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid's too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Iruka's turn to start laughing strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain better.\" Kakashi offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know how much advanced math you know, kid,\" Jiraiya said, not even fighting to get up, \"but there's something called the square-cube law. Basically, human's were designed to live at a certain size, and all of our body symptoms work at that size. If we're a lot smaller or a lot bigger, it messes with that balance.  The kid is too big to live without at least a little of the energy that is making him grow.  I...didn't think about it, and I shut all of it off. He started dying. So I added a valve, to let a little bit of the Natural Chakra trickle in, to strengthen his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi let the old man up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr Creepy Old Guy?  I don't understand a lot of that stuff, but...for now, am I better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya offered Naruto another of those strange smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kid.

He was about to win. Naruto\u2019s shirt was torn apart, leaving the ninja\u2019s upper body exposed. The blond breathed heavily. But then, a smile formed on his face. That boyish smile that always seemed to taunt the Uchiha. \u201eI\u2019m sorry, Sasuke, but I\u2019m going to be Hokage. Fighting you this one last time on equal grounds was fun, but it is over now. We both have trained hard over the last years, but while you became a powerful ninja, I have acquired a ninjutsu from Kurama that can increase my chakra. Only few can even use it, but hey, I mastered it. So you better give up. You will not stand a chance against me if I\u2019ll start to use it!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s smile was sincere, but that just increased Sasuke\u2019s anger. What was that all about? Why should he give up now? Did Naruto really have an ace up his sleeve, or was he just bluffing? There was only one way to find out. Sasuke charged forward. When Naruto saw this, his smile vanished and a look of determination took it\u2019s place. \u201eI warned you.\u201c He then made hand-signs which Sasuke had never seen before. When he finished, he screamed: \u201eGiant no Jutsu!\u201c A white cloud engulfed him, but Sasuke had already jumped into the air. His fist was about to slam down where his rival had been, but it was blocked by a wall of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, Sasuke backed off in shock. What he had hit was no wall, it were Naruto\u2019s massive abs. The ninja had doubled in size, standing over 10 feet tall. His muscles had swollen slightly bigger as well. Sasuke looked up into his rival\u2019s face. The blond ninja crossed his arms, his biceps flexing in the process. \u201eWell, what do you think?\u201c The Uchiha did not hesitate a second. He had to use Naruto\u2019s lowered defense to attack again. So he jumped into the air to kick his opponent in the stomach. But the giant did not even bother to block the attack. He did not even budge when he was hit. Unlike Sasuke, who almost screamed when an incredible pain shot through his leg. The Uchiha quickly retreated. Keeping his distance, he thought about a good strategy. Naruto sighed. He seemed almost annoyed. \u201eYou still want to fight? Well, maybe this will change your mind.\u201c</span></div></div>",

Sasuke was frozen in shock. The blond ninja admired his new body for a while, then he looked down at the Uchiha, a smirk on his face. \u201eDo you now see that I\u2019ve become stronger than you?\u201c Sasuke breathed heavily. But after the first shock was over, he relaxed again. He would not be intimidated by sheer size. With incredible speed, he charged at Naruto. Size alone would not defeat him. He would show Naruto that his new jutsu would not help him. Sasuke was the stronger of the two and he would make Naruto remember that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto lifted one of his muscular legs. When his foot slammed down, Sasuke skillfully jumped out of the way. Cracks formed in the ground where Naruto\u2019s foot landed. The giant tried to kick him with his other foot, but the Uchiha dodged again. Naruto then bent down to grab his tiny rival. A hand, as big as Sasuke himself, descended upon him. But again, the Uchiha managed to avoid the attack. He jumped on the blond\u2019s arm and ran up to his shoulder. Before Naruto could react, Sasuke formed hand-signs, inhaled and breathed a giant ball of fire right into his opponent\u2019s face. Naruto let out a scream, stumbled and fell on his back. The ground quaked as the giant\u2019s muscular back connected with the earth. Triumphant, Sasuke jumped on the blond ninja\u2019s massive chest. But his victorious smile quickly faded, when he saw the angry look on Naruto\u2019s face, his eyes now glowing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as he could, Sasuke jumped off of the massive, muscular chest. Looking over his shoulder, he saw Naruto jumping back to his feet. The wounds on his face quickly healed. \u201eSo, you wanna get real? Watch this!\u201c Sasuke\u2019s eye widened when Naruto formed the hand-signs for his growing jutsu again. Fear washed over the Uchiha. He could not possibly grow even bigger. But he did. Sasuke tried to run even faster when the growing ninja\u2019s shadow swallowed him. But he did not get far. Finally, Naruto stopped growing at 1.000 feet tall. His big toe was now bigger than Sasuke\u2019s entire body. He had to do something, quick.</span></div></div>",

Before the giant could act, the Uchiha summoned a giant hawk. The bird took him higher and higher, while simultaneously getting more distance between him and Naruto. He had to get away for now. Then, he would surely find a way to deal with the giant. But could he even escape? Naruto was so big, he would surely be able to catch up easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the young titan just watched him, a taunting smirk forming on his face. \u201eSasuke, you look like a fly. I wonder what you plan to do?\u201c Sasuke cursed. He, too, did wonder what he should do. How could he defeat Naruto now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the giant extended his arm. Sasuke gasped at just how fast Naruto's hand caught up with him. He ordered his hawk to dash to the side. His rival's fingers, each several times bigger than Sasuke's entire body, closed around him. But thanks to his speed, the Uchiha managed to escape through the gap between index finger and thumb before the fist closed. No, he realized, not because of his speed. He managed to escape because Naruto was deliberately slow. He taunted him by not even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke cursed. But he could use this. Naruto's newfound power had made him arrogant and this arrogance would be his downfall. Finally, he managed to fly several hundred feet above the blond\u2019s head. At least he was out of his range for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto kept watching his opponent for a while, then he sighed again. \u201eYou just don't understand it, right? I am not the weak ninja you bet during our time in school anymore. I am more than that now. Let me show you. I held back until now, but it's time I finish this. You could never beat me in the first place.

Sasuke let out a terrified scream when his rival shot higher and higher into the air. His head got closer. Next, Sasuke\u2019s entire field of view was filled with Naruto\u2019s face, then his muscular chest, then his abs, then his crotch. A storm through the Uchiha around. Finally, Naruto stopped at about 10.000 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was a mere flee to him now. The giant let out a mighty roar, almost bringing tears of fear into Sasuke\u2019s eyes. He had to get away. Faster and faster, the hawk flew through the air. But when Sasuke looked back, Naruto\u2019s incredibly massive form still loomed over him.</span></div></div>",

Naruto god-like voiced echoed across the land, sending everyone to their knees. \u201eTajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!\u201c Immediately, hundreds of Narutos appeared all across the continent, filling the entire ninja world with titanic versions of the blond ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive of them stood in a circle around Sasuke. The area between them was about 2.000 feet in diameter. All of them grinned widely. \u201eTime for some fun!\u201c, their voices thundered in unison. Sasuke could not believe his eyes when the five of them dropped their pants, revealing their enormous, erect cocks. Naruto did not want to defeat Sasuke anymore, he wanted to humiliate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja army was shocked. As far as the eye can see, titanic legs rose into the sky, each of them dwarfing the surrounding mountains. The army was the combined forces of all the villages, but Naruto could destroy them all with just one stomp of his feet. And there were hundreds of him. Sakura was amazed, but when five of the Naruto\u2019s dropped their pants, while the others laughed childishly, she was filled with a strange mixture of arousal, embarrassment and anger. Next to her, Hinata\u2019s face was glowing red, her hand slowly finding it\u2019s way to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five Narutos then started jerking off. Sasuke quickly realized what this meant. He had to get out of range. As fast as he could, he flew upwards. He was knee level with Naruto, so it would take some time. After a few minutes, he was at the same height as the Narutos\u2019 massive ball sacks, each of them bigger than the Hokage building. Next, the five Narutos moaned in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninjas on the ground screamed. Drops of cum, each of them bigger than the meteor Madara had summoned, rained from the sky. Huge craters formed everywhere they landed. Soon, the surrounding land was filled with seas and mountains of cum. The stench was overwhelming. A lot of the female ninjas and also some of the males could not help themselves any longer and started to masturbate in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke tried to dodge the giant drops of cum. The heat from them and from the massive dicks made him sweat, but he pressed on. Finally, he was above Naruto\u2019s crotch. It had been a long way up, and yet, there was so much more to go.</span></div></div>",

Some of the Naruto\u2019s, including the one before him, shouted: \u201eHenge no Jutsu!\u201c White smoke blocked Sasuke\u2019s view. When it was gone, he was greeted by two massive breasts, big enough to smash an entire mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, a giant finger flicked Sasuke out of the air. He had been too fast, there was nothing the Uchiha could have done. While falling, he saw Narukos everywhere, showing of their massive tits. Eventually, he landed on something. In horror, he realized he was on top of Naruto\u2019s penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow swallowed him when one of the Narukos moved her face closer. Her titanic breasts swallowed Naruto\u2019s member as she titfucked him. Another one appeared next to the two giants. Her enormous finger picked up Sasuke with ease and put him into Naruto\u2019s dickhole. It was hot and moist. Sasuke tried to get out, when he heard a rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot cum exploded out of the dick, sending the Uchiha high up into the air. A Naruko moved closer, grabbing her soft breasts and pulling them away from each other. Sasuke was now in mid-air, the two gigantic, tear-shaped tits surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eI win!\u201c, cheered all the Narutos and Narukos in unison. The two massive tits moved closer, swallowing Sasuke\u2019s miniscule form. Finally, they slammed into each other, trapping Sasuke in between. Naruto was everywhere around him and beyond that, there were even more of him. It was over. He had lost. Naruto was just too powerful.</span></div></div>",

The only question was, how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke traveled far and wide in search of something, <i>anything</i>, that would give him the edge he needed to overcome Naruto.

His powerful muscles audibly creaked as they expanded beneath his flawless skin, adding greater and stronger mass with every passing second, and still he grew.<br>\r\n Sasuke could feel his chakra reserves growing along with his body, he was gaining far more power than anyone could ever dream of, and he wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sasuke finally stopped growing he was roughly 100ft in height.

Yet something told him this was not enough, that he could have so much more if he simply reached for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>More.</b>\" the dark god boomed and destroyed the tablet he'd found, then set his sights upon a new goal.

The nine tailed fox was on edge and this troubled Naruto even more. <i>Nothing</i> phased Kurama, and yet...<br>\r\n\"Something bad is going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was getting closer now, he could feel the beasts presence. The dark god had decided to target the most isolated beasts first, knowing that it take far longer for anyone to notice they had vanished, and stomped towards his target. The two tails. Matatabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatatabi preferred to keep to himself. He was distrustful of humans and avoided them, thinking they'd try to put him under their control one more. His experiences in the fourth shinobi war had only increased that distrust, he swore he'd never allow himself to be use again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Matatabi, Sasuke had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe azure flamed bakeneko was stunned when a gigantic figure appeared from nowhere and grabbed him. It took only a few moments for the two tails to recognize the giant that was assaulting him.<br>\r\nIt was the boy who'd imprisoned him and the other tailed beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke effortlessly held the struggling two tails in his grasp. He was still amazed at just how powerful he'd become. But he knew he needed to act quickly in case the beast tried to contact the others. The new god lifted the two tails to his face and activated his ocular powers, easily subduing the helpless bakeneko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatatabi was powerless and afraid. His fear became even greater when he felt his chakra being drained. The boy was feeding on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke shivered as he felt the power of the two tails flow into him. He became aroused as the beast began to shrink as he drained it. Watching it get smaller and smaller made him want to grab his cock and jerk off right now.<br>\r\n Matatabi was small enough to fit in Sasuke's palm now. The towering deity wanted everything the tailed beast had to offer and raised the terrified creature to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatatabi wanted to scream as his captor opened his, Sasuke's, mouth and let him fall inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark god rolled the two tails around with his tongue, enjoying the sensation of the beasts flames upon his taste buds. Sasuke savored the beasts flavor for a few more moments before tilting his head back, and swallowing the powerless Matatabi whole.<br>\r\n The gigantic teen rubbed his perfectly toned stomach as he felt the tailed beast finally fade away. The two tails had ceased to exist and now its power was part of Sasuke. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n He only hoped that the others would taste as good as this one.</span></div></div>",

The three tails was yet another isolated tailed beast and yet again it would be an easy target for the giant god.<br>\r\n Sasuke couldn't be bothered to walk to the beast and simply used his Rinnegan... and dropped himself directly on top of an unsuspecting Isobu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over before the poor creature even had a chance to react and he was added to Sasuke's ever growing power as the gigantic teen swallowed him whole.<br>\r\n A rumbling and gurgling emanated from the dark gods gut as he digested his meal... and then he began to grow.<br>\r\n Sasuke's booming laughter echoed across the landscape as he quickly doubled in height, reaching 200ft in a matter of moments. It seemed the more power he consumed the larger he would get, and Sasuke was all for growing bigger and bigger. He loved being huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunning deity ripped his upper clothing from his body, exposing his toned and powerful torso. He'd never been all that concerned with his appearance before but something about being so colossal made him feel sexy and he wanted to show off. Not that there was anyone around to admire his hotness right now. But eventually there would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two beasts down, Sasuke, knew he had to move more quickly. Eventually the others might notice that something was amiss and he didn't want to give them a chance to prepare for an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the tailed beasts fell to the dark gods hunger. With every meal his power grew, along with his size, until all that were left were the one tails, the eight tails, and the nine tails. Sasuke would leave the best for last, he wanted to be as big as possible before he challenged Naruto again.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe now 400ft god decided to head to the eight tails next and took his first steps towards the land of lightning, and the village hidden in the clouds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first sign that those in Kumogakure received that something was wrong was when the ground started to shake.<br>\r\nThe <i>next</i> sign they got was when a gargantuan hand appeared from between the mountain peaks, followed by a gargantuan figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth Raikage, A, looked on dumbfounded as he recognized the giant now climbing towards them. It was that brat from the hidden leaf.<br>\r\n\"How the hell is he so big?\" the Raikage roared and made his way outside, smashing through a wall, to confront the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja's of the hidden cloud village gazed up in shock as the giant teen finally lifted himself up to meet them, casting them all in shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke smirked as he heard the familiar voice of the Raikage yelling at him. While he'd once been impressed by the Kage's power he now saw the older man as insignificant as everyone else.<br>\r\n\"<b>You should move aside.</b>\" the dark god thundered mockingly, knowing that A would never back down. \"<b>I only want the eight tails and then I'll be on my way little humans.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smug and condescending tone of the giant only served to piss the Raikage off and he demanded that Sasuke leave. \"You can leave right now and I wont kill you brat.\" A bellowed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis threat was met by booming laughter from the godly Sasuke. \"<b>You are no threat to me little Raikage. I am a god now and you should be bowing before me. You should be praying that I don't crush your entire village.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething struck Sasuke in the face. The Raikage had launched himself upwards and attacked the colossal teen. <br>\r\nA was shocked when Sasuke didn't even flinch, his attack had absolutely no effect on the giant. Instead he was met by more mocking laughter as the self proclaimed god casually flicked him to the ground.<br>\r\nIf it weren't for the Raikage's incredible durability he would have been killed by the sheer strength that Sasuke's finger now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so it was actually painful for A as he struck the ground hard. He hadn't been hit like that since he'd fought Madara.<br>\r\nSeeing their leader knocked down caused the ninja's of the village to spring into action. They bombarded the giant with whatever jutsu they possessed. To no effect. The giant took every attack they made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke found the pitiful attacks from the humans amusing. They were trying so hard and failing so miserably.<br>\r\nThe hot god decided to have some fun and drove his hand into a group of ninja's, crushing some and sending others flying. He caught one of his attackers between his fingers and lifted the ninja up to his face. Sasuke licked his lips and opened his mouth,  depositing the terrified young woman inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the assembled  ninja watched in horror as they heard a loud gulp and saw the bulge that was their comrade move down the giant's throat and out of sight.<br>\r\nThey couldn't believe what they'd just seen. This monster had eaten one of their own without a second thought and sent her to the depths of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke glanced at the rest of the ninja's and smiled sadistically. The ninja woman had tasted good and he wanted to try out more of the local cuisine.<br>\r\n\"<b>You know its only polite that a host provide his guest with food.</b>\" the hungry god chuckled ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his intent clear to them the ninja's scattered in an effort to avoid being devoured by the massive invader. While many managed to escape him, for now anyway, many more fell victim the sexy gods hunger. They screamed and cried as he swallowed them whole, some felt strangely honored to become part of someone so gorgeous, but it was futile. It was obvious that they were no match for the towering deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was, almost cheerfully, consuming more villagers when something hit him in the back of the head. Annoyed at being interrupted while eating he turned and found himself looking down at Killer Bee. His frown turned into a smile, his prey had foolishly presented itself to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark gods mouth began to water as he anticipated consuming the man, and his tailed beast, in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw the sights, smelt the smells and felt the cool gentle breeze of his home village. Even a moronic being like him could recognize he lived in a truly blissful place even if he own existence within it was a strain. The blond ninja continued to walk the streets absently noting that their were several new shops along the main strip in town. He paused in his steps and glanced back at one shop in particular it seemed off. The sign simply read \u2018Ninja supply store\u2019 the  rubbed his head in confusion slightly as those were fairly common through out the village, it was just some thing was really off about this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond curiously walked across the street, the shop looked like any other the same stone work, the same sliding bamboo door entrance, the same windows with posters advertising their products.

At first he thought it was just another erection and paid it no mind. He reached down his pants to adjust himself only to realize that he was still soft. He waas further surprised by the fact that his package was starting to swell in the palm of his hand. Naruto immediately withdrew his hand and stared down at his junk, he saw a noticable bulge starting to form in his pants along with a growing tightness as they started to fill out. Some villagers were beginning to give him some strange looks as they walked by him. \"Man I gotta get home before anyone else sees me\". With that Naruto dashed in the direction of his home, with his member swelling in size the entire way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Naruto arrived at his apartment, although he was wincing a little since the feeling of tightness in his pants was stronger than it had been near the store. \"Argh what is going on here?\" he said to himself. He then started to strip down starting with his jacket and shirt, revealing a toned muscled body which resulted from intense training. Finally he got to the root of the problem and started to pull his pants down. It was taking longer than usual since the his pants would not come over the massive bulge he now had. With some effort he was able to finally get his pants down, leaving him in a pair of black briefs. This brought a sigh of relief from the boy since now his bulge was less confined. Naruto then decided to look down and was shocked at what he saw, in his briefs was a massive bulge the size of a soccerball. At first he touched it to make sure it was real, the massive package jiggled slightly sending a small wave of pleasure through him. Eager for more he started to rub his now massive bulge, which was stretching the briefs out even more since it was still swelling but not as much as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man how did this happen?\" he thought, his gaze then turned to the bottles of pills he purchased. \"Hmmm, it figures Pervy Sage had somthing to do with this. I didn't get stronger, but this is not so bad\" he smiled as he looked toward his massive meat. Naruto decided to lay on his bed and continue stroking the massive bulge he now had. He ran his hands over the tight material, slowly stroking his massive junk. He decided to reach inside to get a better estimate and was pleased with the results. His cock was too wide for his hands and the length was reaching about a foot long, soft! \"Ohh man this feels good, I'll bet no one is bigger than me\" he though to himself as he felt waves of pleasure just from fondling his massive meat. \"But why stop there?\" he said, clearly entranced by his massive size \"I wonder just how big I can get?\"</span></div></div>",

The very Naruto thing to do would be to just chug the whole thing, but he didn't know if this was reversible or not. Can't exactly be Hokage if you can't even move, although he might not exactly care at this point as he massaged his tight briefs. He was initially about six inches soft, something he had seen both his girl and guy friends staring at times. One pill added six inches in length, so how many would two add?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" As he downed two more pills. \"Now let's see how big I get this time!\" He yelled excitedly, as the pills kicked in instantly. He moaned excitedly as he saw the tight bulge grow even tighter as he started growing from the size of a soccerball to beachball sized!  Rips travelled down his briefs, as they struggled to hold in his package until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIIPP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis briefs finally gave up the ghost and ripped apart, his 24 inch, soft, cock flopping out, just touching the floor. He couldn't even reach halfway around it, as he sat now completely naked on the bed, as he looked at his three legs. Even soft, some of the veins were easily reaching the size of his finger. They were throbbing with each pulse of his heart, and each beat only seemed to send waves of pleasure down his spine. Naruto couldn't resist as he started trying to coax it to full hardness, rubbing and licking as blood filled it to full length, and lo and behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 36 inches hard, a full 14 inches around, as he stared at it fully hard, each slight touch driving his senses absolutely crazy, the purplish head slowly leaking pre down it. He grabbed it, as he slowly started rubbing his foreskin up and down, each stroke making him lust for more. He threw himself more into, flat-out using both hands as he essentially hugged and rubbed it, until it was finally too much. Naruto gasped, as he climaxed, wet sticky cum flying everywhere as jet after jet shot from his monstrous cock. Worn out from the effort, he suddenly fell asleep, covered in his seed, as his third leg continuously pulsed between his legs. When he finally woke up...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't find anything big enough to cover himself up with, so he had to be careful to avoid attracting too much attention. Naruto saw no point in wearing a shirt or sandals if he wasn't going to cover up the parts that mattered, so he decided to go au naturale. He rinsed himself off, then leaped out the window closest to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to cross the few rooftops in the village undetected, then he jumped into the forest outside Konoha, knowing exactly who else would be out here in the morning. He jumped from tree to tree, his massive schlong flapping around to his side as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was out taking a walk with his faithful pup Akamaru. \"What's Naruto doing out here so early?\" he asked his dog companion, getting a bark of agreement back. He then said, \"What do you want, Naruto? I can recognize your scent from a mile away! Just get out from behind the...\" At that point, Kiba's words trailed off as he stared in awe at Naruto, who walked out from behind the tree, his third leg dangling right in front of him with his soccer ball sized nuts right behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so...big?\" Kiba asked in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just flashed a toothy grin, saying, \"With these! Wanna try one?\" as he pulled a bottle of pills out behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blushed a little at the thought of himself getting bigger, but he quickly shrugged and said, \"I guess I could use a few more inches\", trying to appear aloof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba took the pill and swallowed it. Naruto offered him a water bottle to help it go down, and Kiba took a quick gulp. Kiba was about to say, \"What's supposed to happen now?\" when he felt a tightness in his groin area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba quickly took off his sandals then his pants, revealing his now huge bulge. That bulge was barely contained in his dark red boxer briefs. It was basketball sized, a little bigger than Naruto's had been when he took one pill. Little did Naruto know that this was because of Kiba's huge balls. Kiba's dick was actually only 11 inches, smaller than Naruto's had been at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Kiba took off his jacket and shirt, finding them unnecessary at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba then said, \"You mind if I have some more of those pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, being kind to his friends, said, \"Sure.

When he turned around to investigate, he saw a small cache of scrolls under the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackpot!\" He whispered to himself excitedly, glad to have finally found what he was looking for. He saw many medical jutsus that didn't really interest him, and he found a few good offensive jutsus as well, but then he saw a pile of scrolls that all had large red x's on them. They were sealed shut with stickers that read, \"DO NOT BREAK SEAL\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made Naruto more curious, so he took as many of those scrolls as he could with him, then he closed the trap door and rushed back to his apartment as quickly and as silently as possible. Luckily for him, he caught no one's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the scrolls in the middle of his room, then changed into his pajamas, as he was home, and they were much more comfortable than his street clothes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto walked into his apartment after a long day, groaning, mainly because it was yet another day of the God-awful Tora mission. Honestly, one of these days, he is going to have to \"accidentally\" drop a boulder on that cat! 'Honestly, you'd think that fat daimyo's wife would figure out something about why the cat runs away!' He took off his kunai pouch on his leg, and his weapons pouch, before looking inside the pouch and pulling out a special jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier that week, He, Kiba, and Sasuke had gotten together and decided to compare downstairs, and Naruto found out much to his annoyance, he was smaller both in height, and in cock size! He still hadn't heard the end of it, given Kiba's eight incher, and Sasuke's seven, compared to his four!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several days nonstop of ridicule, Naruto had had enough. He had remembered his mentor Jiraiya talking something about this just last week, when they went to go pick up the Old Lady for the Hokage's seat. Jiraiya was in the middle of one of his \"conquests\" when he mentioned some kind of male enhancement. However, it was only available in a store that was for 21 and above. Of course, Naruto didn't let this stop him, and with a simple Henge, was a brown-haired, green-eyed 21 year old, and before he knew it, had the jar right in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the jar for a bit, and decided he would go for it. He wanted to have the most fun of this, so he quickly undressed. He unzipped his orange jumpsuit slipping out of that, and took off his black t-shirt, revealing his toned, fine body. He wasn't buff or anything, but you could tell he was a ninja. He also unzipped his pants, undoing the button and zipper, and slipped out of those, leaving him in just his boxers and headband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nothing to lose...' He thought, as he popped open the jar and downed four pills at once. However, in usual Naruto fashion, he didn't read the label which said, \"Take just one pill a day. Any over dose could cause for a larger than desired organ.\" Of course, Naruto didn't have to wait long, as a heat settled in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on his bed, as sweat poured off of him, and he felt his cock erect, giving him a small tent in his boxers. But, he wasn't ready as the blood flow into his cock continued, and his cock swelled larger to compensate. He moaned as his boxers grew tighter in the front, the button straining to hold on, while they were stressed alongside his ass. His balls also swelled larger, growing larger with each pulse as they filled with delicious cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down, and saw his massive bulge, his two giant testes clearly defined, as his massive cock was forced to the side, and with awe, pulled his boxers down. His cock flew up, and with a massive smack, whacked him right in his impressive abs. Naruto tried to grab it, but found he wasn\u2019t even able to fit both hands around it! It was a massive 13 inches long, and 9.75 inches around, and his two balls had swelled to the size of apples!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was impressed by his own size, so much so that copious amounts of pre-cum leaked from his cock. He just couldn\u2019t resist, as his right hand wrapped around his giant length, and began pumping, moaning at the sensation of his hand jerking off the 13 inches of sheer perfection, while his left hand massaged his giant balls. It felt so amazing, the sheer pleasure, that Naruto had a crazy idea, as his cock leaked pre-cum, so much so that his lower area, balls, and sheets were beginning to get soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing another pill, he put in his mouth, as he bent forward, and enveloped his large cock, sucking as hard as he could. He drank his pre-cum along with the pill, and began bobbing on it, even as he continued to stroke his cock. After a while, he began to feel that familiar tightening in his chest, even as a new heat filled his cock. He gagged as his cock began to pulse even larger, growing thicker, even as his release hit him from his swelling balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot, thick cum poured down his throat, even as he continued his ministrations. He felt nothing except the sensation of his summing, and drinking his essence, even as it began spilling out and coating his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, as with all good things, it ended. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d Naruto groaned out, even as he looked at his new sized member, not yet softening, he guessed it was around 16 inches long now, and 10.5 inches thick, while his balls were now the size of ripe oranges. He stood up, as his prodigious member hung down to his legs, and with a cheer, jumped onto his bed, eager for the next day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His lovely, perfect, and <b>terrifying</b> wife Kushina lay on the futon beneath his hand, her midriff exposed with fresh ink marks surrounding a complex-looking seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>sure</i> we can't just go to the hospital for treatment?\" She asked, her face nearly a death-mask of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kushina, princess,\" he gulped, \"I know you're upset right now, but I've got it this time, I can <i>feel</i> it. There's no need-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need?\" She asked with a huff. \"I want a baby, Minato. We've been trying for months, and the <i>only</i> reason I haven't gotten a doctor involved by now is because for some reason <i>you</i> are too embarrassed to admit that we need medical help.  We've tried every stupid cure-all you could cook up in your twisted genius brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato opened his mouth to argue, but quickly shut it is she brandished a fist full of pregnancy tests at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried black market fertility boosters.\" She tossed down a negative test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried those lust potions you bought off that creepy witch lady.\" Three more tests. Minato couldn't help a lopsided grin; that had been an amazing, exhausting week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We stayed in that sex god temple on the coast and got blessed by that even <i>creepier</i> priest.\" Well, at least her hand was empty now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're doodling on our stomachs? What'll this even do?!\" She burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato sighed, and rubbed his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it seems crazy.  I promise, all the seals do is focus excess chackra back inward and enhance fertility. That's it; nothing fancy, nothing crazy.  I know you think I've lost it, it's just...I don't want to have to tell a doctor who works for me that I need help having a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina's eyes softened a bit, and she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We</i> need help, you dummy. And you've told all of those shady people just to avoid telling one person you should be able to trust. Just...promise after this doesn't work that we'll talk to a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met their fertility specialist a week later. Sure, they had fun trying, but the last test in the box came up negative, just like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor turned an interesting grey color when Kushina brandished her collection of negative tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you didn't hear?\" She asked weakly, looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\" Minato asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These tests were recalled; something defective during manufacture. They come up negative all the time.  Umm...let me just run a blood test quick, and we can talk about payment <i>if</i> you aren't pregnant already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato and Kushina stared at each other after the doctor left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The End of the Fourth War</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed as, for the first time in <i>forever</i>, he got to fall asleep in his own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWar sucked. War sucked hard. When he became Hokage, the first thing Naruto was going to do was outlaw war. But, good news, they'd won! The evil god lady and the tree thing were defeated, and Sasuke was his best friend again!  It felt like, after years of struggle, his life was finally getting back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dreams that night were...strange.  It felt like he was floating in a warm pond. In the distance, he heard strange chants and moans. As the sensations became stronger, Naruto tossed and turned in his bed, panting heavily.  In his mind, the chanting grew louder, his whole body flushed with heat, energy tingled along his skin.   Naruto took a deep shuddering breath as he felt dozens of warm hands slowly caress his body, sometimes light touches, sometimes tugging, or pinching.  His heartbeat pounded in his ears to the tempo of the loud chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shot awake with a gasp. Dim sunlight filtered through his window, and he felt a chill. He'd kicked his blanket off the bed, and his shirt and boxers were soaked through with sweat. Naruto shivered.  As his heartbeat steadied, he became aware of one last problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hard as a rock.  Jutting up between his legs, his boxers tented sharply, the fabric pulsing out slightly in time with his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breath now slow and even, Naruto reached down and guided himself out of the fly.  That obstacle out of the way, he firmly curled his fingers around his swollen penis, pleased to see a bit more skin between the head and his index finger. He'd been a bit of a late bloomer, but unless his eyes were playing tricks on him, it looked like he was still 'blooming.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled lazily as he started a slow rhythm, his breath picked up a bit as he felt his pulse quicken inside his hand.  Gently, he gave a squeeze, and moaned happily as he watched the head swell up from the extra blood.  Panting, he relaxed his grip...and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paused, a bit disappointed in the distraction, but flexed his abdomen to fold up and get a closer look. Leaning forward in a crunch, Naruto took in the continued swelling at the tip of his dick.  Frowning, he gave another squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fell back in surprise, hand falling away as he watched his dick <i>thwack</i> against his lower abs, releasing a drop of pre a <i>lot</i> closer to his belly button than he'd thought he could reach.  With a shaking hand, he retook his grip, and yes!  The sliver of skin above his fingers had gotten wider; his dick looked longer!  Reaching out with his other hand, Naruto gripped himself hand-over-hand, and let out a short breathy laugh when he realized he could feel the tip near the top of his second hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost unconsciously, his hands had resumed rotating, stroking, and sliding. Fascinated, and almost in spite of himself, Naruto squeezed himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting at the bottom, he tightened his hands one finger at a time. One, two, three, four -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of his dick popped through his top fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive, six, <i>seven</i> -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching himself get hard inside of one hand, but his dick was growing out of his <i>second</i> fist.  Naruto felt his balls clench, and watched as his now fully-exposed head swelled up <i>again</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight, <i>niiiiiiiine</i> -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto saw skin between his <i>second</i> fist and his dick head, and he was done. He shot <i>hard</i>, quickly fell back against his pillows again as his balls spasmed over and over, his hand falling uselessly to his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto's brain turned back on, he realized that his bed was going to need new sheets.  And he should probably get a mop for the floor.  As he started cleaning up, he decided he didn't care.  He spent the whole morning cleaning his apartment with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Akama run winded slightly currently going around a few boxes, sniffing get around for mice, and places kiba had missed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kiba wiped the sweat from his brow, having long since unwrapped his headband, and removed his jacket switching his usual fishnet armor for a white the, that he had ripped the sleeves off. And good thing to the attic had gotten un omftably warm, and while Kiba like to work up a good sweat, it had long since gotten hummed and stifling, his shirt sticking to him uncomfortably with sweat.<br>\r\n\u00a0Akamaru agreed, being covered in fur, but unlike his partner he knew the sooner they finished, the sooner they could leave, and that complaining only maids the heat worse.  As he walked farther back Akama ru caught the scent of parchment, and ink, old but strong, and as he searched for the source he came to spot something hiding way in, back. Bartering quickly  Akamaru went back looking for kiba.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of which, Kiba was coughing up a lung having accidently  knocked over a box, letting out some old clothes and cloud of dust.

For a clan of dog specialist, the inuzuka had a tendency of being pack rats. Far,far back into the mess that was the inuzuka compound attic where bunch of old boxes, but Akamaru, was digging around using his size to squeeze in around the boxes. Kiba simply picked up and stacked them mousing several out of the way.  Moving one particularly large box,  Kiba found what Akamaru had found. It was a box obviously,  but diffrent from the woodend creates, and cardboard boxes, thisone was dark and fine, a time layer of dust covering is blacknown painted surface.  Picking it up kiba could hear something rolling around. It was simple but elegantly  made, but what made Kiba curious was that it didn't seem to have a lid,  add he moved a finger around the box, Kiba felt a small prickl, causing hon to his and pull his finger awa, bring it to his eye Kiba could see a small drop of blood welling on his index finger, followed by a click.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Turning back to the box  kiba watched as it opted slowly before the lid suddenly snapped open to a perfect 90 degree.

At least we got to see Naruto after so long.\" Kiba asked Akamaru, as he laid on the couch in a slump. It was at that moment that Kiba realized that Akamaru was sound asleep. Kiba shrugged and stared at the ceiling in boredom. Kiba was dressed fairly lightly, with just a net shirt and his boxers on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was eyeing a hatch on the ceiling. His mom never let him go in there, and would get furious every time he tried. Kiba knew that his mom was gone, and his sister wasn't there to rat him out, so he considered opening it and checking out where it went. \"Maybe it's booby trapped.\" Kiba thought to himself as he hesitated. \"It's probably something I can deal with!\" Kiba thought, his macho teenage mind choosing impulse over reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, he stood on the couch, and unfastened the hatch. He nervously opened the door, his shoulders tensed up, and when the only thing that came out was a bit of dust, he relaxed, then grabbed the edge of the opening and pulled himself up into the crawlspace. It was surprisingly spacious up there, like a full blown attic, and a few small skylights kept the place surprisingly well lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked around, seeing all sorts of family heirlooms and priceless treasures. No wonder his parents never let him in here! He found a small box that said \"DO NOT OPEN\" Kiba ignored the directions and carefully opened it, finding an old scroll. He read it, finding out that it was a jutsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no details on the justu, just a formula. Kiba figured that it was forbidden because of how his mom kept him away from it. He didn't care, as he was imagining all the wonderful things he might be able to to with a new jutsu. He gave the hand signs, then once the jutsu started, he felt his chakra start to focus in between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Kiba asked nervously as junk began to feel warm. He was afraid to touch it, and he just closed his eyes, hoping it would go away. He felt pleasure at the same time, and he felt himself hardening up at the same time. He took off his boxers, and opened his eyes to see what was happening. His dick was rock hard, and about 10 inches long, which was Kiba's impressive normal length, however the warmth only intensified, and Kiba watched as his dick swelled out with each heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was ecstatic as it grew past a foot, and he fondled his balls, feeling them swell out as well. Soon, he was leaking lots of pre, and he used it as lube as he started to stroke his larger member. It filled his hand completely, and he couldn't even touch his thumb to his fingers anymore as he gripped his shaft. Soon, he was pumping hard, and his mind went fuzzy with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came right then and there, and he was lucky to be facing the wall, because his cum had coated nearly the whole thing. He came back to his senses, seeing his own cum slowly cascade down the wall and pool on the floor. He put on his boxers, only to feel his larger soft member fill out the front nicely, and along with his nearly tennis ball-sized balls, it left a large bulge in his boxers, stretching them to capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" Kiba said, and the very first thing he did was...</span></div></div>",

He looked at his reflection in the mirror, and cupped his now larger bulge. He had to be the largest guy in the village, no, in the country, maybe in all the countries! He turned around, being a little vain, admiring his toned body, and looking at his member's outline in his boxers, his dick and balls clearly outlined. He turned around, and saw how his boxers were stretched, his firm ass nearly visible from the stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba seemed to pause in thought for a little bit, before a mischievous little smirk showed up on his face. \"I wonder just how much fun I could have with this...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to his dresser, and opened it, pulling out his pants. Shinobi were supposed to be able to get ready quickly, so it was designed with no button or zipper, and of a very sturdy material. \"Time to test how sturdy!\" He eagerly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled them on, and after some difficulty, put them on completely, although there was a very heavy bulge present. At this point though, Kiba dug around in his drawer, and found a ninja tool for perverts; a pill that could give one a immediate hard erection. He chomped down, and waited for the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his pants immediately tighten as blood began surging through his manhood, his cock growing, trying to break out, but slowly being forced down his right leg. Kiba groaned as the sensation overwhelmed him. His member struggled and groaned, but despite some strain, the material still held. Kiba slowly stroked the bulge on his leg, watching as his pre left a giant wet spot on his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba couldn't wait anymore, and performed the jutsu again. The heat was unbearable this time, his heart pumping wildly as even more blood headed to its destination. He rubbed through his pant leg wildly, as it surged bigger and bigger. His balls were being crushed as they expanded too. Finally his cock began rising, and with a thump, tore through his pants. He needed to use both hands to stroke, as it reached up to his chest. Kiba thought it might have been 18 inches long, while his balls were bigger than baseballs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stroked faster and faster, feeling the veins pulsing on his cock, and with a final surge in his balls, he exploded. He wasn't certain if he was multiple shots, or one big one, but he knew only his release, until it cleared, and he saw a giant sticky puddle of his essence in front of him.. He rubbed his head sheepishly, as he looked at the mess, his softening cock dangling down. What did he do next?</span></div></div>",

He then put on a pair of loose sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were just loose around the legs, and they stretched thin over his bulge. Kiba was liking this, as he could still easily show off. He then put on his netted shirt and jacket, pocketed the scroll, and headed out. He just had to be careful not to get hard at all, or he'd tear right back out of his boxers and sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru was still sleeping, so he slipped out unnoticed. Either way, he confidently strolled through the Leaf Village, drawing many stares and glances, but nobody approached him.

Naruto turned around and looked down, and blushed heavily. \"Um... Since when did you... uh... pad your pants Kiba?\" He stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled heavily as he patted his lower area, much to Naruto's embarrassment. \"Heh, it's no padding! It's the real deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I saw you yesterday, and I know you weren't that big! No one grows that quickly in a single day!\" Naruto yelled, pointing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do when they have an awesome mega jutsu!\" Kiba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, a jutsu did that?!\" Naruto asked, somewhat in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to see it?\" Kiba chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh-, I\" Naruto stuttered.

He took his pants off, leaving him in a pair of ramen-patterned boxers. \"Only you would have boxers like those!\" Kiba joked, with Naruto saying, \"What else did you expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then held his hand out, and Kiba gave him the scroll. Naruto did all the proper hand signs, then the jutsu began. Naruto immediately felt his chakra surge to his crotch. He felt his junk warm up, and he got a little nervous. Soon, he felt the pleasure and he was hard as a rock, tenting his boxers. He was a little smaller than when Kiba started out. He blushed in embarrassment, then he started to feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like with Kiba, each heartbeat caused his dick to stretch out nearly an inch farther and fatten up to match, and each heartbeat also made his sizable balls swell outwards quickly. Naruto's mind was lost in pleasure, and his boxers were soon showcasing every detail of his dick and balls. Kiba noticed that Naruto's dick to ball ratio was much more ball-favored than his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was also liking the show, and he quickly pulled off his sweatpants as his own dick started to harden. Kiba swung both sides. Really, as long as it was an attractive human, that was enough for Kiba, and Naruto fit that bill. He was particularly getting turned on by seeing Naruto's dick swell up, and once his dick fully hardened, his own boxers didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's junk soon broke free from his boxers after that, and he was still growing. While Naruto seemed completely unaware of his surroundings, Kiba wanted to compare. He was surprised to see that Naruto's balls were already bigger than his, and his shaft was catching up fast. \"How come Naruto gets to grow more than me with one use?\" Kiba thought, before realizing that it must have been because Naruto had so much chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's behemoth continued to grow, surpassing Kiba's, with his balls nearing twice the size of Kiba's. Finally the growth seemed to stop, and Naruto's dick was a little over two feet long, six inches longer than Kiba's! His balls were each the size of a soccer ball, and the head of his dick was at chin level now. Kiba was jealous, but then he started to notice Naruto tense up. He was worried about what was happening, and soon...</span></div></div>",

Naruto moaned, as his eyes turned red, and his whisker marks darkened, and his cock pulsed slightly bigger, knocking Kiba in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" He grunted, as he fell to the ground. Problem is, at the same time, Naruto fell to his knees, dropping his cock right on Kiba! \"Oy, Naruto! Get this thing off of me!\" He yelled. But Naruto didn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis toes curled up, as his cock continued pulsing, and Kiba saw it began to slowly inch forward, and feel it too. Naruto's balls twitched and began expanding as well, veins pulsing as they began filling with more cum. Naruto's cock had surpassed his chin, and was now fast approaching beyond his head. Naruto's heartbeat was beginning to accelerate, and with that his growth. Before Kiba knew it, Naruto's cock had gone from mid-chest on him, to in front of his face. He couldn't resist just reaching a hand out to touch it, even as it still grew, placing a hand on his cock at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto has inadvertently tapped into the Kyuubi's chakra as well, causing even more growth. However, the Kyuubi had a lot more chakra, causing a lot more growth in Naruto! Two feet became three feet, and then four, and then finally five feet of pure man meat. Naruto's cock was officially bigger than him two years ago! His balls had swollen to the size of exercise balls as well. Naruto stroked what he could, even as Kiba tried the same. Naruto's eyes rolled back, as he hit his release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe probably came for at least 10 minutes, mind officially blown at the sheer pleasure he felt. Kiba at the same time came, although for a short time. At that moment...</span></div></div>",

He immediately began to blush at the sight of Kiba being butt naked with a massive package. \"Is this a bad time?\" Konohamaru said after an awkward silence, and Kiba said, \"It's fine. Come on in! Naruto's here!\" and Konohamaru let himself in, taking off his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how did you get so...big?\" Konohamaru asked, as he tried not to stare at Kiba's massive meat. Kiba said, \"Well, I found this cool jutsu, and one thing led to another. C'mon. Let me take you to Naruto!\" Konohamaru followed Kiba. As they walked to the hall leading to Kiba's bedroom, Konohamaru noticed a massive puddle of cum, flowing out through the hall like lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru cautiously took his first step into the cum, but there seemed to be no point, and when they got to Kiba's room, the cum covered his feet up to the ankle. Nothing could have prepared Konohamaru for seeing Naruto like this for the first time. \"Boss?\" He said as he looked at the small bed of cock that Naruto was laying on. While Kiba was fetching Konohamaru, Naruto took off the rest of his clothes, as they weren't going to be of any use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" Naruto said. He was completely spent a minute ago, but already he was starting to recover back to his old self. \"Was it the jutsu?\" Konohamaru asked, and Naruto simply said, \"Of course! Didn't Kiba tell you?\" and Konohamaru said, \"I didn't believe him.\" He even poked one of Naruto's massive balls, just to see if it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru said, \"I gotta see this jutsu for myself.\" and Kiba said \"Sure you can see it. ...\"</span></div></div>",

Awesome!\" He shouted, as he took the scroll. Unlike Kiba and Naruto, he undressed this time, leaving him only in a pair of boxers. He was already starting to chub a little, so Kiba could see he was pretty well-endowed himself. Probably came from being the Third's grandson. 'He's younger than me, but he might have more chakra than me still.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's body was lithe and fit, not overly bulky, not overly light. It kind of reminded Kiba of a monkey, which was kind of fitting given the Sarutobi name. Konohamaru eagerly performed the jutsu, but he was young, and figured they did it a few times, so when Kiba's back was turned, he performed it a second time! When Kiba turned back around, he was none too aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru gripped his cock with both of his hands as a pleasurable heat settled in it. His already impressive 8 inches began to grow even more! Veins pulsed as it began to stretch, even as Konohamaru stroked it feverishly, leaving no part untouched. Soon 12 inches had gone by, then 16, until it finally stopped at 19 solid inches. His cock stood straight up, having popped out of his boxers, showing it Kiba it came to about mid-pec on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings still weren't done as Konohamaru began involuntarily thrusting forward, as each heartbeat forced his balls to pulse larger and larger, inflating with virile cum just slushing around on the inside. Kiba noticed he seemed to be even more ball-favored, as they stopped just short of bursting his boxers at beach ball size. He just stayed their gasping, cum looking like it was ready to burst at any moment. Regaining his senses finally, he shouted, \"That... was ... Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

Soon, he pressed his dick against Konohamaru's, and though he was taller, Konohamaru's dick was just about level with his. He began rubbing up against Konohamaru's dick with his own, and he reached behind and massaged Konohamaru's massive balls. They were very firm and his sack was stretched to capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru copped a feel of Kiba's toned ass, and Kiba moved on to wrapping his arms around both of their dicks, squeezing them together an moving his arms up and down.

Although he probably didn't have enough chakra to beat Naruto in size, (all he would have to do is cast the jutsu again), he could at least take Konohamaru down!

It wasn't finished yet, as Kiba clenched his cock tightly. A different kind of heat was filling it this time, as it began to expand in girth as well! It was probably nearly half the size of his torso by the time he was finished.

Gigantic packages means more testosterone, and that testosterone was getting to work in all three of them. It was actually having quite different effects for each of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Kiba. He had gotten hairier, particularly with his pubes and armpits. He still lacked any facial hair and barely had a patch of chest hair, which was much more than when he started. The big feature in Kiba, however, was his height increase. While he started at around 5 feet 6 and a half inches, his height was nearing 5 feet 8 inches, and this increase in height would become very apparent if he ever stood next to someone. Kiba had always wanted a fatter dick, and he inexplicably got one. He thought he may have been controlling the chakra enough to cause that himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Naruto. His testosterone went almost exclusively to his muscles. Konohamaru and Kiba both dismissed it as just them seeing things, but Naruto had put on nearly 20 pounds of muscle mass since he started. He went from a fairly balanced body to one of a casual bodybuilder. His most impressive muscle gains were in his pecs, biceps, and ass. He had gained some height, but it was less than a half inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with Konohamaru, the testosterone went to his already massive libido. Even now that he just jacked off with Kiba, he was hard as a rock, and his balls were swelling up with pent up cum. He was more used to edging, so he could keep himself from losing his mind despite his desperate need to cum again. His voice had started to get deeper, but his body was unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru saw Naruto struggling to handle his massive dick, and he decided to help Naruto. As his balls continued to swell, his boxers started to rip, and once they started, they didn't stop, unleashing the true size of Konohamaru's balls. He lifted up Naruto's dick by the head, then began positioning himself in a frot with Naruto. Naruto didn't seem to care at this point. He just wanted release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that their dicks were together, it was easy to see that Naruto's dick was a little over twice as long, and it was a few inches thicker than even Kiba's now thicker schlong. The surprising part was that Konohamaru's balls had nearly caught up to Naruto's, and they both decided to sit on their balls so they could get closer. Konohamaru and Naruto continued this display, and Kiba was starting to get horny as well. Kiba...</span></div></div>",

He quickly let his cock join the frottage, glad to see he was now at least the second biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was quickly getting overwhelmed, happy at being the largest. His own growth was impressive as well, not just his cock. His muscles had beefed up even more, going from casual bodybuilder to dedicated bodybuilder. Together with the sweat from his activities, he was literally a sculpted blonde Adonis, each of his muscles clearly defined, even as his pecs started sticking out further, while his biceps and ass began to grow thicker and more plump as well. His other muscles weren't neglected as well, as he developed the desired washboard abs, while his leg muscles were simply perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru couldn't handle it as well, as his libido was now officially off the charts, as well as his ball size, as he had surpassed Naruto in size and was shooting past him. He could feel the extra size, as his cock was leaking pre-cum anymore, it was running like a faucet now, giving extra lubrication to everyone. His balls were giving him trouble as well, as the testosterone forced them to grow, which in turn produced more testosterone! It was only a matter of time before that dam reached a breaking point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of sex and sweat was permeating the air, as each of them began getting closer and closer to release.

Konohamaru, whose feet didn't touch the floor anymore from his perch atop his beanbag chair balls, couldn't handle it any longer, and he came, hitting the ceiling as shot after shot left his flesh cannon. With each shot, his balls slowly shrank down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba barely lasted any longer, and he reached climax before Konohamaru's second shot. He only had three shots, but they were massive. Naruto, in the meantime, was moaning from intense pleasure. The Kyuubi was using his chakra to enhance and direct Naruto's testosterone. Bones cracked as Naruto grew in height at a noticeable pace. At the same time, both his balls and tool were growing again, and his nuts were soon a big bigger than Konohamaru's at their peak, with his cock gaining an impressive two feet and touching the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the growth stopped, and Naruto had laid down on his cock just before he came, denting the wall in front of him. Kiba had collapsed in exhaustion at this point, and Konohamaru was still releasing shot after shot of cum. As all this was happening, the room was flooding with cum. The crack under the door had been sealed shut when cum dried on it the last time, so Kiba's room was becoming a virtual pool, and now the cum was up to waist height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was glad his bedframe was so tall, as the cum level reached only an inch below the top of the mattress when all three were done. This incident had taken a lot out of the guys, and they were spent. Naruto sat on his balls and rested his head on Kiba's desk while Kiba and Konohamaru shared his bed.

He was probably close to 9 feet in height, and his cock was just monstrous, easily 7 feet in length. If Naruto stood up, he'd probably break the walls with his massive schlong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled, and Kiba realized he was hungry!

How was he gonna get some food unless... he looked around at the veritable sea of white around him. He paused in thought for a moment, but hesitated. Did he... 'Yes.' He thought, as he leaned forward, and took a big slurp. It wasn't as refined as he thought, being very salty, with a very distinct ramen flavor, but it was food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba continued slurping, but one thing he was unaware of, Naruto's seed was now charged with the Kyuubi's chakra, and drinking it was having an effect. Kiba's tool pulsed as it easily began to surge a foot in length, while Kiba's muscles tensed and hardened, as his height reached a new threshold. Though he was formerly shorter, he was now starting to make catch up. His balls too started to throb, as their cum capacity began to increase at a rapid rate. He was easily 7 feet now, while his cock had grown to 4 feet long, and enormously thick, while his balls now were the size of over-inflated beach balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up to catch his breath, but ended up slipping and falling directly on Naruto, their cocks directly between them as they looked each other in the eyes, heavily blushing...</span></div></div>",

You can't get enough!\" Naruto said as  he sat there, cum up to the bottom of his chest, his dick at full mast, nearly hitting the ceiling. By this point, Konohamaru was sleeping, but his balls still churned, preparing for whatever might happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kyuubi was upset that Kiba was starting to catch up to Naruto, but it barely had any chakra left, so it started to sleep to recover.

Soon, he had the head of Naruto's massive dick up to his face, his own dick pushed to the side, but still throbbing with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's dickhole was pretty big, but not as big as Kiba's mouth.

Stomach full of Naruto's pre, he collapsed onto the bed as well, although he nearly sank into the pool of cum. Naruto was too close, and finally lost it, losing himself to his next climax of the day, filling even more of the room with his seed. His head leaned back, mouth ajar, as he was overcome by the sheer pleasure. A tiny little bit of it landed in his mouth, and brought him back to reality at the ramen taste, although it was saltier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, eyes finally seeming to clear from the haze of lust, and he looked around to get his bearings, before he actually realized what situation he was in. \"WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?!\" He shouted, as he finally realized, he was a freaking giant! Although it was quite disgusting, he stood up to get a grasp of the situation, and BONK! whacked his head on the ceiling. \"Ouch! Damn it! That hurt!\" He yelled, rubbing his head gently, as he bent down somewhat. He was tall enough he could touch the ceiling... with his head! While he was rubbing though, he saw his arm! He was ripped! He went through various flexes, testing their strength. He had impressive musculature, and it had a nice balance. He wasn't overly muscled, but each muscle was clearly defined, he saw, looking at his enormous biceps, his gigantic pecs, his impressive 8-pack, and his well-defined legs. Although he was initially built like a body-builder, his growth had balanced him out to look like a swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced over at Kiba and Konohamaru to get a grasp on them. Both of their balls were enormous, but the differences in them were pretty obvious. Kiba had started growing hairier in places, and slowly getting taller, while Konohamaru hadn't had much change, but Naruto could tell even now he could go for more, considering his 19 inch pole was standing directly at attention. After the last couple hours of rutting, at least Kiba was finally worn out. Although, even he had to admit that his balls were simply oversized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't say much in his department though, he thought, as he reached down to scratch, and found there was a lot more to scratch. His new manhood easily dangled past his shins, and was nearly as thick as now much thicker forearm. And that was SOFT! He was almost afraid to see what it was like hard. \"How do I explain this to Baa-chan?\" He said to no one in particular, as he pondered what to do next. Needless to say, it was very brief as his stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbled, as he rubbed his stomach, but he enjoyed the little treasure trail he had on his stomach. \"What to do...\" He couldn't go to Ichiraku's, as there was no way any clothes would fit him again, but he also didn't want to starve. Of course... he looked down at the pool of cum underneath him. He didn't want to, but it at least tasted like ramen. On the other hand, he did remember that Kiba grew after he drank it as well. He was already big, so did he want to grow bigger? Then again, if he was gonna be a giant, why wouldn't he want to be the biggest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes burning with excitement, he slowly bent down, and taking a deep breathe, started drinking. It wasn't nearly as bad as he thought it would be, although the ramen taste wasn't nearly as strong as he hoped it would be, and it was definitely salty. He won't deny though, it was filling! He kept it up, drinking and drinking until there was barely any left. He gasped, breathing heavily, filling stuffed, but at the same time, refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a quick pulse, and whacked his head on the ceiling again. This time, he fell to the ground, causing somewhat of a thump. Wasn't he just shorter than the ceiling? Oh wait, cum equaled growth, and he literally just drank half a room full of it. He looked down, as he saw he was now slowly expanding, while his cock quickly hardened again, also beginning to expand. Very quickly, Naruto saw he was starting to get pinned. \"Uh oh.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Naruto, Kurama was chuckling as well, as the brat began to expand. It may have only been his second time screwing around with male growth, but it was certainly fun. Of course, the first time was pretty damn hilarious. That wretched previous jinchuriki of his Kushina never let him have any fun, but he did use the opportunity whenever it arose to screw with her spouse Minato. He would always get so confused, especially when previously well-fitting clothes would no longer fit, due to expanding body parts. Of course, when it came time to consummate their marriage, he pulled it off to the extreme, although it took a while to take effect. He was always quite amused whenever he thought back to that incident, and he was quite happy to cause it again! Maybe he could see if he could involve any of the other guys who got caught up in it as well, that is, if any of them were still alive from those days...</span></div></div>",

Naruto was skinny, now, since his muscle had spread out, but Kurama was fixing that too, and soon, Naruto's muscles were swelling out, but not much, only getting him back to the swimmer's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock, which now only came up to his chin, was the next thing to grow.

Of all of them, he had been the least changed so far. His height was still mostly the same, and his cock was, while way above the curse, still palm-able. Right now, both his hands were busy jacking off his 19 inch rod, and judging by the looks of it, he was too far gone in the pleasure to care about anything else. However, his balls looked like they had been growing for a while. They had to have been close to the size of Naruto\u2019s, which couldn\u2019t have been gone for a average teenager entering puberty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba visibly saw his balls shudder, pulse and throb, as they went into overdrive. But something strange happened. He saw Konohamaru\u2019s cock about to twitch, like it was going to cum or something, but then it just lengthened! \u201cWha\u2026\u201d Kiba muttered as he saw inch upon inch get added, and it wasn\u2019t close to stopping yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Konohamaru moaned, as he continued stroking, but Kiba noted something was off\u2026 his voice was deeper! He took a closer look, and it was like he was getting older! He looked as Konohamaru\u2019s appearance seemed more defined, and his face seemed more mature and angular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru groaned as his muscles began twitching as well, slowly but surely, awesome definition coming into his form. Kiba watched as he soon gained an incredibly defined form; one that could turn straight guys gay, and lesbians straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reacted though, at what sounded like a crunching sound. He turned to Konohamaru, and it was from a visible growth in length! Kiba watched as he slowly inched higher, and higher, bones cracking and reforming, even as he continued his slow growth. He watched as 7 feet came and went, and then 8, 9, 10\u2026 Eventually, he was 14 feet high, and he still had room to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock wasn\u2019t far behind, as it grew to a jaw-dropping 12 feet in length, and while it wasn\u2019t the biggest out of their group; that honor went to Naruto, it was still larger than most people would ever dream. Konohamaru groaned as he continued stroking. While he may not have had the biggest cock, he had the largest balls by far, bigger than both Kiba\u2019s and Naruto\u2019s combined. Even as tall as he was, he could comfortably perch on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned as he continued, gently rubbing a hand over his more defined physique, somewhat aware of what was happening to his body, gradually leading down to stroke his new treasure trail. He eventually sped up his strokes, moving his other hand on top, and he felt his lower muscles tighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe literally painted the landscape white, as the amount he came was too much for Kiba to comprehend. To his fortune at least, or so he thought, it had all landed away from him. Naruto was not as fortunate, even as he continued sleeping away. He was absolutely soaked. Kiba thought he had escaped a white devastation, until a stray blast hit him directly in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba coughed, as he tried to gain his breath, choking on Konohamaru\u2019s stray cum blast. He gradually wiped his face, although he thought the cum disappeared faster than it should have. He took another look at Konohamaru, and saw that he had fallen asleep somewhat humorously, his balls being so enormous they kept him upright, while his cock had finally grown soft as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba felt a sudden surge as his cock grew another inch, and he felt himself grow a little bit in size as well. What had happened was Konohamaru\u2019s balls had grown so big that they produced so much testosterone that his body couldn\u2019t process it all. Whenever he came, he released that excess testosterone in addition to his cum. Kiba got a little bit, but Naruto was absolutely soaked in it\u2026 Does Kiba realize what\u2019s going on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba felt that growth. He knew he did. He figured that it must have been from Konohamaru's cum. \"I can't believe that runt is probably twice as tall as me now!\" Kiba said, feeling quite inadequate at only about seven and a half feet tall now. Kiba was eager to try drinking some of that cum, and the source wasn't too far away from him. Thanks to his previous use of the jutsu, he was nearly stuck atop his balls. He slid off the front, letting them sit behind him as his feet reached the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick was a modest semi, keeping it just off the ground as he waddled forward, dragging his balls with him. He didn't have to walk far to get to Konohamaru's cock, which was resting atop his balls, not quite touching the floor. Kiba went up to the head of his cock, drinking up the cum that was leaking, feeling the inches pack on, both to his body and over-sized package, just from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis provocations didn't go unnoticed, and Konohamaru felt himself getting hard again. He didn't know what was happening, so he decided to lean back and enjoy whatever it was. Kiba hugged Konohamaru's cock head, barely able to wrap his arms around, and he rode the cock up, his own jutting off to the side. Kiba greedily drank Konohamaru's pre, and then the fun part came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's huge balls easily facilitated another orgasm, and Kiba put his growing mouth on Konohamaru's dick, catching most of the first shot, and taking the second one right in the face. He vaulted up for the last shot, which hit him in the chest and knocked him off. Kiba landed on his balls, but due to their titanic size, he barely felt a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sat on his balls, enjoying the feeling of the growth. When all was said and done, he was about 11 feet tall, which was still the shortest of the group, but at least he got that far. If anything, his proportionally large package had grown even larger compared to him. His hard-on stuck high in the air, nearly 24 feet, the biggest in the group now! His balls were also gigantic, about as large as Konohamaru's, if not larger! His feet came about a third of the way down when he sat on them, and he was clearly shorter than each individual testicle. He was regretting his earlier decision to spam the jutsu, as mobility was getting harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles had grown out some, and he was beefy, but not quite to the point of looking like a bodybuilder. He also got a little hairier, though it wasn't very noticeable compared to how he was before the Konohamaru treatment. Kiba was about to take care of his raging hard-on when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The brat's consuming of all that cum, together with getting some much needed rest, was enough to replenish his chakra. Now that he was soaked in that growth cum, it was time for some mayhem!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto became engulfed by a hazy red wave of red chakra, his eyes turning red with slitted pupils yet again, as his lovable whisker marks became more pronounced. This time though, unnoticed for now, his ears became pointed, starting to almost resemble elf ears, but more feral-looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moaned, as his muscles visibly pulsed, his ass firming even more, as it became two globes of immense power. Kiba and Konohamaru would have loved to pound that now. His pecs pushed out even more, starting to cut off sight of his lower regions, and his biceps bulged even larger, two giant spheres of raw power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock was next, pulsing heavily, turning a bright red color as blood was forced through it very quickly, and it grew very fast, easily doubling in size in a matter of seconds, a monstrous 34 feet, and Kiba watched in awe as his gonads quickly followed, definitely out of proportion on him, his cock leaking that delicious pre like a faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds though, Naruto's body quickly followed, arms and legs morphing somewhat out of sequence as his torso elongated as well, and finally, his head finished, bringing him to a terrifyingly large height of 50 feet! He easily towered over everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba watched though as Naruto's ass seemed to plump a little more, and to his shock, and a little bit of horror, he saw as Naruto's spine seemed to visibly elongate, and before long, some strange kind of hair or... fur spread along it, and before he knew it, Naruto had grown some kind of... fox tail, covered in red-orange fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercome by lust, Naruto grabbed his giant dick, and began stroking it, running his tongue against it, the sensations driving him crazy. He massaged the pulsing veins, the head, anywhere he could touch, and before long, Naruto felt his lower stomach tightening, and his gigantic balls shuddered as he began to cum, his white essence rushing out of his cock, almost like a fire hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished, Naruto fell to the ground, panting heavily, barely aware of his new appendage while Kiba and Konohamaru watched in awe...</span></div></div>",

That wall was probably 20 feet tall or so. He gulped, then stood up, seeing just how tall he was. He was a little worried about it, but he had to admit to himself that he was a little turned on by it at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, overlooking the village, and inspected his muscular body, feeling something furry by his butt. He grabbed it, and pulled on it a little, just to confirm that it's real, and his heart sank once he realized that it was indeed real. He became even more horrified when his thoughts turned to Kurama. Was the Kyuubi somehow controlling this growth for his own means? Naruto was concerned about what that might mean, but other than appearances, he still felt like he was the one in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama, on the other hand, was stretching out and relaxing. He may still be in a cage, but now that cage was much roomier. His chakra was influencing Naruto's growth so he could have all this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then looked at his friends. Konohamaru wasn't as small as he would have expected, and he was sitting on a massive pair of balls. Kiba looked like more penis than teenager now. \"I guess you guys got bigger, too!\" He said, and Kiba said, \"Yeah, but you grew like a weed! I'll catch up soon enough!\" and Konohamaru said, \"I don't know what happened, but this is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, in this moment of sobriety, was still concerned, though.

Plus, he had this stupid tail to worry about! He grumbled as he ruffled his hair, but froze when he touched his ears. \"EH!\" He yelled, as he felt them, realizing they're freaking pointed! First a tail, now his ears?! Give him a break... But if he kept growing bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" He said, clapping his hands together. \"Time to move you two!\" He yelled, down to Kiba and Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Don't know if you noticed, but we might have a bit of a problem with that...\" Kiba yelled back, gesturing to the fact his schlong was twice the size of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk, Konohamaru?\" Naruto asked, thinking about how they would do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru adjusted himself, and after some stretching found his feet could at least touch the ground. A little more adjusting, and if he picked up his giant sack, and he could do just fine! \"Doing A-OK boss!\" He yelled back up to the towering Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally noticed how much deeper Konohamaru's voice had gotten, and he was decently surprised at how much he had developed! He looked only slightly younger than him now! He looked over his perfectly defined muscles, and even a luscious treasure trail that developed, stopping just below his navel. \"Great!\" He yelled back down, trying not to wake everyone up, as he bent down, and grabbed Kiba, one hand wrapped around his giant dick, the other lifting him up via his giant scrotum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAGH!\" Kiba yelled, taken aback both by the sudden lift, and the fact Naruto's grip was so freaking arousing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to step as softly as he could, although he still left a giant tremble, while Konohamaru followed, carrying his beanbags along like some kind of manpouch.

To make someone like Naruto submit and admit he was the better man was a sweet, sweet victory.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure thing, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show what a man look likes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kiba cockaly replied. Naruto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blushe only grew brighter but kept quiet as he turned and began walking home. Kiba smirked as he walked after Naruto his bulge swinging with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The walk back was short but relatively uncomfterble to Naruto as Kiba occasionally speed up and bumped his package against Naruto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own butt, almost hotdogging him. Kiba simply smirked arms behind his head, enjoying how Naruto was attempting to hide his own growing bulge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was only a few minutes to naruto's apartment but it felt like hours for the blond with Kibas teasing, luckily no one was around to see Naruto in his humiliation. Before Long they were in front of Naruto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment door, Naruto bending forward slightly to unlock the door. Kiba seeing a chance Grabbed Naruto's waist, getting a startled yelp from the blond. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Kiba what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big, mmm\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto began as kiba quickly squashed his package against Naruto's backdoor without restraint.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right dobe, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m top dog, and I know you want it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kiba said moving his hip to grind his bulge against Naruto.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cS-ahh, Some one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to, mm s-see us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto said biting his lip to hold in his moan. Kibas dick felt so good, and Naruto swore he could feel Kib\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balls gurgling as they made more seed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe, better hurry and open the door then, unless you want people to find me fucking that sweet ass of yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kiba gloated pressing in slightly harder. Naruto groaned, biting his lip almost hard enough to draw blood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naruto fumbled slightly with the lock, before mageing to getting it to open, almost falling to the ground, had it not been for Kiba holding him in place. Kiba was slightly disappointed NAruto managed to open the door, but now the real fun would start at least. Pulling Naruto upright Kiba let the blond go as he walked into the apartment. The first thing that hit him killed his boner fairly quick was the smell. Naruto had obviously not cleaned in a while, and it showed. Old ramen cups everywhere, dirty laundry in a corner, Kiba couldn't help but think  that this might be what his room would look like if not for his mother  and sister constantly bugging him to clean up the place.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeriously dude how do you live in this mess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kiba asked covering his nose, with the bottom  edge of his collart. Smell of dog, definitely beat the smell of dirty room anyday.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t planning on having anyone over today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto said crossing his fingers. Mind you Naruto had been meaning to clean for a while, but he had never really gotten to it(IE:To lazy t clean).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several clouds of smoke poofed into existence before clearing to reveal five Naruto clones. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey boss, man you haven't even undressed Kiba and you already brought us out? I mean sure we want to see what Kiba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s packing if it real ,but still,\u00e2\u0080\u009d One of the clones said slightly oogaling Kiba and his hidden goods, that left little to imagine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't summon you for that, I need your help cleaning the apartment real quick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Naruto hissed turning red again. Kiba simirek hearing at what The clone had revealed, but still felt slightly annoyed NAruto though he was padding himself to some degree. Kiba would definitely have to show the blond who was top alpha dog.<br>\r\nIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long for all six Narutos to clean up the small apartment, before the cloned poofed out from existence, leaving only  a slightly nervous fox boy and an eager Kiba.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He  had no idea where Kushina was, and his only child Naruto was in his hands. He smiled sadly as he knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly teleporting to the air above the the Kyuubi, he summoned the toad boss Gamabunta to help him with dealing with the Kyuubi, although he was expectedly cranky. \"Brat, why have you summoned me to deal with this of all things?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't argue for now, Gamabunta! I need time to prepare a seal!\" Minato pleaded, but Gamabunta looked around, and quickly agreed. He rushed forward to keep the Kyuubi busy as Minato finished his seals. \"Bunta! Please back up!\" He yelled, as he announced his seal. \"Reaper Death Seal!\" As the hand of the death god quickly sealed half of the Kyuubi into him, he quickly sealed the other half into Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said his farewells to Gamabunta, as he made sure Naruto was comfortable, as he looked to the unseen death god. \"I'm ready.\" He said, as he prepared for his soul to be taken away. Although he was unprepared when the shinigami smiled, somewhat pervertedly, as a white light overcame him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato woke up later, in a place with white rooms. He might have thought it was heaven, if not for the strange smell of antiseptics. \"Nope, this ain't heaven... it's hell. It's a hospital!\" He groaned. \"Wait, why am I alive though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he heard a knock at the door, as a nurse came in. She kind of reminded him of an academy student he saw, who really wanted to be a nurse. \"Lord Namikaze, it's good to see you've been doing well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially since it's been so long since we've heard from you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard from me? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, after the Kyuubi attack you disappeared for 16 years! We had thought you were dead until we found you lying in a random field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, so that wasn't just a regular nurse. She WAS the academy student he saw, only 16 years older! \"Wait, then that means, Naruto, he's 16 years old now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse didn't make the connection. \"He was born the same day you vanished after all, so it makes sense. Although there was one thing we couldn't explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Minato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\" She said as she held a mirror out, and Minato screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't an adult anymore! He looked like a teen! Matter of fact, he looked 16 or 17! He had to be about Naruto's age, as well as those of his friends! \"What the hell?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato was having an interesting time dealing with this, not only being in a time 16 years later, but also suddenly being a teen! \"How does one deal with that?!\" He yelled, frustrated, although he decided to look around, cause why not. Well, he wanted to, but he was feeling a sudden urge he hadn't felt since he was a teen. Back in a teen body, the hormones weren't helping! He was horny! What should he do!</span></div></div>",

He really wanted to look around, but he really couldn't handle the urge right now! \"I have zero self-control...\" he muttered, as he took off his shirt on the way to his room's shower. He paused to look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely kept his build at least. He wasn't built for power, as evidenced by his lean muscle. He was built more for speed and lethality. It's the reason he wiped Iwa's army off the map after all. Still curious, he took off his pants as well, leaving him in just his boxers. His legs were nice and toned as well. Minato continued examining his younger self, even as he took pride in his bulge, which took up a bit of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe often joked around that there were two reasons he was called the Yellow Flash, and only Kushina knew the second reason, his downstairs. He really got some good genetics, as his bulge, for a regular person was quite impressive. Kushina even had to make him some custom boxers, as he couldn't find any that could fit. Although he was younger, there didn't seem to be any change downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make sure though!\" He joked, as he turned on the shower. Once it got hot, he slowly pulled down his boxers as he checked out his \"Yellow Flash.\" It was a pretty impressive size, clean-shaven of course, at 7 inches flaccid, and 10 inches hard. His balls were about the size of a baseball each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned in pleasure as he stepped in the shower, letting the hot water sooth his tired muscles. He rubbed his chest as his hands slowly made their way down to his cock, which he slowly rubbed, enjoying the pleasure as blood slowly pumped into his member, until finally, it was hard, 10 inches long, and 5 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato moaned as he pumped his turgid length, enjoying the pleasure as he rubbed with one hand, feeling it pulse underneath his grasp. He slowly backed against the wall, as he gradually increased his speed faster and faster. Finally he added his other hand as he continued stroking it, massaging all areas, both the head and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept this pace up for quite a while, as he stroked it, feeling the pre and water lubricating his motions. He started feeling a tightening in his lower area so he knew he was close, and the feeling built until he knew he was about to release, so he braced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn't feel like an orgasm, it just felt like every pleasure button on him was pushed at the same time. He looked down, and he saw that his cock was growing! It pulsed slowly, as his hands were forced apart, no longer able to fit around it, as his length grew to 14 inches long, and 7 inches wide! His balls also grew, growing to the size of big oranges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned as he hit his release, giant streams of cum streaking from his cock as his giant balls emptied themselves, leaving both the shower and himself covered in white, warm goo. He slid down the wall, overwhelmed at the pleasure as he took deep breaths, water running over him until he recovered and shut the water off, all while his cock slowly softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out and dried himself, as he looked at his new downstairs. Now it was 10 inches flaccid, and his balls were bigger too. He struggled to get his boxers on now, leaving it really tight in the front, looking like he had stuffed a miniature basketball in them. He finally got dressed, although he had to deal with the new weight in the front, wondering what happened to him to make his cock grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to leave to see Konoha, until he felt a tingle downstairs again. What happened?</span></div></div>",

But then he had gone on to save the village it self, When Hinata had learned that she had struggled not to faint. Finally the village would start to recognize her precious naruto! \u2018But what of me?\u2019 She thought glumly, all she was and is, a weakling heiress who probably would be replaced by her younger sister. \u2018How would naruto find me appealing or attractive?\u2019 She continued to pace her room, which of course fitting the Hyuuga style was enormous, it probably was larger then naruto\u2019s entire apartment in truth. \u2018I need to make naruto notice me!\u2019 She thought with a grim determination as she opened up the bamboo sliding door and ran into the dark hall, she of course was using the best of her skills to make as little noise as possible. But as she lived with a group of extremely talented ninja she knew she must hurry, Her father she knew wouldn\u2019t look kindly upon her wandering the compound in the dead of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy some miracle she made it out of main house, which had been a maze of darkened corridors and long flowing halls. She dropped all pretenses of Stealth now and broke into a chakra fueled dash. The night was a bright one, the full moon hung in the cloudless sky, She skillfully leapt up the thick stone walls. She was not foolish enough to attempt to go through the main gate of the compound. Shortly after making her way through the woods around her estate she made her way into the village proper. But all the while she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was being watched or followed. She walked through the crowded streets, oddly enough they were packed still despite it almost being another day already. But then she recalled that the village had narrowly avoided being destroyed and despite the somber mood by the death of the hokage some of the people would want to party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed through several stalls selling their wares, she nodded politely and spoke courteously to them. She shivered slightly and groaned, her jacket hardly was the best defense against the cold that there was. But she was able to move quickly in it and that was why she grabbed it on her way out of her room. In truth Hinata had little idea why she was even out here, she could get caught be in trouble\u2026\u2026But she wanted to see naruto, but how would the savior of the village be impressed with such a weakling girl like her? She stopped in her tracks and stared down at her feet trying not to cry. She noticed her chest, flat as could be, she didn\u2019t even really need a bra, it was like she was a boy nearly! She remembered her basic ninja training, how their sensei had instructed them to use their curves to gain a edge in their missions. \u2018Would that work on naruto?\u2019 she thought for a moment before nodding to herself. If having a larger chest would secure her in his eyes so be it! She set on off through the village with a new sense of vigor! Only to stop in her steps just a few feet later. \u201cHow exactly am I supposed to grow them!?\u201d She bit out in frustration as she signed. She then glanced up at the shop she had been walking by, It was odd; it was covered in old sun rotting wood but she couldn\u2019t remember the shop being here before. The sign read: \u201cThe beauty parlor\u201d She blinked, the lights where still on and perhaps they would have some thing to assist her in there! She with a new sense of confidence totally freign to the girl she walked in, with a grunt she pushed effort into opening the clearly old sliding door and walked in. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although Konohamaru knew as well that Naruto was incredibly hung downstairs as well. He made being \"hung like a horse\" seem small. He actually had to use special seals to keep it all inside, and he still made a big bulge in his pants! Going with him into hot springs did have an added benefit though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't really understand why, but he knew it had something to do with Naruto being a jinchuriki. Yes, he at least knew about that now, especially with the Akatsuki... But still, if he wanted to be able to fight with Naruto, he needed to get older! With this scroll he found though, that might be possible. If the Boss's growth was because of the Kyuubi, the scroll would work. He found it while searching through the Hokage's library (without permission of course!). According to his grandpa's records, after the Kyuubi attacked, it left a lot of chakra residue, and it couldn't be disposed of, so they only sealed it away. If he could use that chakra, it might help speed up his development!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the scroll, and placed his hand on the seal inside, channeling his chakra into it, and he groaned as the chakra started channeling into him, veins sticking out all over his arm as it flowed into him. He groaned as he starts changing. How old does he get?</span></div></div>",

He groaned as he especially felt a heat in his groin. He rapidly reached down, trying to undo his pants, even while he was disoriented by the heat. Opening his pants, he saw the bulge in his boxers as his 5 inch cock erected. He saw his manhood twitch as it slowly got larger, putting more and more stress on his underwear as the rest of his transformation continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs expanded further, muscle and height developing, his pants slowly ripping apart, even as they grew tighter from his growing bulge in front, and his ass in the back, as it slowly became firm with muscle as well. He took his attention from his now 12 inch cock, slowly leaking pre, as a sudden pain occurred in his arm. He grabbed it as the pain increased, as it lengthened as well, lean and powerful muscles forming from his twig arms, destroying his sleeve. He grunted as the process repeated with his other arms. Finally it centered in his torso, as his body lengthened, ripping his shirt apart, as his muscles pulsed, his pecs protruding a little bit, and he gained a light six-pack, as the muscles in his back developed to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see it, but his face matured as well, more boyish features starting to develop into those of a young man. His hair lost a little spikiness, as his bangs grew out a bit more. His eyes sharpened, and gained a more maturish look, even as his baby felt melted away into budding handsome features. All in all, he was going to melt quite a few hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation had one last thing to finish, as his pants ripped off, leaving him just in his boxers. Konohamaru groaned as the sensations from his still growing cock continued, each pulse of his heart sending his large member twitching and growing. He slowly moved his hands down his chest until he came to the base of his manhood, visible due to the massive stretching of his boxers, each girthy vein visible on it. Each growth caused his poor boxers to stretch, as popping stitches could be heard all over them. It wasn't long now, Konohamaru eagerly thought, as he grabbed his large pole's base, hands barely able to fit around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty tear, his boxers finally gave up, leaving Konohamaru's sexy teenage form entirely visible, as his 18 inch cock smacked him in the chest, pre heavily leaking. His balls had grown as well, Konohamaru barely able to close his hands around them. Using his natural lube, he began to stroke, the sheer pleasure forcing him to his knees, as each stroke drove him closer to climax. He moaned as he stroked his giant cock, feeling each pulse driving his senses crazy. With a groan he felt that tightening in his abdomen, as he jerked off faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" With a moan, Konohamaru came, as his seed shot out of his cock, giant white streams that flew everywhere. Breathing heavily, he slowly got up, as he looked in a mirror admiring his older body. He had to be somewhere close to Naruto-nii's age now! \"Yes! Now he'll fight me!\" He shouted, making a fist pump. Although he rapidly felt that heat return, as the new hormones had given him quite the libido. This is troublesome, should he go show Naruto,  or should he see if a Kunoichi is willing to help him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A/N He basically looks like he did in Naruto: the Last)</span></div></div>",
