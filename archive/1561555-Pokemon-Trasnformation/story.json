You recently moved to the city of New York, and you have an interview to be an assistant photographer.<br>\r\nAs a 16 year old boy, you don't have a car yet. This is the best job around, and you can't afford to miss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, not if you don't want to earn the money for one of those brand new Playstation fives..............<br>\r\nQuickly, you turn the corner and jab the walk button on a traffic light impatiently. You'll never make it to the interview at this rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to think angrily to yourself. How come your alarm clock had to be broken this morning? Seriously, it's the year 2019............ you'd think that technology would be better by now for alarm clocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then sigh to yourself. Who are you kidding? Who cares about alarm clocks? Suddenly, a horn snaps you out of your train of thought.<br>\r\n\"Move it kid!\" a driver calls impatiently. \"Are you gonna cross the street or not?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, and scold yourself as you scury across the street. How come you always seemed to do that? Every time something important was happening, you somehow always found yourself daydreaming. Anyway, no time to worry about that now. Only 15 minutes till the appointment, and you still had a couple of blcks to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see a thin space between two buildings. Perfect! A shortcut! You'll be on time for sure now!<br>\r\nAs you approach this alleyway, you notice it seems kind of dark.............. and spooky. Maybe you shouldn't go down the alleyway..............?</span></div></div>",

It is the ONLY way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally you want to move slowly and cautiously, but you know you shouldn't. If you do, going through this place will be in vain.<br>\r\nSo, against your will, you pick up the pace and plunge into the dark alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you skitter by, you see all sorts of things that disgust you. There are rotting cow bones, dirty ashes, old cobwebs, and black lumps of who-knows-what lining the incredibly thin gap between the buildings. And worst of all, there was a certain sort of evil, dark aura in the air that makes every single crack and shadow look like something straight out of a horror movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to lose your cool and sweat forms around your brow. How long have you been in here? How long will it take to get out? What kind of of awful place is this? Is this even human-made? Quickly, you shake your head and take a breather. You just need to calm down and walk a little slower through this nightmare of an alleyway, or you'll lose your cool and never make it to your interview on time......................................right?</span></div></div>",

You've gotta make it to the end! You've just gotta!<br>\r\nSweat starts forming in all sorts of places, and you keep on trucking trough. Where was the end of this stupid alleyway!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep on going, and you feel like your about to die of exauhstion. You just can't seem to reach the exit!<br>\r\nSuddenly, you trip. You fall over on a bone or something, and you just land flat on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there in a daze, and try to get control of your short and gasping breaths. 'no.....................' you moan to yourself. \"NOOOOOO!!\"<br>\r\nYou just lay there with no sense of direction from all of that spinning, and your body aches, probably from banging the concrete so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give out a little whimper, and curl up. Why did you ever think fleeing down this alleyway would do any good? If only you'd known..................<br>\r\nThe darkness in the alleyway seems like a thick wall that's slowly suffocating you to death. You're terrified to death, you're minorly injured, you're trapped in an evil alleyway in a fetal position, and to make things worse, you missed out on breakfast this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curl up even tighter, sweat pouring down your body and your teeth chattering with fear. Did you just hear something? What was that?<br>\r\nThese questions keep on playing through your mind as you curl up tighter and tighter, just wishing you could dissapear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you could curl up so tight that you shrunk down and down, until you were only as big as the bugs on the ground.............. that becomes your deepest wish at the moment. Nothing really matters anymore, just escaping this terrifying place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you curl up into as tiny of a ball you can be, you close your eyes, trying to block out the terrifying darkness.<br>\r\nYou can't think straight, and all you do is wish you could become smaller and smaller. You'd rather be dead than be stuck in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several tense moments of pure horror, you actually start to feel smaller. This makes your spirits sky-rocket, but you still hang on tight- you want to become smaller. Soon, you feel a ton smaller, and and in other words, your confidence is restored. You are still curled up in a small position, but you actually lift up your head and see something- the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, and start inching your way to the exit in your curled up position. It takes a while, but you finally reach the exit.<br>\r\nYou are just about to stand up when you see the trees at a nearby park, and strangely start to feel very hungry all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look at some rotting food at your side, and realize something disturbing- it looks delicious to you too! Your mind becomes somewhat scared and you can only think of how weird everything seems to be right now. You try to be stand up........ but you can't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to panic, you look at your body and realize you've transformed into a-</span></div></div>",
