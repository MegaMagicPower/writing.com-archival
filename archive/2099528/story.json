He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to \u201clook cool?\" Since his mom, Clara, died Alex lives with his Grandparents, George and Evelyn. He is friends with Haley. He is somewhere between 17 - 19 years old. <br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>Appearance:</b></span> <span class=\"cteal\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2e5bYaB\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2e5bYaB</a></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elliot</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliott lives alone in a cabin on the beach.

He\u2019s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working.

It was time that he finally had his way with a woman in Pelican Town, or at least the greater Stardew Valley area.

He could imagine himself violating any of them, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maru</b> had a sort of geeky appeal. She wasn't timid like one might expect of a nerd, however. She was more than confident in her knowledge and expertise in health and nature. If she didn't, she'd make for a pretty terrible nurse. There was something appealing about that nurse aspect of her, though, and she really did seem like the sort who, while confident, was malleable in that aspect, and easy to break. Taking her down a peg would be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Abigail</b> was a bit of a freak. She was nice to just about everyone but her folks, but with them, she had a wild, rebellious streak. She was interested in magic, the occult, and all kinds of kind of nearly gothy things. Her personality didn't really mesh with the way she presented herself physically. Beyond that, she's a bit of a geek. The kind of things she's interested in set her apart from the rest of the villagers, and to Alex, they were frankly a little weird and annoying. Still, punishment would be a fun angle. After all, there was an old saying: The nail that sticks up must be hammered down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily</b> is a cheerful, whimsical girl who seems to jive with nature. She's a little bit on the alternative side, but compared to some of the other eligible peers of Alex's, she's a bit more down to earth. Her optimism is an enticing challenge. She always seems to be smiling. Maybe, just maybe, you could make her see the darker side of nature, and wipe that smile off of her face, while wiping something else entirely onto it. She'd be satisfying to break. Plus, she's Haley's sister, and he's somewhat fond of Haley, while Haley is more than a little hostile towards Emily. Could be a good way to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Haley</b> is probably the most normal and arguably bearable woman in Pelican Town as far as Alex is concerned. She has a clear interest in him, and he could easily fuck her just about whenever he wants, but he's enjoyed playing hard to get for a while. She's a bit of a challenge in that she's incredibly high maintenance, and she does seem to expect Alex to deliver the goods--monetarily and in terms of devotion. He's been playing the game with her for some time, but often thinks of how fun it would be to give her the complete opposite treatment. She wants a man servant for a lover. He secretly wants a slave to use and degrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Leah</b> is an artist who spends a lot of time making a lot of art that Alex finds frankly a little pointless. Beyond her art, though, she tends to sort of stay away from him. Different strokes, one could suppose. A while back, she had a partner named Kel who left her, and she's been a little raw since. Even so, she's a strong, independent woman, and she might be worth the chase. If nothing else, she's hot, and she already gets her hands dirty plenty, so why not her face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Penny</b> is a tragic soul. She's probably by far the easiest to dominate. She's already so submissive, quiet, and sensitive. She works with children, and keeps her nose buried in a book frequently. What's even better is that she's already vastly lower class than Alex. She lives in a shitty trailer with her drunkard mother, who Alex likes to imagine already uses the poor little bitch as a toilet as is. She probably doesn't, of course--all the better, because Alex would love to be the one to cross that line with Penny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>So who will it be?</b></font></span></div></div>",
