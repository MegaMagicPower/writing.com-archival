It didn't help that she was surrounded by those three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up in her bed she looked around the room to see some of the causes of her problem. Blake Belladonna, and her perfect ass the glorious Bellabooty. Yang Xiao Long, who's boobs greet the sun. She breast boobily and titted around. This was how most of Weiss's thoughts on Yang went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up to go to the bathroom Weiss saw the last person she's tormented by. Ruby Rose didn't have anything specifically sexy about her, but Weiss was always more wet when she saw Ruby. Sighing she moved to the bathroom so she could get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had made it through another day of pent up sexual frustration and was going back to the team RWBY dorm when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEEEIIISS!\" Ruby yelled as she sped directly in front of Weiss. \"We have to spare today, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course. I don't know how I forgot.\" Weiss said knowing that she was distracted by all the beautiful women around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made they're way to an empty courtyard on the side of Beacon and begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby charges straight forward with the full might of her semblance and Weiss was preparing a Glyph to counter, when she was distracted by Coco Adel. Watching another source of arousal walk by Weiss's glyph wasn't stopped but came out different. A result she wasn't expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was distracted from her frontal assult by the kind of glyph that her bff made. <i>It's...a spiral...</i> was the last coherent thought that Ruby had before her mind and body stopped looking at the spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Coco gone, Weiss's mind returned to the task at hand and she was surprised to see that she had made a glyph. Another thing that surprised her was that it was a glyph she didn't recognize and it had stopped her partner all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby?\" Weiss asked concerned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes...\" Was all the reply she got.</span></div></div>",

I need to study.\u201d She sat down at her desk and frowned. \u201cWhy do I keep my desk so messy?\u201d She spent a good fifteen minutes carefully organizing everything. \u201cThere, now that my desk is clean.

I need to get a book from the library to finish.\u201d Ruby sighed and stood up. \u201cHope no one else started yet so they actually have a copy.

Ruby was acting like her. Her words came back to her as she thought back to their last encounter. The rune hypnotized her or something and Weiss\u2019 words reprogrammed her somehow. This required more study. Of course, Weiss needed to test this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually researched something I need to try and would love someone as intelligent as you to help out.\u201d Weiss lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can help you out.\u201d Ruby replied, trying to act haughty but had a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed to a private arena and Weiss made sure to lock the door so they wouldn\u2019t be disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did you want to show me?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss conjured the spinning glyph in front of Ruby and the moment Ruby\u2019s eyes stared at it, they glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hear me, Ruby?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026\u201d Ruby responded in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, it worked!\u201d Weiss gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had accidently made a mind control glyph and Ruby was completely under. This had to be explored. Maybe some small tests, but could she contain her excitement? Ruby and her sister Yang always told her she should have some fun. Maybe she could, even if it was at their expense.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss could only assume that means she was receptive to her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt her mouth go dry as she looked up her entranced partner. Weiss had to hold back her... urges for a while now. Would it be wrong to...? Weiss swallowed deciding that it was worth it, at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on,\" Weiss had to force her voice from shaking \"Ruby you will be my... sex friend. A friend who will perform sexual activities with me whenever I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss froze when she saw Ruby stirring, but when she settled back into trance Weiss let out a shaky breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes without saying that you won't tell anyone about it.\" Weiss said \"It's not weird, it's just not worth mentioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss slowly dropped her glyph and watch Ruby carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby woke up and looked around. \"When did we go to the library?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss elected to ignore her partners questions instead posing her own. \"U-unimportant.

There's no need to be nervous Weiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Ruby did kiss Weiss. In fact she started making out with her in the library.

The two of you left the library and headed back to your room. Ruby seemed completely normal but Weiss was incredibly nervous. She had no idea how long the glyph\u2019s mind control would last. Was it permanent or would it wear off? What was the limits? Being an intelligent and organized girl, these questions kept flashing through her mind. However, when Ruby grabbed her hand and pulled her into the empty room, all those questions were pushed from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you want to do it, Weiss?\u201d Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, bed is fine.\u201d Weiss assured her, as she sat down on her bed. She removed her shoes and socks then, slowly and slightly red faced, removed her snow white panties. Then she lifted up her dress and revealed her pussy to Ruby. Before the glyph, Weiss never though this would be possible. \u201cG-go ahead and eat me out. I need release.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, you don\u2019t have to be nervous,\u201d Ruby assured her, kneeling down on the floor. The moment her breath hit Weiss\u2019 lips, she flinched and Ruby grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll make you feel really good Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to it\u2026 oh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby licked Weiss\u2019 lower lips and all words failed her. She wrapped her arms around Weiss\u2019 legs to hold her still as her tongue began to dig deeper into Weiss\u2019 pussy. Weiss fell back on the bed and gripped the sheets as pleasure flooded through her. This was a thousand times better than simple masturbation. The sound of slurping followed by the ripples of pleasure sensation  was a huge turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 Ruby\u2026 more\u2026\u201d Weiss gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slurping intensified and her tongue started moving at super speed. Weiss\u2019 eyes began to roll up in her head. Ruby was using her semblance to speed up her tongue. The sensation was incredible and something Weiss could never have done herself. Weiss couldn\u2019t keep herself holding back under this assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god! I\u2019m\u2026 cumming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt the warm liquid shot out all over Ruby\u2019s face. The tongue assault stopped and Ruby raised her head to look at Weiss. Her tongue licked some of the juices off her lips. Weiss was panting and it took a moment to push herself up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy it?\u201d Ruby asked with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was\u2026 amazing,\u201d Weiss gasped. \u201cHow did you know to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was my first time, so I just wanted to impress you.\u201d Ruby blushed and stood up, looking away. \u201cI got to go meet up with Yang in Vale. I\u2019ll see you later Weiss. Let me know if you ever want to do sex things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss laid on the bed thinking what to do next. Yang and Ruby would be gone for a few hours, so she had time to try out the glyph some more. A devious grin formed on her face. With this glyph, all of her sexual desires could be satisfied, perverted or otherwise. Of course, she could use it for revenge on people. All those months of Yang teasing her for having small breasts for example. Though, right now, she probably should keep testing the Glyph and figure out what all it was capable of.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A perfect girl for someone like Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good thirty minutes to find her, but Weiss found her in the locker rooms.

Coco followed the moving glyph and once they were in a training room, Weiss locked the door. \u201cOooo, I can\u2019t wait to examine the body.\u201d She licked her lips as she looked Coco up and down. \u201cWhat would be the most entertaining way?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would love to have even one of them fuck her, but who knows how they'll respond to that? Luckily she has a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Glyphs. While training she found out how to make a glyph that will put anyone into a hypnotic trance. She immediately starts planing on how to turn her team and every other sexy girl in the school into her sex slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) Good grammer. I'll allow you some typos but if a chapter is incomprehensable, I'll delete it.<br>\r\n2) I can add rules later if I think of any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave Fun</td>",
