It was called \"Il Pollo che Arde,\" and they served Italian food. You were too small to be a waiter or a chef, so you were a chef's assistant. You did several small things around the kitchen, and you do mean small - picking up bits of salt and pepper, chopping garlic into very small cloves, etc. They kept you on a small ledge above one of the stoves. While some people had protested your working in such an environment, you do have to say the owners arranged it well, and you had never ended up in a food dish or gotten accidentally swallowed, not even once. However, that might change soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife drove up to the restaurant and carried you to the kitchen. She said goodbye, then left for her own job. As you waited on the ledge, you smelled the fumes of marinara sauce and other stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the chef who watched over you came over to the ledge. Her name was Hannah. She was 30 years old, and African-American. She wore an apron over a t-shirt, jeans, and boots. She regarded you mainly as a coworker but she also helped you a lot of the times. Sometimes you could tell she had a mild lust for you, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you doing today?</span></div></div>",

But you were a man; a grown man married with children; like it or not you were going to have to spend the day doing things. Thankfully your size ruled out most physical chores, but that simply meant you had to make up for it twice over in the emotional department. Dealing with any issue anyone in the house had was your job; like it or not. But maybe you could get lucky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should spend the day with Ingrid honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"Fuck\" </i> Then again, maybe not. \"She's a big girl; I don't think she needs it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael looked concerned, \"I think she's jealous, since you spent all of last weekend with Morgan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She threw me <i> in </i> her shoe!!

Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" You groaned. Highschool was....interesting. A bunch of confused experimental teens and a near microscopic boy...not the best pairing. And oddly enough over half of the stuff they did involved their feet...weird...maybe some association with bugs and feet or something. You just knew it wasn't natural for some girl to, out of the blue, ask for Foot Worship, but you've seen it happen multiple times. But thankfully; Ingrid was the better of your daughters...granted ever since this whole \"Goth\" stuff started she's been rougher, she still didn't play with you...<i> too </i> much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized Rachael was awaiting an answer and you looked at her, \"Sure, could ya give me a lift?\" Rachael did, right to her lips. One intoxicating kiss later you found yourself in Ingrid's room, man your wife could multi-task! With a wink she left; you being in too much of a lovey daze to really notice anything else for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight beside the dresser you were on sat a bed, on the bed sat your lovely daughter Ingrid. Ingrid was a beautiful girl, more than any guy deserved in your opinion, but since she entered this phase....it's been looking like she's been dressing the wrong way. Slightly revealing tight black outfits, lots of leather...it was worriesome. But that was why you were there; Dad to the rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there honey...you okay?\" At that moment a paranoia came to mind, Rachael...<i> did </i> tell Ingrid you were there...right? Ingrid wasn't a fan of surprised, and given the increased rough housing, her apparent jealousy, and hatred of surprised. If she found you....things might not look too good. And that didn't even come close to approaching the fact that if she didn't know you were there....even the slightest breath could spell certain doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"Please dear god let her know I'm here.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INGRID!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid....</span></div></div>",

I heard that some of the stores just opened and I really wanna check it out.\" It was rare for Ingrid to want to go to some place as socially alive as a mall. Hell yeah it was okay! But to maintain the \"Dad\" persona you simply shrugged, \"It sounds fine, but why do you need me?\" Ingrid averted her gaze in embarrassment, \"Well...I try not to ask but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take rocket science to figure it out, \"Ahh...money.\" Ingrid nodded, and you couldn't stop the smile from forming on your lips. \"Alright, you know the drill.\" A sound of agreement came whilst Ingrid was fishing in her purse, eventually pulling out a silver credit card. \"I carry the card due to your size and you mutter the number code to me. Right?\" Ever like Ingrid, never missed a beat and the heart of an angel. \"That's right, good thing you remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid smiled widely at the praise, \"Thank you Daddy! You okay with hitching a ride in the usual place?\" The \"Usual Place\" for Ingrid was her ear, so she could hear you and you weren't particularly suffering. Now if it was Morgan...ho boy...some of the places make you learn for hell in her pocket or something. But thankfully luck handed you the good daughter tonight. \"Yeah it works, when do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now.\" Ingrid flatly replied. In a single leap of her bed you heard her barefeet slam on the floor with enough force to make you cringe. Not that Ingrid noticed, with a couple sways of her nice curves she strode her way to a pair of solid black boots. Ugh, simply staring at them brought flashbacks of worse days...goth kids in school... preps with their expensive boots...Rouge....horrible times. Thankfully though Ingrid wasn't like any of them; albeit with the boots, the revealing black tanktop, and thigh level black shorts she could've easily passed for a Mini-Rouge. That was another thing about this goth phase you disliked, simply looking at your daughter reminded you of the Devil...and to make things worse ever since entering this phase Rouge has been like her idol....can you say \"Bad Influence?\" Thankfully Rouge's moves in that regard didn't seem to fare too well, but a corner of your mind worried about it day in and out. Not even beginning to mention the bad friends Ingrid began to make, kids who would probably grow up to be crooks; and while with them Ingrid seemed to have less morals then usual. As a father it was really worriesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you knew Ingrid's fingernail had you scooped up and heading towards her ear. You were so lost in your nostalgic trauma you nearly left reality for a minute, but you were back; right in time to climb off and in the cave of her ear. You didn't go far, only a few feet before sitting down in a cozy little ridge. All ready and with Daddy on her side Ingrid was off (After explaining to Mom of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got permission to borrow Rachael's car for the ride so your giant daughter was behind the wheel before the conversations out of boredom began. Just mild small talk, nothing particularly important. You were being Dad, stuck in your out-of-date ways, and Ingrid was putting up with it with a kind hearted smile. Luckily, being in a car made the trip a hundred times shorter. In no time flat you had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away you began to shop with Ingrid, going to a Bookstore, and weapon store (Only browsing), and one or two clothing shops. It was a real blast and every time you said yes to a request you were \"Super Dad\" , it felt nice, it really did. But the closer the light was, the greater the shadow. Ingrid had walked into Hot Topic when she ran into a group of people you did <i> NOT </i> want either of you to be around...</span></div></div>",

Ingrid was a good girl, but lately in her gothic phase, she had come across 'friends' that you didn't entirely approve of. A group of girls who shared her darker tastes, but were completely on the other side of the personality spectrum. Ingrid was sweet and considerate, while her friends were on par with the devil herself, Rouge. There were a total of three, Sadie, Mei, and Florence. Sadie was the most tolerable, often neutral in ignoring you unless the others pressured her to mess with you. Mei, a rather cute japanese girl, was the one you found the most annoying. She laughed all the <i>FRIGGIN'</i> time. Florence, the undisputed leader of them, was the most sadistic, but took it easy on you since Ingrid was your daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time you had met them, which you dubbed the terrible threesome, Ingrid had invited them over for dinner. Up in your eldest daughter's room, she had introduced you to them. Almost instantly you were subjected to their 'games'. Sadie had you dropped into her boot, and left you to explore it the whole night. Ingrid won in the end though, convincing her to release you back to her. You loved that girl!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ingrid!!\"Sadie's voice broke your train of thought. You felt your giant daughter's body lurch in the direction of the despised voice. They proceeded to chat about school and such, mostly boring topics. Mei's laughter rang in the background the whole time.\"Aren't goths supposed to be gloomy?!\"You mumbled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Ingrid had been sucked into their group. They left Hot Topic and proceded to walk over the whole mall. After two hours, Ingrid had decided to head back home.\"Bye guys! Me and my Dad have to get back soon. I'll see you at school though.\"Ingrid said to them, about to walk out to the parking lot before Florence grabbed her arm.\"Wait...your Dad's here?\"She took on a amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"Ingrid shrugged.\"He's right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could object, she dug her finger into her ear, obtaining you on her index finger. Bright light and titanic objects greeted you as she held you out to show you to her friends.\"Say hi, Daddy!!\"Ingrid said cheerfully. You cross your arms, giving a half-hearted shout to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlorence's maliciously grinning face peered down at you.\"Hey Ingrid...\"She began.</span></div></div>",

To the point it might've blown your cover anyway, better to lie and wait. But for reassurance you did secure yourself behind some cartilage. Between these two Goth's you would rather be in Ingrid's boot every day for the rest of your life rather than spend a single day with Rouge; that was how terrible she was. From your hiding spot you could see Rouge's shadow in the distance...man you wished that was all that was there. But of course; the one who owned the shadow stood before your daughter, talking happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...hows ol tiny doing? My toe's just haven't felt the same since they held him last time.\" Rouge let out a hearty laugh with her seductively deep voice. God just hearing it seemed arousing...but all Rouge's beauty amounted to absolutely NO soul. The woman was a walking demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid's insides cringed at the way Rouge was talking, she admired Rouge a lot. She could stand up to any man, make them drop with just a look. She could <i> have </i> any man she wants, she was beyond beautiful and brought gothic beauty to untold levels. She was almost a goddess of a role model, and at the same time Ingrid was disgusted by her. Disgusted by her treatment of you; aside from that she seemed like a good person. And yet at the same time someone Ingrid would never want to cross...it was hard to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? He's been well thank you. He's been busy with me and Morgan a lot though; Mom seems happy regardless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's eyes lit up a bit, not that you could tell, call it a disturbance in the Force...\"Oh? Busy you say? Do explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" This was not the time for spilling her guts! Not with you in her ear! She knew this and could feel you perking up; this was a Dad's chance here. \"Well...I've become Goth recently as you know. And he just worries about me, it's kind of...irritating and bothers me but I'll be fine. And Morgan just does nothing but torture him, not even a week ago she tossed him in her shoe for days!\" Ingrid felt relieved; a satisfactory answer without giving her Dad too much either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge laughed a little bit, \"Ah...classic Morgan. But Ingrid...\" Her hands grabbed the young girl, \"If you're Dad  bothers you, just let Auntie Rouge know okay? I have ways of making him see how he was wrong. Or if you want, just toss him in your sock or boot for a while. Feels great, soaks up some sweat, and he learns a lesson. Three birds with one stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid let out a nervous laugh; \"Okay, I'll keep that in mind...I'm sorry Rouge but I really have to go. I promised Mom I'd be home in time to help with dinner an-\" Ingrid was in the midst of trying to walk away, but Rouge's hand found her shoulder quicker than you can believe. \"Nice try dearie, but you need to work on your lying a bit more. Now get Daddy out of your ear so I can see him please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> SHIT </i> Rouge knew you were there! Damn she was smart and observant, why did the evil have to be so talented!? Ingrid was clearly wondering the same thing as a finger came to her ear; reluctantly you hopped down. And found yourself in a never ending plain of Ingrid's hand and it's wrinkles, beyond were the five pillars of her fingers, and even further past that were the two God-like beings of Ingrid and Rouge; each so big that above their chest they seemed fuzzy at the edges. Hell you could hardly SEE Rouge's face past her enormous breasts, but you did see her demented smirk and boy did it scare you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt over so her face was at Ingrid's palm; normal people would have to squint to see you, but another of Rouge's unreal talents was her eyesight; she seemed to instinctively know where you were at all times (Which may be how she found you actually...) and also possessed the ability to see you clearly without even trying. Of all people it just had to be her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, hey there tiny. Remember your Mistress?\" Your nervous backing away was all the answer she needed, or wanted for the matter. Rouge's eyes batted to Ingrid who, looked as if she would faint. \"Relax dearie; and don't try anything, at his size your Dad might not make it; plus while I may be a bit rough; I won't hurt him. I just want him to understand you a bit better...I mean well, honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sounded unsure; \"I...guess you would know...Aunt December says nothing but good stuff about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> BUT DAD SAYS NOTHING BUT BAD!!!!!!\" </i> You shouted to the heavens, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you didn't buy it; but it looked like Ingrid just might have. She was definitely hesistant at the least, not good. Rouge seemed to sense she was weak; \"Trust me dearie; I know what's best. By the end of this you'll be closer to your Dad than ever; I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smirked, \"Now, I know this will be rough to do but I want you to....</span></div></div>",

Now hand him over.\"<br>\r\n\"Promise?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'll use him for just one night.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Here he comes.\" With that Ingrid tilted her hand ever so slightly. For you, this meant having your whole world turned to the side. As the walls of Ingrid's hand went sideways, you fell down and down, and you didn't think it would end...until you landed on a patch of paler skin. This was Rouge's hand. Now there was no escape.<br>\r\n\"Bye now,\" Rouge said as Ingrid walked away. Then she turned her attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my tiny slave, it's too bad I couldn't get you for longer.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the midst of your angry (And slightly scared) parenting Morgan simply let go of you. You were so used to your size at this age that you had forgotten that falling at about any place would result in your death, but now you remembered; just in time for gravity to run its course. You looked into the mischievous gaze of your daughter as her already ungodly large face grew farther and farther away, only increasing the sheer audacity of her presence. You fell twenty-thirty feet before you landed, much much sooner than you expected but who gave a damn? The soft surface you landed on saved your life. All around you saw light faded blue for miles, and above a giant arch seemed to cross the heavens. Reminded you a bit of Halo actually...and then you started piecing it together. Blue, arch, soft cushiony ground.....you were on Morgan's sandal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the hand that held the footwear nearly neck level back up to Morgan's brimming smile. You started yet another angry parent rant but Morgan quickly shut it down with her much louder, more intimidating voice. She made no attempts to lower her voice, nearly bursting your eardrums. \"Teehee, looks like my flip-flop saved your life daddy. Sounds to me like you owe it, and its owner some gratitude. Don't worry I know just how you can make it up.\" You felt chills up your spine as Morgan's face grew farther and farther away, soon her face was partially clouded by her breasts, which even though they only started already seemed too big to you. Then her waist rose above you, until finally you and the sandal were on the wooden floor, Morgan's face almost a blurr from the sheer distance between you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that had nothing on what was to come, fearfully you looked at the bare toes Morgan was flexing, painted Azure to match her favorite flip-flops, and tapping along the floor to create light booms for your ears. To your miniature eyes you easily made out the little things like small beads of foot sweat (She had a slight problem with that) and little beads of old dirt and sock lint. Experience told you what was about to come, and boy you called it. The monolithic toes that you would barely be able to climb in a week was coming your way, along with a playful chuckle from Morgan above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfectly theatrical Morgan drew out her foot's entrance, slowly sliding it over her flip-flop, but not allowing her sole to touch the sweat absorbent leather just yet. Her toes had just passed the \"Arch\" and fully entered the sandal before she addressed you again. \"Now Daddy, I don't want you to still feel indebted to my feet after this so would you please kiss my foot while your with it? It <i> did </i> save your life after all so I don't think it'll  be a problem.\" If Morgan wasn't your daughter you probably would've shouted some curses, maybe even make a break for it. But past experiences always showed the latter didn't work. Still, your daughter's \"Pranks\" did get tiresome, always some kind of angle to it. Like a chair would save your life from a fall (which she caused), she would claim you owed her butt and would sit on you. Occasionally she even just went with the much easier \"I'm a goddess and you're a bug act.\" and sometimes she even just went and did something wordlessly. It was almost like she was roleplaying with it; sad to say you were the victim in these roleplays...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not here come's the hero of the hour!\" About thirty yards above Morgan's foot began it's descent towards her sandal. Almost heroically you stood your ground and looked at the incoming mass. This wouldn't be the first time you were underfoot, Rouge, December, Morgan, Melly and even your own mother had each done it at one point or another. You would live, you'd be under a 100 tons of pressure, soaked it foot sweat and probably smell, but you'd live. Mere moments later Morgan's foot overcame you, capturing you right beneath the ball of her foot. Nearly instantaneously you caught the odor of feet in your nostrils as sweat already seemed into your clothing. It was a familiar sensation but that didn't mean you had to like it any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if having you suffer at her feet wasn't enough Morgan poured some salt into the wounds, \"Why I don't feel any kissing! It's okay Daddy, don't be shy. Your savior deserves a reward doesn't she?\" Grumbling you did as you were expected, as humiliating as it may have been you began to kiss your daughter's sole. If being an adult taught you anything it was humility, that didn't make it any easier though. Of course Morgan laughing it up miles above didn't exactly help neither.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weightless sensation of floating told you she had begun walking, succeeding in sliding you further into the wrinkles of her sole whilst she did the natural walking motions. It hurt like the sun itself had fallen on you, but you knew Morgan was taking it easy, why? Mom. Rachael would easily piece it together if she had just left her husband with Morgan and Morgan was leaving, so she had to be stealthy about it. Cautiously Morgan sidled her way to the front door, so far no one was around (To your dismay and her joy), All she had to do was open the door and she was home free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously Morgan bit her lip and grabbed the door handle, turning it ever so slowly...</span></div></div>",

Facing her big sister, Ingrid. \"Well; just decided to go out for a walk. Maybe visit a friend.\" Nervous sweat started forming at Morgan's various body parts, sad to say her feet were included. Nothing you weren't accostomed to though, and it made a great lubricant. Beneath Morgan's massive foot you used your sweat covered body to slide from beneath it. Soon you were right between her big and second toes; looking up at your daughters in the stand off of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid smirked at Morgan, \"Oh? Well why don't I come along then? Gotta look out for family you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nervous backaway step by Morgan, fatal mistake. \"Nah it's okay, I really don't want to burden you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Ingrid stepped forward, \"Because you're embarrassed to be around your pretty goth sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the window Morgan wanted, \"...Yeah! Sor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or because you have Dad with you and don't want me to catch you?\" The air froze up, Morgan petrified and Ingrid smiling victoriously. \"You really have to work on your poker face, even if Mom didn't tell me ahead of time. You have to be one of the worst liars I've met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusted, you knew it, Ingrid knew it, and Morgan knew it; no use holding up the facade anymore. \"So what if I did? At his size being a good toy is about all he's good for. Beside's I saved his life; he owes me.\" The sudden dark tone Morgan was speaking with shocked Ingrid and you beyond belief. Especially you, it was like your daughter held no love for you...or maybe she was a much better liar than granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid regained herself quick though; \"Yeah, you saved him from something <i> you </i> caused. Seems to me like if anything you owe him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan snorted, \"Please; I bless him with my presence! He loves me; not just because I'm his daughter, but because I <i> am </i> his goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sentence that shocked you and Ingrid, \"Please! You're just making excuses now, give him back this instant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if Ingrid had won the conflict, but Morgan reacted quite differently than expected. \"What about when he went missing for three days? Fell into one of your boots?\" The sudden question drew a confused look from the elder sister. \"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You telling me you didn't enjoy that at all? That your feet didn't feel better with him beneath them like a bug? It didn't give you a power rush that you'd never wanna give up for anything?\" Morgan took a step forward, Ingrid a step back; this was <i> not </i> a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you trying to convince? Me or you? You loved it, you know you did. You just don't wanna admit it; because it means you're no better than me. But it's the truth, we both know it. He's just a bug meant to please us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan Morgan shook things up! You were horrified at how effective her tactics were; at this rate BOTH your daughters were going to be torturing you! You had to do something. But...Morgan seemed to realize where you were, and in a single motion her big toe held you flat beneath it's mountainous mass. Naturally you attempted to push; lift it up, nothing came from your fruitless efforts. You were pinned beneath the sweaty toe of Morgan while she played mindgames with Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what? The truth? Here's the secret Ingrid, it is. He's just a bug for our pleasure. That's all he ever was; Mom's told us stories of when he was our age. People knew it back then too. It's the truth. Come on Ingrid...we can play with our toy together. Feet, butt, whatever. We can do it as sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a development! You could not believe your ears, in mere minutes Morgan completely changed the entire situation! But there was no way Ingrid would agree to this....would she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid appeared uncertain of the words coming from her mouth, \"Well....</span></div></div>",

She pulled up the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight sweetie!\" She said as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight honey!\" You screamed back at her, hoping she could hear. You settled into your tiny bed, fully prepared to hit the hay for a good night's rest. It was completely dark in the room, and everything was quiet. Too quiet. You were beginning to have thoughts about maybe beging to hard on Morgan. Little did you know what was about to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying asleep in your bed for a hour or two, you heard a soft noise. It almost sounded like the door creeping open. You heard what sounded like soft footsteps approaching. You thought maybe it was just Ingrid coming in to ask you a question. She knew it would be all right, as Rachael was the heavyiest sleeper you knew. She could sleep through anything. The person drew nearer, and you were just about to say hello to whoever it was, when you were snatched up by a powerful set of hands. The person yanked you out of bed and gripped you so hard, you thought they would kill you. You began to panic. You screamed and shouted, but Rachael would never hear you. Your captor pushed down on your head with their finger to silence you. They took you out into the hallway and closed the door behind them. In the faint light of the hallway, you saw who it was. It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan!\" You yelled. \"What do you think you're doing!\" She stared at you, unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb with me bug.\" Morgan's voice was cold and harsh. Did she just call you bug? \"I'm getting my revenge for what you did earlier. You'll pay for that you insignificant nothing.\" Her words stung. What had happened to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan! Put me down right now! I'm sure we can talk this through...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Not this time...dad.\" The way she said dad was full of hate. \"I'm making sure no one ever finds you again.\" You gasped. She sounded so serious. This wasn't the first time Morgan had threatened to kill you. Several years ago, she had gotten so mad that she had eaten you! Ingrid saw her do, it managed to make Morgan throw you back up. You didn't want to go through that experience again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Morgan! Don't do anything to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Look at how it begs.\" It? \"But don't worry, I won't be doing anything.\" With that, Morgan carried you into Ingrid's room. She silently slid the door open and tiptoed inside. Ingrid was fast asleep. She was just as a heavy sleeper as Rachael was, but at least you knew where she got it. Morgan carried you up to something bin like beside Ingrid's bed. It was Ingrid's clothes bin, and it was full of clean clothes! Morgan knelt down, and moved you over the bin. Then she dropped you. You plummeted what felt like miles, until you smacked onto a hard surface. The pain shot up your body, but thankfully no bones broke. Morgan looked down at you, and smiled the evilest smiled you had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you NEVER dad.\" She whispered, and left the room. It was then that you realized where you were.

She was home free and before it could be ruined she stepped right outside. Morgan couldn't help but let out a happy sigh as the warm air of Spring came to her, not too hot like it was in the Summer, not too cold like Winter, it was just the right temperature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps through Morgan was soon out of sight of the house, and as soon as she was she started stretching; to any passerby it would look relatively normal.

But you did remember that they didn't have too many qualms about playing with you at Morgan's birthday, or at least, if they had any they didn't show it and decided fitting in took priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan giggled a little bit, \"Oh yeah, you're a little busy down there. Not that I can hear you anyway. Just wanted to let you in on what was going on, and by the way. If you get thirsty or hungry...I'm sure my feet will be kind enough to help you out. I hear sweat is real good for you, not to mention sock lint. No need to thank me; just knowing I can help you like this is enough for me.\" To your dismay you recognized the base movements of her feet as Morgan standing back up to full height, and starting her walk to the beach; and it was going to be a long....<i> long </i> walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your age it wasn't anything new, being underfoot in a sandal; but that didn't mean you enjoyed it in any sense. The foot itself seemed to sweat far more than people generally noticed...but you did, and sock lint and toejam...yeah memories weren't too fond in that department either. Then there was walking...at least ten minutes to ten hours of rising in the air, feeling like all weight was lifted from your body....Only to slam against the bare sole as the foot goes down, and once it kicks back up the process repeated. All together it was harsher than most roller coasters, luckily you had a small lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM! All of a sudden instead of the average footstep that made you suffer this next one was a stomp! What the hell was Morgan playing at? This was odd; even for her! That one single stomp held enough force to break bones! Lucky for you you had one tough ass body, sort of like God's way for compensating, small as ant, hard as hell to kill. But still...this was dangerous! You already couldn't move you were so deeply ingrained in Morgan's sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext step...maybe it was a mishap...BAM!! Nope, wasn't an accident. Morgan was stomping your miniscule body deeper into her sweaty sole and you hadn't the faintest idea why. Or at least, at first you didn't, but it came back in a second. Morgan wanted you to continue kissing her sole like before...ugh. With a sigh your lips puckered and you started, more or less, making out with your daughter's foot. Just in time for the next step...and no stomp. Looks like you were able to appease your God-sized daughter...for now. Aside from getting squished deep into what you thought was a wrinkle of Morgan's sole you seemed relatively fine, a tad sweat soaked, maybe slightly smelly...but okay. Morgan seemed happy enough too, but you knew once you arrived at the beach things would only get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if on cue...at that moment guess where you arrived? The beach, and Morgan already had a fun day planned for her, and a miserable one for you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a stern expression marked with faint signs of blushing your mother began bringing her hand towards her rather well endowed chest, Even in the latter half of her lifetime your mother was still extremely attractive; enough that even you caught the occasional perverted thought regarding her. But you were a man of integrity, you would not demean your mother and all her hard work with thoughts like that. But damn it all if this situation didn't make it tough. As the twin moons that were Karen's breasts began to edge closer and closer you could feel your heart skip a beat or two. It wasn't just out of some arousal, but also out of some fear as well. Your mother....well when she got like this she had a tendency to do a few things; one of them was get extremely moody, which when you left only got worse, and the other was treat you like you were a child again. Nurturing you, caring, placing you in certain areas, and on occasion...punishing you. Just from memory alone you knew what was to come; and you were right. In a quick motion Karen's hand turned over, and gravity plummetted you into the vastness of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you would live relatively unharmed but it didn't stop the instinctive screams as you fell, nor did it help reduce your blushing once you landed on the cusion of her bosom. After a couple bounces (from your landing) in the cleavage canyon you found yourself positioned right at the V of her cleavage, holding on to both breasts so you wouldn't fall or bounce around any further. It was amazing that even now when you were at your mother's chest you still caught next to no signs of aging, even at your size you had yet to spot a wrinkle along the smooth continent of her breast. Her soft....warm....embraceful....\"No!!\" You shook your head to get those kind of thoughts out. Took a little while but it really went away quick when you saw above in the sky, your Mom's fingers joined together coming towards her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply placing each hand on her breasts, Karen's fingers touched you in what was as close to a hug as you could possibly recieve from her. \"There there baby...it'll be okay. I know you're scared but it's okay, Mommy will never hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Stop this! I'm not a child anymore! I have a wife...a family! I have to take care of them!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtrodinarily loud shushing got rid of any chance of you being heard, \"Ssh.....do you hear it dear? The sound of my heart beats? I want you as close to my heart as possible, can you hear it's love for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter focusing for a moment you actually could hear it, the familiar rhythm of Karen's heart beating...it was almost soothing. The beats seemed to be tuned to your name at times. It was almost enough to make you enjoy your position, here at your Mom's voluptous cleavage...almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!! Please stop this!! I have to get home to the kids!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren almost sounded like a kid herself the way she replied, \"No! You're going to be with me for a nice....<i> long </i> time. I might even be able to get December to come over for a few days...we can be a family again...\" You realized it many times but....Karen was really lonely. The kids were all she had, no husband, not even a boyfriend. And two of the kids were gone...a part of you couldn't blame her for acting like this fairly often. But the rest of you...Did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to struggle against the continental fingers and even bigger breasts, even the slightest inch of movement would be your salvation. But it was like an Ant moving a mountain, absolutely no effect. \"We still are a family Mom!! We just leave the nest time to time!! We still love you to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mother didn't even show signs of recieving those words, \"Maybe I should call December...tell her we can hang out like the old days....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was not a good sign, December was dumb...and in this situation she would be the last person you'd want to see because of that. With Mom the way she was at the moment she'd probably end up getting December to act like she was a kid again...hell you almost were and you had kids! And if December did get that far....well let's just say when you were growing up she wasn't exactly sister of the year. And an older Melly was around too....god three women who would likely end up toying with you. This was not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what we should do...\"</span></div></div>",

From your perspective you had no idea what was going on; other than the fact your Mom was on the move. All you could see was her face from a lower birdseye perspective and the ceiling beyond that, nothing about the actual layout of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit; you were worried. Whenever Mom got like this...well things got a tad troublesome. Her logic will begin to have some flaws here and there, she'll act a little odd too...maybe suddenly shout then hold you nostalgically...maybe even demand tasks like a foot rub or something. To be quite frank; at times it was like your Mom had lost her marbles, which is often how parents are around children that have left the nest but in normal cases the child has the ability to stand up to their parent at that time; your size not only prevented that, but basically made you Karen's toy. Nervous sweat began to build up as the thoughts crossed your mind, or maybe it was the warmth of being trapped against your Mom's bosom...hard to tell, probably both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> KCH-INK. </i> The sound of a door shutting...wherever Karen wanted to take you, you were there. Above you looked towards her face, she looked at you for a brief moment too. But before words could be uttered a smile crossed her lips and Karen's face vanished behind what appeared to be a red sky...it was her shirt! She was taking her shirt off! The red \"sky\" soon no longer covered your Mom's face, instead it was above her, and now light seemed to be coming from below. The edge of your Mother's bra brushed along the shirt as it rose, slightly uplifting the breasts enough to squish you slightly...but in a moment it was over. Light flooded from everywhere, soon the white bra that held your Mother's lovely mammeries was in broad light, as were you; it was almost blinding for a moment, but your eyes weren't what you needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dear, while we're in my room I figured we could do some nice bonding...no one makes my body feel as nice as you do...\" A confused grunt came out of you, what the hell was Karen talking about? \"My feet...breasts...butt...no one seems to make them feel better than you.\" Now it sorta made sense, Karen was talking about how at your size...you did a great job with jobs such as massages. Although the way she phrased it was kind of odd...then again there was Mom's mental state...can't blame her really. Was kinda sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what to do...she seemed to sit on something, which, judging from some springing noises, was her bed. \"My toe nails could use a really could cleaning...but no one does better with my nipples...maybe you could help me with some ear wax...or maybe even my teeth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" You're Mom acted like this before but never this extreme! She was talking almost as bad as Rouge! Man she was bad today...and of course this would be the day you get stuck with her. Grunted noises of thinking disrupted you as your Mother bit her lip, man she was actually serious about this! One of her fingers came out of nowhere and seemed to push you into her breast, \"While I think can you give me a few kisses? For Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded more like asking a slave instead of a child but you complied; thank god it was only her breast. Kissing feet always sucked and got sweat in your mouth; but Mom's breast? Nice...smooth...soft, not a bead of sweat...hell you kinda liked it. Wait...what?! You had to shake your head, this was your Mom dammit!! But still...kissing the large tan mountain was just....you shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon your Mom finally called out for you; \"Okay I decided!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As these words came out Karen's expression showed none of the emotions you expected; embarrassment, confusion, apprehension, that kind of stuff. The only feeling evident on her face was a perverse happiness, was she really so far gone she didn't realize exactly what she was doing? It seemed like it; but doing something like this...it just wasn't right. She was your Mom for christs sake! Getting aroused at times was perfectly natural given your size and gender but she wasn't supposed to encourage things like that!! You knew it might've been futile, hell it could worsen everything, but you had to say something. \"Mom I refuse!! Not just because I'm a human being but because I am your son! I won't do this!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the reactions you expected Karen chose the one you did not, she laughed. \"So funny, it's okay baby. You misunderstand, I'm just having a rough day and I need a quick pick-me-up; that's all this is. This isn't...incest or anything. I love you but not like that, this is purely for the pleasure. \"Sounds like incest to me...\" You grumbled. <i> CLICK CLICK </i> Miles behind your Mother's back you heard the distinct sound of her undoing her bra. In a single moment the restrictions towards Karen's  breasts seemed to vanish entirely, leaving her nipples exposed to the open world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs disturbing as the idea was; this wasn't your first time seeing your Mom's chest like this. And even though that was true you were always awe struck just by the sight. Over the twenty some-odd years you had lived you had grown more than accostumed to your size, and yet almost every day of your life you were awestruck by such simple things. Like the fact Morgan's toenail could literally be an entire city for you, or that if you ever found yourself lost in Ingrid's boot how you might as well be an ant on a dark planet, how every time Rachael kisses you, a wrinkle of her puckered lips threatens to swallow you into it's depths. It wasn't just something no one could imagine, literally everything imaginable was larger than you. A speck of dirt on someone's sock, ten times your size. Some grime between teeth, at least double. Just the idea that all this was literally nothing to the giants around you was awerendering. Fate was fortunate in that your family seemed to be have adjusted enough to see you fairly clearly though, a diamond among the crap you dealt with. But even though all this was stuff you dealt with on a daily basis the sight of Karen's nipple just rendered you speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink mound of flesh with it's abundance of wrinkles was like a mountain to you, a mountain the required hours to climb; and it wasn't even hard yet! Almost instintively a finger rose to brush your own nipple, it was nothing but maybe an inch to you; and yet the same body part was before you and larger than a hundred people. Just another awe-filled moment for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awe you felt was shattered in an instant by the sound of what could loosely be called whispers. \"Come on baby, go ahead and make Mommy proud.\" You hardly registered it when a fingernail came from the heavens. Oddly reckless of your Mom she had hardly given you enough time to even grab ahold of it before she brought it to her nipple. That short two seconds you were literally hanging for your life off of her fingernail, more than happy to get off despite the fact Karen brought you to her nipple. Almost nervously you glanced at your Mom once more; praying she was joking, her expression said she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you gaze came to the surface you stood on, simply amazing. You were standing atop a mountain, a mountain you could literally worship for a week straight and hardly cover any space on it. A mountain that had wrinkles large enough for you to fall into here and there. A mountain that was naught but a spot on the planet...no... more like the universe that was your Mother. You knew Karen would force you to do something if you remained still so weakly you got down on your stomach, and simply rubbed yourself against the soft skin. The effects were almost instantaneous, Mom let out a moan of pleasure, her nipple seemed to harden a bit, and your face turned a nice shade of red. It was a start, but both you and Karen knew it would take far more than that. The question was...how far would you be willing to go? Self control would only go so far before endorphins and testerone kicked in, and then you would likely lose all sorts of control. You shuddered at the thought, you would very likely end up losing yourself sexually in Karen's nipple. And if somehow you did maintain your cool it was probably worse, if she desired it your Mom would make you surrender yourself to her anyway. The only difference between that and the other method is that this one would be far more humiliating and you would hate every second of the forced pleasure. You were just thankful to god you had clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, that was nice but....your clothes kinda make it itchy. I know it's tough but...can you take them off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> Shit </i>\" You cursed both verbally and mentally. At this point you knew better than to go against the unstoppable force of a regular sized person, but it didn't make what you were doing any easier. With a pained look you removed your clothes and cast them aside, where they would likely be lost forever. A glimpse between your legs worried you, not to go into detail but...your <i> \"Friend\" </i> was happy. You eyed the never ending expansion of nipple before you, would you manage to maintain yourself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the hardest thing for a Man to do; to simply see a nipple the size of God and not act on raw sexual impulse. Were you still a child there was no doubt you would have succumbed as fast as possible, but you were an adult...and managed to weakly hold yourself back. Signs of your internal struggle were painfully obvious, legs wobbling, eyes twitching a little; even your foot was tapping quite a bit. But somehow you retained yourself. The attraction of your Mother was still there\u2026but at least you weren\u2019t going nuts for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren saw you naked and prodded you slightly with her finger, \u201cGood boy, now do Mommy a favor and rub your entire body against my nipple\u2026it just feels amazing.\u201d Right away you had fallen face first against the pink flesh, not out of desire or obeying orders\u2026but even a small prod from your Mother pushed you to the floor. It wasn\u2019t a particularly rough fall\u2026but\u2026well a certain part of your body brushed against it a certain way\u2026and it gave you Goosebumps to say the least. You let out a small moan from the physical pleasure\u2026as did Karen, hard to believe at your size you had that kind of effect but\u2026well a girl only got that vocal when aroused. The ground beneath you started to grow rigid\u2026not rock hard or anything but\u2026hard enough if you fell again it would hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you had hardly even begun, you knew your Mom and Karen wanted more\u2026you could practically hear her blood rushing at the thought. So with slight dismay you rubbed your whole body against her again, and again you let out a small moan alongside Karen. Again you did it\u2026the pleasure much sharper this time, to avoid letting out a much louder, more embarrassing moan you tightened your hands on her nipple\u2026that may have helped you bite your tongue but it made Karen aroused enough for the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026More\u2026more son\u2026please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose weren\u2019t the words you wanted to hear, mainly because you were close enough, and Karen\u2019s eyes had adjusted enough, that she could see you relatively fine. She could tell if you weren\u2019t doing as she said\u2026so you had to do it. Again you rubbed your groin against her nipple, this time purposely gripping her nipple flesh for her pleasure, as well as to bite your tongue again. You even threw in a short kiss for good measure, big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026don\u2019t stop with that\u2026don\u2019t hold back\u2026now!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was starting to sweat\u2026was she getting wet from this? Even orgasmic maybe? What happened to no incest!? She was losing all sorts of control! Thankfully you, at least maintained yourself; granted at her size Karen controlled everything. It didn\u2019t mean you had to draw pleasure from it\u2026well\u2026emotional pleasure anyway. Your body had betrayed you enough already. Sighing slightly you rubbed yourself again, this time doing it a few times, as well as the gripping and kissing, now with licking as an addition. In all honesty, you felt sick at yourself. Here you were, at your own Mother\u2019s nipple. In essence having sex with it\u2026talk about weak. Not even Rouge did this to you\u2026she might\u2019ve used you for sex, but never had you do it yourself\u2026this was new\u2026and as much as you hated to admit it\u2026you were enjoying it. Another thrust\u2026another lick\u2026more pleasure\u2026Karen was already long past losing herself\u2026she was moaning like you were IN her! You\u2026you moaned\u2026but you didn\u2019t like it\u2026least not emotionally. How could something so wrong feel so good? It wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you repeated your worship technique, but a feeling in your groin proved ominous. A\u2026flood was on its way\u2026 and with Karen as she was there was no way to stop\u2026you had to continue. Your worship continued progressing, soon to thrusting until your sides hurt, you hated yourself for it but you were starting to lose yourself in the pleasure too. Keeping yourself in check, and holding back certain\u2026forces was driving you nuts. That pleasure was about the only thing positive in this situation, as messed up as it may have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm? That\u2019s odd\u2026a sort of\u2026squelching sound was coming from behind you. You knew for a fact it was a mistake to look\u2026but anything to look away from Karen\u2019s nipple\u2026it may prove what holds you back. In this case, it did the exact opposite. What you saw\u2026it was hot\u2026there was no question; it got your sexual lust into a frenzy, it was\u2026Karen fingering herself to you on her nipple. It was so\u2026so wrong to be turned on by it\u2026but you couldn\u2019t fight it anymore. You gave one last strong thrust against Karen\u2026and allowed your body to release itself; Karen\u2019s also did at the same time resulting in a simultaneous sexual climax. Both to the idea of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single moment everything changed, with your release you finally calmed down\u2026utterly ashamed of yourself. The white goo before you was proof\u2026you had just had sex with your Mother\u2019s nipple\u2026you had come about as close to incest as possible. And Karen noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy dear\u2026is that what I think it is?\u201d She seemed calmed too\u2026likely from her own release. Sweat was still on her brow though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ashamed\u2026but you fessed up. \u201c\u2026Yeah Mom\u2026it is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t say a word, you waited til Karen spoke. \u201cI had no idea I turned you on like this!\u201d Wait what? \u201cI mean, all these years I\u2019ve had you help me with things\u2026even certain\u2026sexual things like this\u2026but I had no idea you were actually attracted to me! I must seem so cruel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the fuck did your Mom get that idea?! Was she just plain crazy now? \u201cNo no no Mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t hear you past her own voice, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry son! Please! Let me make it up to you! I\u2019ll\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At this point nothing should've surprised you anymore. After all, you just had sex with your Mother's nipple as she fingered herself to you in a simultaneous sexual climax. Nothing could be much more surprising than that. But your Mom found a way with her next sentence, \"To make it up to you I'll keep you in my bra all day!\" Say what? The irrational reasoning your Mother used never ceased to baffle you. You stood atop her slowly softening nipple, gaping at her with a dumbfounded expression. \"No Mom! You got it all wrong! I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had sex with my nipple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou initially bit your tongue, but the response escaped anyway. \"Because you ordered me to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her questionable state Karen was quick to respond, \"I never asked you to do that\u2026!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even you could respond to that. She was absolutely right. You knowingly submitted to her like that\u2026and not only that, you enjoyed it. Even if it was only on a physical level. You wondered though\u2026did you really dislike it? Or were you trying to make yourself believe you dislike it? At this point you weren't even sure anymore. All that was certain was the sweat on you and your Mother and the fluids on her. You stared at your seeds with disdain. Karen took your silence as a guilty confirmation, \"I'm sorry baby\u2026all these years\u2026I just\u2026How could I not expect it would have this effect? I mean\u2026it's all my fault\u2026\" All the stuff she did over the years made you develop a fetish? Actually a pretty logical thing to come from Mom. It would fit\u2026only thing is you kept telling yourself you hated it. Did you really though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I said I'll take responsibility.\" Karen affirmed. \"I made you feel this way, it's only fair to stop teasing you and let you have some fun. She loomed her eye over her nipple. \"Hide in one of the smaller ridges so you don't fall when I move around.\" The last thing you wanted was to get closer and deeper into her pink mountain, but you had no choice. After finding a sizable wrinkle in your Mother's nipple, you hopped in and grabbed a hold of the squishy flesh, ready for when she would move and the mountains would inevitably rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a soft moan at your touch and couldn't help but lay a hand on her breast for a moment. But Karen managed to stay calm enough to reach around for her underwear. All the while you hung for dear life as her breasts dangled with gravity. It wasn't but a minute until Mom found a bra though; thankfully, you couldn't hold on much longer. She held it before her breasts, not quite ready to put them on. \"I still have a life to live dear, so I will have to be moving around. I won't have much of a chance to talk either, so I'll just make this clear for you. It's my fault you have this thing for me, so the least I can do for all these years of teasing you is to let you have your wish\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom\u2026?\" You slowly mumbled, hoping she wouldn't say what you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do whatever you want to my breasts. No matter what, I won't mind, in fact I encourage it. Hopefully this can get it out of your system; but if not at least you can have a good time. Am I right?\" All you could do was weakly nod. \"Good\u2026\" She began to close the gap between boob and bra. The shadows began to form over you when she paused; a sliver of her eye was visible between her bra and breast. It looked at you softly before winking, \"Please be gentle\u2026\" She didn't want to get aroused by you as you were there. That much was obvious\u2026but dammit if she couldn't have picked a worse way to phrase it. The words alone were enough to mess with your head. With that Karen said goodbye and placed her bra on, the click behind her back told you it was now set in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now here you were; in the dark, senses heightened, against a mountainous breast and a less mountainous nipple, naked and held tightly against them. You just had your release but the blood was already flowing again, you bit your lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Damn it Mom\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Karen did considerably better. Out of sight out of mind after all. Without you to look at she focused on getting her outfit back on. Finding it and putting it on was no problem at all, she just felt a bit\u2026sleazy and low-class for what just happened, and even worse for her \"realization.\" Regarding her son. It made so much sense though\u2026her face was beet red as she eyed herself in the mirror to make sure she looked okay. Hair a bit off but otherwise fine. <i>Now\u2026what can I do about him\u2026Should I do anything? I do have some plans for today\u2026</i><br>\r\nKaren planned on a night day with a couple of family friends, specifically, her friends Clover and Erika. Friends of the family for nearly 20 years now\u2026They were even trustworthy enough that Karen let them babysit her micro-sized son. Funny enough though, he always didn't like when they watched him\u2026She never knew why. Karen shrugged, that was her initial plan anyway. She could easily do something else for her son, or maybe even do something then go to her friends. The day was still young.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nHmm\u2026.</i><br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple act of your Mother getting dressed was enough to overcomplicate this already insane situation. With each step she took, her breasts bounced about two to three times, sizable enough to you to count as like a nice brief rollercoaster. The bad part, as it bounced up you flew up against her bra, as it fell down\u2026you fell down\u2026and to simplify it, your body rubbed against hers. By the time Karen was dressed and looking in the mirror, you were fighting off a whole new wave of sexual lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on man! It's your damn Mom! Control yourself! </i>The pulsations of your nether region essentially told you the answer your body had. You cursed both aloud and mentally at yourself and the situation. Not to mention knowing your Mom\u2026she was probably debating doing something to make it \"better.\" God knows if she did you'd have the biggest internal struggle of your life\u2026On the other hand\u2026your will was already weak from minutes ago, and the alluring tit of your Mother seemed more attractive and beautiful with each passing second. Another few seconds and you were liable to crack too\u2026Damned if you do, damned if you don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one question rang out in your head.<i> Is Mom gonna try to do something?</i></span></div></div>",

See my sister in action.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister adjusted her glasses; they weren\u2019t there for visual aid. She used them like lawyers on TV did, for dramatic action. On her person they also added the allure of an intelligent beauty, that was an oxymoron if ever there was one. Besides, most people would\u2019ve focused more on the more than inappropriate amount of cleavage she was sporting. That was probably why she made such a good lawyer; no one could focus with such a well endowed chest shoved in their faces. At times you\u2019ve even caught yourself looking at it with lustful eyes. Like the current moment for instance, it took a couple extra seconds before you caught December\u2019s words. \u201cSorry bro, but no excitement today, just paper work and case files. But I think I know how to make it exciting.\u201d Before you could query December brought her fingernail above her cleavage and dropped you into its endless expanse. \u201cClimb from between my boobs; I always love feeling you climb me.\u201d And that was true; it was December\u2019s favorite pass-time with you growing up. It remained as such even today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d long since adjusted to the idea of climbing your sister, but whenever it was between her breasts you were always thrown for a loop. Both of the ungodly mammeries seemed sizable to a continent or even small planet, adorned with an infinite number of thin pores and wrinkles of the skin. There were plenty of places to grab and use as footholds, but the very idea of it was enough to arouse you. Even Rachael\u2019s beautiful pair paled in comparison to December\u2019s, and that was with the knowledge she was your sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time you were asked to do the task though so you skipped the embarrassment phase and went straight to climbing. Thank God December\u2019s breasts were so squished together in her tight outfit; otherwise you would\u2019ve fallen straight to your death. But you were fine, and your climb began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea of climbing a breast was enough to turn on any man, with every grip you\u2019re literally getting a handful of boob and pulling yourself up. There was nothing special to the climbing method, and the feeling hadn\u2019t changed over the last several years. You start out embarrassed, then slowly as you work your way up you get over it. In a way climbing December\u2019s boobs built character, you get some exercise and learn some nice self control with temptation. But there are always moments of weakness, like one you had about halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing; you just climbed like you had for the last hour. December had long since continued her work and possibly forgot you were even there. You were halfway up December\u2019s right breast, your starting point miles below you in a chasm of darkness. You reached up for another handhold, you got it. But when you pulled up\u2026your grip slipped for a brief moment. You stumbled a bit and quickly reached up with your other hand for support; but your head leaned forward the slightest amount and before you knew it, was deep within the never-ending flesh of your sister\u2019s breast. The soft feel of her skin against your face was enough to arouse any man, including you. Before you even knew it you were looking at December\u2019s breast in the faint light transfixed, a tinge of red crossing your cheek. You could feel your heart beat, it couldn\u2019t hurt. You leaned in and gave one, subtle, kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe submission to your sister\u2019s beauty was amazingly satisfying, but your body craved more; and in your moment of weakness, you caved. You gave another kiss, then a lick, a nuzzle against her boob. Five minutes later you were pretty much humping her breast like you were in love. The temptation caused you to be horny, and the horniness caused you to lose all reason. It didn\u2019t even matter December was your sister now, she was smoking hot and you wanted her in your messed up moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the giantess didn\u2019t even notice, she was too focused into her work. But she could feel her nipples growing hard and goosebumps breaking out along her skin, her body knew what was up, but she didn\u2019t. You were in heaven, somehow having lost all reason. Your hand reached for your pants, in a bid to remove them. A moment later, a microscopic pair of jeans were fluttering down the dark chasm of her cleavage, you were almost naked against the massive mammery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment you realized, you were about to submit sexually to your sister\u2019s breast. It seemed so\u2026<i>so wrong</i>. But your aroused self wanted it so. Could you really live with yourself for doing it? Would you really go that far for sexual pleasure?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Rouge sat in the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my little micro toy.\"She grinned maliciously.\"Oh, and you too, December.\"She acknowledged your sister with a casual wave. December got in the car, and the three of you were off. Confusion filled your little mind. Why would Rouge help with this? She loved you being microscopic! If you were normal sized, you would refuse to be her slave anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey December...\"Rouge said after driving for awhile.\"Since this is going to be your brother's last time being 1/100th of an inch tall...\"You knew where she was going with this.\"Could you place him down by my feet? For old times sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since it was like old times, December agreed full-heartedly.\"Sure!\"She quipped, bending over and dropping you into Rouge's awaiting boot. You fell through darkness for what seemed like an eternity before landing on a surface that you had come well known to. One of Rouge's toes. She wriggled her mountains with glee.\"Ge to it, my little speck! I know you'll enjoy this one last time...\"</span></div></div>",

This, of course, was intentional, Rouge was an outstanding driver; she was simply relishing having you under foot again, it had been a little bit over a year or so. December, in perfect blonde format, didn't realize this and only pushed Rouge to hurry up, which did little more than give Rouge a reason to vent the mild annoyance of being bossed around on you, in the form of added pressure with her toe. Those 40-minutes were the worst of your life\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight of the bat Rouge let out a laugh and wiggled her toes, \u201cFor old times sake my slave, why don\u2019t you give my toes a few good licks?\u201d From the same heavens Rouge\u2019s voice came from you could hear December\u2019s protests, protests Rouge quickly shut down with clever wordplay\u2026hell she should\u2019ve been the lawyer. But without December\u2019s aid, as well as past experience, you knew better than to cross the giantess and fell to your knees in licking. From the taste alone you could tell Rouge had prepared for this <i>Finale</i> of sorts; her foot tasted worse than normal, and extra body-heat said she was literally warming up for you.  Alone this would\u2019ve just been annoying, you stopped getting embarrassed by this stuff ages ago, at least from Rouge anyway; but of course, Rouge had more in store for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a speedy stomp of her boot the woman revved the vehicle and began his long drive, tapping her boot knowing full well it slammed you around like a toy. But it wasn\u2019t just that! Eventually December grew impatient and started throwing out things like \u201cHurry up!\u201d in a way that, as the boss, she ordered Rouge, and if there was one thing you knew about the demoness\u2026it was that she preferred being the one in charge. A mild frustration formed quickly, and she found a way to cope by rubbing you into her boot\u2019s insole. Long story short, it was hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t\u2026<i>that</i> long before she finally arrived at the lab. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Her lips curled into a smile as her pale foot exited her footwear. A desperate wheeze of fresh air escaped you as her purple painted toes finally left you with space to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh,</i> You sat upright, feeling your bones creak in places. \u201cWhen I turn big you are so gonna get it girl.\u201d Normally Rouge wouldn\u2019t hear you, but as you spoke her lips formed into a rather demented smile, a smile that said she was up to something\u2026but what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m being paranoid\u2026there\u2019s no way this woman will end up ruining this day for me. I\u2019m gonna be big!</i><br>\r\nOut of nowhere December\u2019s hand slid into the boot, blocking out Rouge as her tan skin flung in searching for you. Upon finding you the giantess plucked you out with her nails, \u201cEnough of your weird obsession with Rouge\u2019s feet bro, there\u2019s no time. You can have your fun later.\u201d She took off out of the car, running in her heels as Rouge calmly strolled behind. You made a note of Rouge\u2019s version of her torment of you, you\u2019ll make her pay for that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the lab it was like a movie, blinking computers, men in lab coats, the smell of medicine despite it being a technology lab, but it only felt like one thing to you, the feeling of being big. You grinned just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bearded man, the main scientist, walked up with a smile towards you in December\u2019s palm. \u201cHello there, are you ready for the experiment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a big thumbs up and screamed, \u201cHell yeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquipped with a special device to hear you, the scientist chuckled. \u201cGood, but first I need to cover the safety protocols\u2026\u201d You tuned out a bit there, listening mildly; but your main focus was on the machine in the center of a test chamber, a room you saw through an observational window. Honestly it looked like the stereotypical device used to alter size in movies, and it never looked more divine than in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all\u2026any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d To your surprise the scientist gestured to Rouge as well, \u201cAnd you are ready too Miss?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \u201cOf course1 Anything to help my little buddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused for a moment, until you recalled the scientist\u2019s explanation. Someone would have to hold you in order to operate the device. Non organic substances could hinder the growth process, but ironically, human tissue didn\u2019t affect it at all. So basically, a person would be needed to hold you while you got hit with the Growth Ray, and Rouge volunteered for the job, other scientists being too scared to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt uneasy about Rouge, but you didn\u2019t fight it as you and her were brought before the machine. To avoid contamination it was only you and her, so she pushed some buttons during the setup process, as asked by the scientists. But you noticed she pushed a few extra buttons and whispered some things to you. \u201cThis\u2019ll make the target indestructible so nothing could kill it and this\u2026.\u201d She noticed you listening and winked, you instantly flipped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop her! She\u2019s trying something!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge pushed the button starting the ray and walked before it, \u201cNo use my pet, their little listening devices don\u2019t work for you in here.\u201d She whispered since they could still hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green energy of the ray pulsated, starting to emit. You stretched your hand out, <b>\u201cNOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d</b>A blinding green light blinded everyone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments later when the light died down you lowered your arms, <i>What happened? Rouge pushed some buttons\u2026.\u201dThe target is indestructible...?\u201d The hell does that even mean?! I can\u2019t die? And that other button\u2026</i><br>\r\nYou looked around and quickly realized what happened, and you never felt more afraid\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a second, just a second, you felt amazing. The testing room was no longer an infinite plain, the growth ray, not its own planet. Through the testing window you saw December, no longer a goddess in size, power, and ability, but just your sister. You were normal-sized, and for those few blissful moments, you felt happier than you ever were. That is, until a mild, if not familiar, tremor behind you made you turn around. <i>That</i> sight made you want to die a little inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt a result of her manipulation of the buttons; Rouge was now a towering giantess, appearing no different to you than ever before\u2026scratch that, she seemed <i>bigger</i>. The only reason the entire building wasn\u2019t destroyed with everyone inside of it was but a stroke of luck. Rouge grew so big that her feet were on either side of the building, too far apart to do any damage without her desiring it. Everything else was destroyed in a forty-mile radius, but somehow the building you and everyone was in remained; you faintly recalled Rouge moving in the blinding light of the growth ray\u2026Did she plan for this? You, used to seeing people that large, managed to turn yourself away to look at the others; shock was the mildest way of describing their faces. December couldn\u2019t seem to comprehend what just happened, and the scientists unable to calculate where their calculations were wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the glistening sunlight the giantess let out a content sigh, \u201cWell what do you know? I guess I grew. Aren\u2019t I the lucky girl?\u201d Rouge\u2019s purple-lipstick covered lips smiled down at you, specifically the building you were in, but still\u2026you. It was nauseating that she\u2026she looked so <i>beautiful</i> up there with the clouds, a goddess in appearance, although certainly not soul. Her eyes grew lustful, and as if to prove a point, she spat in a random direction, you could hear buildings collapsing. \u201cI guess we both got what we wanted, eh Boot-Slave? You wanted to be big, and so did I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimaced at your old nickname, \u201cWhat did you do Rouge?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard you the same way she did when you were only tiny, her insane senses. To answer your question though, Rouge simply shrugged, \u201cI visited here a lot for December. You\u2019d be surprised what you pick up on. All I did was apply what I knew.\u201d She paused to look around, \u201cAnd it seems to have worked, this high up I shouldn\u2019t have enough air to breathe. I guess that\u2019s a check for invincibility, so I can\u2019t die\u2026and I seem the right height. I did say 500 miles\u2026\u201d Her eyes lit up in your direction. \u201c<i>To start</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were\u2026<i>mortified</i>. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.horrible. You can\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge found your plight amusing, \u201cA Goddess can do whatever she wants little insect. I\u2019m invincible, and bigger than anything else in existence. I do believe I qualify as a Goddess.\u201d Her white boot hovered into view, holding itself above you, December, and everyone else. \u201cI spent a lot of time deciding my size you know. I can go to maybe\u2026600 miles high before I get too big for the planet itself. I wanted to have some fun with my playthings before we got to that point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you were honestly beginning to feel like you were a hero in some movie, \u201cYou\u2019ll never get away with that! I won\u2019t let you!\u201d Obviously it was all talk, but you had to say <i>something.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge\u2019s hovered boot held itself; you couldn\u2019t help but notice the specks of dirt that grew along with her, not mountains big enough to destroy building. The giantess tilted her head back and laughed at your words. \u201cBold words slave. Perhaps I need to help you understand the situation. Every single person is so small to me I can fit them into a wrinkle, of a wrinkle on my foot! Possibly even a pore! Your armies and weapons are pebbles and gnats to me; in fact, not even that! Not to mention I\u2019m invincible! I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t like the idea little one, but I <i>am</i> God now. Get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hardly the time for such a thing, but your mouth was already asking. \u201cHow did you manage to pull off invincibility anyway?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge\u2019s enormous finger pointed to the scientists behind you, \u201cIt was their backup plan. Basically if you were still small or smaller, you\u2019d get a consolation prize. I used that for <i>this</i>.\u201d She gestured to her figure with a faint hint of self-admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally sank in too, how screwed you, the entire world was. No doubt everyone in the country\u2026hell probably most countries, could see and hear Rouge. See and hear a gigantic, beautiful, voluptuous woman dressed in a white-skirt, thigh-high white boots, with a black T-shirt exposing enormous cleavage. In appearance alone, most men probably already began worshipping, that was how beautiful she was. This Demoness ruled the world, and there wasn\u2019t a thing anyone could do about it. No weapons would hurt her. There was a chance she\u2019d never age. She desired the full obedience and worship of all. Rouge had already won before it even began. You fell to your knees in that realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid! You just had to get bigger! Now you\u2019ve gone and doomed the entire world! </i>You were on the verge of hurting yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gave another Earth-shattering laugh, \u201cYou all hear that right my bugs? I\u2019m not going anywhere! So I\u2019d advise making your Goddess happy.\u201d Her fingers pointed to the debris that were cities at her feet, \u201cI know there are people near my feet, you can pledge your allegiance by cleaning my boots. You\u2019re filthy buildings got dirt on them.\u201d She paused for a moment, before smiling evilly. \u201cAnd I want them cleaned\u2026with your <i>tongues</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sounds from the locations obviously didn\u2019t reach your ears, but you knew; you knew they were submitting without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge\u2019s eyebrows raised in joy, confirming it. Fingers at her waists, she turned her attention back to you and your, still awe-struck and petrified, companions. \u201cNow what to do with you all\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A hand descended from heaven, casting a shadow over many, many miles of the land. You have no idea how she did it, but Rouge, using just one finger, pryed the roof off the building you all were in with her nail, and scooped up the growth ray, raising it up to her face. She must have senses...far beyond any normal humans. That must've been how she found you and tortured you for all of these years. It must've taken superhuman perception to find someone as small as you so easily. She stood back up, eying her prize resting on the tip of her purple-painted nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that I have this....I suppose everything around it is useless to me now.\"She raised her right boot, bringing it over countless miles until it hovered over the entire city in which you resided.\"It's been fun, my special little slave...\"She was speaking to you now.\"But...a girl's gotta move on. A Goddess has other needs to be attended to...like ruling a whole world of microbes? Or possibly....an entire universe.\"Rouge cackled,slowly lowering her stark white boot, relishing the fear and screams of all of the people below, feeling the power of controlling the lives of millions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shadow came closer and closer, you had only on thought. You rushed out of the testing room, and hugged December. She was the only family nearby. She squeezed back, tears streaming down her face.\"Why didn't you ever tell me Rouge was like this?! She...she's a...a....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A devil?\"You finished. Despite the circumstances of death, you couldn't help but notice, at regular height, you stood over December for a good 3 or 4 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, and returned to the dire situation at hand. You couldn't do anything about it. You were useless, just like you've always been. You only wished Rachael was here, your kids, your mother, Melly......hell, even Andrew, your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the boot came down, crushing everything beneath it, mountains valleys, plains, cities, all were subjected beneath Rouge's heel. She bursted out into a fit of maniacal laughter, booming thunder all around. Ater she was satisfied, she raised her boot and placed it back in it's original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alive. Caked in debris and surrounded by devastation, but you were alive. You released December, gazing all around. You guessed you and she had ended up beneath a safer tread of her sole. But as you looked about, you had estimated that everything within a hundred mile radius was in the shape of Rouge's bootpint. A grunt rom high above caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit.....you're still alive.\"Rouge muttered, her plan not going accordingly at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew you were still alive?! You guessed super senses again. Or, possibly, Rouge really was a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it appears you and that idiot are still alive, slave.\"She immedietly shifted her tone of voice from annoyed back to sultry and deep.\"I suppose for my next move as Goddess, I cold....\"</span></div></div>",

You never saw something like that before, in a way it sort of fascinated you. The way they moved along with the smoke, all bundled together\u2026something about that seemed familiar but you couldn\u2019t put your finger on it. The whole deal with Rouge was much more of a focus than anything some grainy-looking smoke. She did something at the last second, but what? With each second more smoke cleared and you were growing increasingly nervous. The whole room seemed different, it looked the same but\u2026the perspectives felt off. Maybe Rouge actually made you big, actually did something nice? It sounded impossible but\u2026it would explain things. A bit of happiness started forming inside, a happiness Rouge crushed in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, it looks like something went wrong. \u201c Her voice was loud, far louder than it had ever been before, even when she screamed. Before it seemed like regular voices were as loud and thunderous as the voice of a God, but this completely redefined that. Just one syllable out of the woman\u2019s mouth was enough to nearly burst an eardrum, hear breaths nearly as loud as her voice used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, you started to notice things. First off, you were still on Rouge\u2019s hand, but massive ridges seemed to leave you trapped in a deep canyon within her palm, the wrinkles on her hand? They looked grainy like the smoke did. You couldn\u2019t even see the giantess past the walls of flesh, yet you could hear and feel her entire body at work. The blood running, the sounds of each organ doing their jobs, it was\u2026medically fascinating as weird as that sounded. But the most significant thing you noticed was above, literally, the ceiling. You were right in thinking your perspective had changed, but it wasn\u2019t closer, it was <i>farther</i>. All these things led to one, terrifying conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Growth Ray failed, you had instead shrunken even further. Small enough to the point you were actually able to visibly see atoms! That was what the grainy-looking things were, atoms at work. You were\u2026<i>microscopic</i>. The experiment failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No\u2026</i>Rouge did this, the experiment didn\u2019t fail, she made it. You looked up angrily at her looming face, at a mocking smile displaying her dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you bitch! Why would you do this to me?! Why do you torture me like this!?\u201d You screamed to the point your lungs hurt; the dream you so often craved came so close\u2026but Rouge just saw fit to take that pleasure away from you and turn it into another sick game. At least you so small it was a guarantee she couldn\u2019t see or hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t talk like that if I were you tiny, you don\u2019t even qualify as a slave anymore, that\u2019s above you. You\u2019re just entertainment now, and the moment that ends, I end you.\u201d Her smile seemed all the more ominous with each word, and you grew all the more baffled. How could she see, let alone hear you?! It just seemed impossible, this had to be a nightmare, it just had to be. All that could escape your puny mouth was one word, \u201c\u2026How\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge continued to smile, \u201cBecause I <i>am</i> a Goddess of course.\u201d With that statement a wave of darkness blotted out everything, judging from the faint rustles of movement you heard it seemed she closed her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud clicks that were footsteps came too; Rouge was probably leaving the experimental area. The noise of a door confirmed it, right away people stepped forward to ask Rouge what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farce Rouge claimed as an explanation just sickened you, literally, her voice was so loud is was making you nauseas, as well as the idea itself. Apparently the Growth Ray made a lot more smoke then expected, so they couldn\u2019t see anything; and everyone was too nervous to consider trying to listen or speak to the two inside. That gave the demoness the ideal situation. She described how the ray blinded her, how she tried her best to remain calm but accidentally dropped you from shock. And from there, witnessed how you went from small, to microscopic. She tried to search for you amidst the smoke, but it proved difficult. All of it was false of course; Rouge was a master at lying. In fact, she conveniently left out whether she found you or not in her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappointed groans of the various scientists (as well as family) depressed you. \u201cDon\u2019t give up! It works; just make sure this bitch does- \u201cThe Goddess clenched her fist to silence you. The canyons of her palm seemed to squeeze together in an attempt to crush you between their walls. No struggles did anything, just made the time seem to go by slower. Eventually the canyon became a narrow passage, and eventually that became nothing at all; you were squished in a canyon of skin in Rouge\u2019s palm. For a brief instant you welcomed death at that moment, an awakening to the nightmare called life; but all that awaited you was excruciating pain. Bones were breaking, organs rupturing; you were literally as flat as paper, but still one-hundred percent alive. All that you experienced was the pain death would\u2019ve saved you from, pain too great for words. It was true, Rouge also made you invincible as well as microscopic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst your screams and suffering December\u2019s voice echoed sadly into your ears, \u201cWhat about my brother\u2026Is he\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God! December noticed something was missing in Rouge\u2019s story! You\u2019d never call her a blonde again after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rouge already had a rehearsed response reply ready...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a move that surprised even you at this point, Rouge brought you up before your titaness of a sister, hands open. Your body reformed instantly, just fast enough for you to catch Rouge\u2019s words clearly. \u201cThankfully, but he\u2019s so\u2026you have to see in order to understand.\u201d Giving a nod December pulled out a magnifying glass (always carried for your sake) and began to examine the eternal plain that was Rouge\u2019s palm. Seeing her eye loom into the heavens startled you, simply because it only further served to note how small you were. You could see atoms, that much was already apparent, but\u2026it was just the way the situation was. December\u2019s eye seemed to massive, perhaps the biggest single structure you had ever seen, not counting things like an entire body of course. Even entire hands didn\u2019t seem as big prior to this, and yet an eye alone dwarfed it? You\u2019d hate to see something like Rouge\u2019s feet or, hell, even just her hand; her palm was plenty big enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, December\u2019s words worsened the feeling, \u201cSorry Rouge, but I don\u2019t see him.\u201d You were too small for her to see you with a magnifying glass!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gave a brief chuckle, \u201cOh it\u2019s okay, he\u2019s right here.\u201d She used a finger to pinpoint your location, \u201cSafe and sound in a wrinkle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her guidance December found you, \u201cWow, you\u2019re right he is small! But how did you know\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gothy girl gave a shrug, \u201cInstinct. Maybe me and the little guy have a connection or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneered, <i>Yeah, the relationship between a lion and a mouse.</i><br>\r\nAnd yet Rouge heard you, \u201cHmm? Got something to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecember interrupted, and likely saved, you, \u201cHuh? You can hear him Rouge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, \u201cYeah, maybe that ray made it so I can hear him\u2026?\u201d It was obviously what she had done, but you had to admit, she sounded pretty convincing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecember turned to a flustered scientist, \u201cW-Well\u2026it\u2019s not <i>im</i>possible\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget that,\u201d Rouge intervened, \u201cCan it be reversed? This size thing?\u201d Just like her, help her seem innocent in everything by acting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt <i>should</i> be, but the thing is\u2026We don\u2019t know what went wrong. It could take months, maybe years before we figure out what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen get started.\u201d December stated in her authoritative lawyer voice; she gestured to Rouge and you. \u201cCome on; let\u2019s get out of her before something else goes wrong.\u201d The clicking of heels and the whirr of the passing ceiling told you Rouge was doing just that. She and December didn\u2019t say anything, which worried you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment everyone was out in fresh air the silence broke, December sounded tense. \u201cRouge\u2026since you can hear and see my brother; I think you should be the one to keep an eye on him for the time being. No one else really can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?! </i>Your sister was entrusting you to the demon that caused this?! Like hell! You screamed loud curses in protest; the sound waves probably didn\u2019t even leave Rouge\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand the beauty feigned surprise excellently, \u201cReally? Why not you, your Mother or Sister? Or even his Wife?\u201d If there was even a microbe of a chance you would\u2019ve been heard, the engulfing voice blocked it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecember still sounded as tense as can be,\u201d I\u2019m too busy, maybe every once in a while\u2026but you\u2019d be better. As for Mom...well truth is, she\u2019s already questionable around him. This might be too much. I have to think about his safety,\u201d She paused just in time for you to let out a demented laugh at the irony, and judging from Rouge\u2019s body, she was happy to hear it too. \u201cAs for Rachael\u2026she\u2019d be good, but he has kids. They\u2019re just too young for this, same with Melly. In all honesty, you are the best candidate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was silent, silent with what you knew to be excitement. But she cleverly hid it, instead seeming hesitantly optimistic, \u201cHear that little guy? I guess we\u2019re going to be together a lot more often now.\u201d You nearly cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t even close to over, Rouge already figured out a way to celebrate. \u201cHey December, he still seems pretty down. I think I know what can cheer him up, and celebrate my new roomy.\u201d The blonde tilted her head, \u201cHmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s have him enjoy four of the biggest boobs of his life. Like what we used to do.\u201d She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea surprised everyone, especially December. \u201cReally? No offense Rouge, but I doubt my breasts are what he wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was answered with a shrug, \u201cBoobs are boobs. If he doesn\u2019t like yours he\u2019s got mine. Regardless, he\u2019s a guy, he\u2019ll like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, it's a little odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecember blushed, \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d With some unbuttoning the blonde giantess undid her blouse just enough to reveal some extensive cleavage; Rouge didn\u2019t need to do any such thing due to already being revealing. All the pale giantess had to do was place you gently at the tip of her shirt, a spot that was easily big enough to run a mile on. Behind you were two pale mammeries known as Rouge\u2019s breasts, just two planets of temptation awaiting you to fall into their depths. Likewise, before you were December\u2019s breasts, coming in fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAM!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a heartbeat boob met boob and you were trapped in a four-way sandwich of breasts. The clothing did little to disguise the bare skin to you, especially since you were so small. It might as well have been four bare boobs against you. Pleasure and pain fought each other as you sat amidst the planets. On one hand, they were breasts, and like it or not sexual pleasure was arousing you, enough to make you grope some of the breast around you. You hated yourself once it was apparent it was Rouge\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand the pressure from both girl\u2019s ungodly chests was enough to flatten you again, that pain amidst the pleasure confused your body enough to frustrate you. Be upset over the pain and situation? Or happy that you could be considered the luckiest guy alive? It didn\u2019t even make sense to you anymore. In truth nothing could describe the feeling of being wedged between four breasts and microscopic size, the endless flesh, the four nipples that taunted you with their size in the distance, your body in a frenzy to act, it was simply too much to describe. And to make it worse the duo did this for ten whole minutes, to people outside it just appeared to be two girls hugging. They had no idea of your situation and problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually things did find a way to get a bit worse of course; Rouge leaned forward, adding pressure to your frame. There was nothing special about it, but when she pulled away\u2026you ended up lodged into the fabric of her purple top, or maybe it was her bra? It didn\u2019t matter; point is you were stuck in clothing as she and December released one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you talked me into that.\u201d The blonde laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stuck out her tongue, \u201cDon\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t like it! ...But thanks for doing it. The little guy is happy.\u201d <i>Like hell</i>, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026Wait, where is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gestured to her top, \u201cSo small he slid right into the fabric, pretty convenient actually. I might just let him stay there until I get home. Let him enjoy my twins for a little bit longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure he doesn\u2019t do anything pervy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecember began to walk away, her car being there beforehand. She stopped halfway there, \u201cHey Rouge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for doing this; really\u2026it means a lot. In fact, take the week off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge grinned, \u201cThanks December!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the word you meant was Boss.\u201d She laughed as she entered her car. Moments later she drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Mini-Cooper left the parking lot Rouge\u2019s personality changed, back to her devil self. She cupped her breasts and in turn, you. \u201cGood to be alone eh? Now, start worshipping me. I wanna feel good on the way. But no touching my skin, let\u2019s save that\u2026just worship the clothes I\u2019m wearing instead, like a good slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think I\u2019m going to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr if you want, I let you fall through my shirt and let you see what it\u2019s like hitting the pavement from here. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already on your knees bowing and kissing the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge let out an evil chuckle, \u201cVery good slave\u2026\u201d She took two steps before stopping. \u201cOh, and <i>never</i> speak to me again. Speaking is a privilege only humans have; you can only talk if I say so. Got it?\u201d Thank God you didn\u2019t make the mistake of vocally confirming that, Rouge took your silence as a form of further submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that out of the way, the goddess approached her car and sat behind the wheel. With the rev of her engines Rouge was off to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no doubt in your head about where Rouge was going; home, so she can feel free to be as evil as she could ever want. Her enthusiastic hums and impatient foot taps were all the evidence needed to support the idea. And in the fibers of her top was you, feebly lapping away at the fabric so you can appease your new Goddess. It was either that or getting tortured, and if Rouge was right about you being unable to die\u2026you didn\u2019t want to even <i>think</i> about what kind of torturing she could do. In all the years she\u2019d screwed with you, she always held back for your life; now that safety limit was off, and you were free game. Plus, she owned you for now (And probably forever) so there were no witnesses to make her ease up on you. For all intents and purposes, you truly were a slave to a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized all of this, even how your supposed immortality could be turned to your advantage. But the sheer fear of Rouge going all out on you was enough to turn you into the sniveling, cloth-worshipping bug you were at the moment. All sorts of small cloth particles clung to your tongue and made it feel like fur, but you didn\u2019t dare do anything about it. Rouge was watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess sighed a little bit in relief, \u201cThat went better then I had hoped. I bet you think so too little slave. Now you\u2019re mine forever. How about we celebrate?\u201d The seductive voice giggled as a hand gave a quick bounce to her breasts. All you could make out of it was that you were flying insanely fast towards Rouge\u2019s breasts, making direct contact with one of the mountains in a collision. The next moment, the Goddess threw out one of her favorite commands, \u201cNow worship my nipple.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways worshipping body parts with this girl\u2026It was nothing new. Sliding down her planetary breast without a safety net, that was new. Gravity took its course and started sliding you down the perfect mound of flesh towards the place you wanted to; looming ahead was the large skyscraper of Rouge\u2019s nipple, cloaked in the shadow of her clothing. It wasn\u2019t really a describable thing; all you could register was the sheer awe at the size of her nipple. A structure large enough for a couple hundred people to live on\u2026and it wasn\u2019t even erect! In a way that was fortunate though, it was big enough to get in your path and stop you from sliding too far. Slightly hesitant, you walked along the wrinkled, pink surface. Canyons of wrinkles were abundant in all directions, large enough for several smaller buildings even. You would\u2019ve spent a few more minutes in awe, but you could hear Rouge\u2019s body showing signs of impatience so you jumped right into it. On all fours, you began massaging and licking the surface of her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge let out a soft moan as she felt your worship, \u201cVery good slave! You\u2019re learning quickly!\u201d Her voice\u2019s shrill sound waves nearly burst your ears. You still had yet to learn of the exact extents for what Rouge had done to you; of course you\u2019d obey her for now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re curious what I did huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wisely silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThought so, well let me explain\u2026\u201d Thank God Rouge was a bragger; right then and there she started explaining everything. How, thanks to a lot of studying on her part, and paying attention to the scientists, she learned how to rework the growth ray into a shrinking one. And from there she learned off all sorts of other theoretical possibilities. In the few seconds Rouge pushed a few buttons before blasting you, she had changed it so that you had shrunken further and became invincible\u2026but that was not all. Now, since she was also blasted, she could hear and know where you were at all times. And on top of it, she even gained almost like a sense regarding your feelings. In other words, she could feel your misery and let it turn her on. It all too sci-fi for your tastes; but it involved you, and that was not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished her little story Rouge quickly went back to commanding you \u201cGo deeper into my nipple. I want to feel you worship it from<i> within </i>it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would\u2019ve rolled your eyes if you weren\u2019t certain Rouge could find out. But you did as asked and went further in to worship\u2026A lot further in\u2026in fact\u2026It seemed like you got lost. By that point you felt a small sense of dread as you kneeled over and continued worshipping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge seemed to sense that and worked things out quickly, \u201cFeeling a little lost there my pet? You\u2019d better figure a way out soon. Because when I get home I\u2019ll want you out of there. And if you can\u2019t get out\u2026well I can just take a shower and let that do the job. But\u2026The water will be so big you might drown\u2026or at least\u2026feel like your drowning. You can\u2019t die\u2026but do you really wanna go through that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer, not-so-subtle, hint quickly got you to act. Running around for the way you came, but Rouge\u2019s evil knew no bounds. \u201cWho said you could stop worshipping?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset and starting to panic, you kneeled over and resumed what you were doing, crawling all the while. You hoped to find the way out soon\u2026or else\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Rouge returned home\u2026had you found your way out?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s only natural given Rouge\u2019s nipple was as big as a mountain. By the time she\u2019d arrived home you were, of course, still lost in the vast canyons within her tit. You wondered if she somehow foresaw this outcome the moment you got lost, you wouldn\u2019t put it past her. Or maybe she just used every opportunity she got to be evil to you. Either way, when the two of you arrived at her home her words were as expected. \u201cI told you what would happen if you failed my pet. I guess it\u2019s time for a shower\u2026\u201d The ground quaked with each movement of the Goddess\u2019 body as she rose from her car and entered her home. Loud clicks and clanks that seemed far too loud to just belong to a door or something rang out along your ears. Inside all that could be heard was the sound of Rouge\u2019s shoes moving along the carpeted floor as she hummed a soft tune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t see anything but you imagined the d\u00e9cor hadn\u2019t changed much since you\u2019d last been at her home a year ago. Rouge\u2019s house had a rather high amount of quality to it. It made her seem far wealthier than what her job would allow. In fact, you\u2019d often wondered how she got it in the first place. Rich family? Side business? Or maybe she was just great with finances. Regardless, Rouge\u2019s home looked like it cost about 20,000 more dollars than she could afford. The house was large and tidy with dark violet furniture and a Queen-sized bed in each bedroom. Odd considering she lived alone, but Rouge still had a tendency of having friends stay over. In fact, on occasion Ingrid stayed the night here. You never approved by Rachael insisted she spend time with her \u201cAunt who loves her so.\u201d You were always paranoid she\u2019d come back like a Rouge Jr. Thankfully that never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CLANK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lock shifted behind you, Rouge shut a door. While you were busy thinking over how her house looked she must\u2019ve finished readying for her showed. Very faintly came the sound of her placing things on the toilet seat, probably her next set of clothes. Then there was the sound of soft rustles down below, along with the sound of something getting kicked aside. You imagined accurately the demoness just removed the lower portion of her outfit, leaving her legs bare. What came next was pretty much what you expected; light filtered in through the tight bra Rouge wore. Not a lot, but enough for someone of your size to notice. Rouge was shirtless, and soon, bra-less. In the mean time, you noted her bathroom had some new things. It was always large, large like\u2026two people could feel cozy in it. And now there were black curtains along the bathtub and some black decorations on the toilet. Nothing important, but it drew your attention long enough for Rouge to slip off her underwear. She was completely bare, and the sudden influx of light was enough to blind you. Her breasts bounced free from their tight confines as Rouge eyeballed herself in the mirror, no doubt turned on by the idea of her own beauty and the fact she had a small slave worshipping her. In all honesty, you were turned on too. That was how beautiful Rouge was. From the thin view past her nipple you stared into the mirror yourself, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rare moment to see Rouge completely naked, so you were thrown completely off. But she was even more stunning than ever: her breasts and butt large, her feet perfectly taken care of, her face flawless. In the full-body mirror she looked about as perfect as a human could get. The sight of her naked, Goddess-form, was enough to make even you, for a moment, feel joy to be around her. It wasn\u2019t a feeling you particularly liked given past experience, but you couldn\u2019t help it. Physical emotion dominated everything right now, and right now your body was telling you to serve Rouge with the utmost joy. You hated being a guy right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge giggled, probably having noticed your reaction. \u201cJust think bug, this is what you\u2019ll be serving from now on! But before that\u2026\u201d Her face shifted to a bit of a darker mischievous expression, \u201c\u2026I do believe I need a shower\u2026\u201d You turned ghostly white as Rouge approached her bathtub and turned on the water. She seemed to have moved her breasts with her hand to aim properly, the first spout of water hit her nipple directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your perspective, it was a typhoon of the highest caliber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water instantaneously equaled the amount on all of Earth to you, and double that came a second later. All that water rained down upon Rouge\u2019s breasts, and her nipples were quickly flooded with the liquid. You were at least half a mile underwater when the water simply dripped off of the Goddess. The pain of being unable to breathe quickly started to take affect; but being unable to die\u2026you couldn\u2019t do much else but experience the pain. Stuck in a huge pool of falling water, your eyes stung as you looked at Rouge\u2019s body as you fell down. She was smirking directly at you all the way until you made contact with the hard floor of her bathtub. The water began heading towards the drain, and the last thing you would see of Rouge would be her flawless body, dripping wet and hotter than ever\u2026Dammit, why\u2019d she have to be evil? Soon the gigantic hole of the drain surrounded you, and Rouge flew further from view. You coughed in sharp pain as the lack of air really started to take effect. Consciousness began to fade away, and Rouge was soon completely and utterly out of sight past the drain. Faintly you could see the ceiling in the distance. Before you fell unconscious you had one last thought, what would become of you? Rouge wouldn\u2019t simply have you washed away on Day One would she? You fell unconscious with that lingering mystery in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nIf dreams were meant to help you rest, this wasn\u2019t one you wanted to rest in. The world seemed fuzzy, unfocused, you were aware it was a dream. That just made it feel worse when you saw Rouge in the bathtub, taking a bath this time instead of a shower. You were there too, floating in the water before her two planetary boobs. Well, to be more accurate, her cleavage was holding a small pool of water, that\u2019s where you were. Rouge was being the evil Goddess she was and teasing you with her wet body as she cupped her breasts and moved them around. She said some words too, but they weren\u2019t really that audible in dream land. Probably evil taunts or orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream wasn\u2019t actually all that bad oddly enough, being surrounded by Rouge\u2019s beauty was actually\u2026sort of nice. She was more beautiful than any other woman right now, and you were hers. Wait\u2026why was that a good thing\u2026? As you logically tried to think that out, the dream you began to do something you never considered possible. You began to willingly worship Rouge from the pool in her cleavage and were happy to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell\u2026? </i>You wondered, weirded out by the scenario. Dreams were the mind\u2019s way of working something out\u2026what did this mean\u2026? The dream started to get a lot fuzzier as you asked yourself that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nThe first thing you did while wake up was start coughing, a lot. You were wheezing for air, the water was\u2026well it wasn\u2019t gone, there were still huge drops/pools everywhere, but there was more air than water now. Rouge\u2019s must\u2019ve been done with her shower and you\u2026you probably washed up somewhere. Wherever it was, it was dark-colored and kind of tangled. You were inside of something, that\u2019s why it was so dark. You wondered what you washed up in, some seaweed or something? You took a breath and smelled beauty products, this wasn\u2019t any seaweed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came a voice you weren\u2019t expecting, \u201cWhy look at that, there was some hair stuck in the drain. I wonder\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monolithic finger brushed aside some of the darkness, some of the hair, and pulled the clump of it you were in out. You were still in the drain; this hair clump stopped you from getting too far. Looming over you was the nearly-dry, clothed, Rouge, smiling. \u201cWell what do you know? It looks like some old hair got stuck down there and stopped you from getting too far eh tiny? It\u2019s almost like a God or<i> Goddess </i>wanted to make sure you wouldn\u2019t get away.\u201d All you could do was cough out a little bit more water. Of course Rouge played you again\u2026of freaking course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve been properly punished for disobeying me. But I just need one last thing before you\u2019re off the hook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is it now?</i><br>\r\nRouge didn\u2019t waste a second to say it, or to be exact, do it. Her big toe was over you. \u201cI need to crush you so you understand what it means to disobey your owner.\u201d The logic was flimsy at best, but when Rouge\u2019s toe got on top of you the last thing you thought of was logic. Just imagine, a girl the size of a universe, all that weight focused into one toe, and that toe was on top of you. Unable to die, but able to feel pain, that was your situation. The pain was indescribable, literally. No words could approach the dimension of pain you were in. And Rouge was probably getting off on that feeling. It seemed to last an eternity before subsiding, Rouge removed her toe just enough so it still brushed against your face. \u201cNow kiss and make up\u2026\u201d She teased. After what you had just went through\u2026you threw yourself at the damn toe and did a lot more than kiss. That was how much of a relief it was to be free of that immense pain Rouge could inflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge chuckled at how you reacted, \u201cGlad you\u2019re so enthusiastic. Cause it\u2019s time for you to start getting to work!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the life of you you had no idea which member of your family you were going to be spending the day with. All of them were bad but there were levels to it; your Mom was generally nice but she had her moments, December wasn't too bad either but if she's involved...then Rouge probably would be too. The worst case scenario was Melly who, in the glory of her teenage years had grown a mischievous side that rivaled Morgan's, and a quick lip for excuses. Two skills that brought nothing but trouble; with her there was a guarantee of you doing something degrading. And of course out of good, bad, and worse, you drew worst. Melly. You paled when Rachael explained that you were going to spend the day with her. Rachael seemed to notice; \"Oh it'll be okay. She only acted like that last time because she missed you.\" Boredly she got up and walked into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She <i> threw </i> me into her mouth and made out with her boyfriend! You have no idea how that feels!!\" A playful smile formed on Rachael's face, \"Actually...I sorta do. Remember?\" Her words brought forth one of your most favorite memories ever, your fifth anniversary with Rachael. She figured it would be a good gift to do what you had just described Melly doing, only instead of another man it was a second woman. Rachael's friend from college actually. With you between their lips the two made out and allowed their tongues to engulf you....it was....<i> awesome. </i> Even when both tongues were as large as a mountain they belonged to two amazingly beautiful women, and you got to experience it in all the glory....you just wished you could've also seen it from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your dopey smile very obvious Rachael blushed a bit, \"Anyway Melly won't do that to you anymore. She's older and more mature now. You have to let go of how she treated you when she was a baby.\" Ugh...Melly's baby years...or as you nicknamed it \"Nam\" after Vietnam. Back in those days December was almost as bad as Rouge, Rouge was...the same, your Mom was a tad moody, and of course Melly was a baby and knew no better....twas a dark time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say your dopey expression was gone quick, and you found yourself almost pleaing to your wife. \"Come on Rachael! Melly is as big a brat as ever! Can't I just spend the day with Morgan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still grounded from going to the beach with you between her toes....and knowing her she snuck out an hour ago.\" Rachael wore a weary smile, \"When she gets back I'll give her a talking too. But anyway- you aren't getting out of this mister!\" Ah...there was the pouty expression Rachael had since you met her. Cute and lovely to be sure, but when it came it always seemed an omen for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Rachael! Melly is a brat! She'll torture me! She's bad! She's-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING-DONG<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cursed, \"She's here isn't she?\" Rachael nodded and answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in the doorway stood Melly, still the same as you last saw her. Hazel colored hair about shoulder length, a cuteish beautiful face; the kind of girl who would be a knockout in a few years. But you saw through it all; deep down she was a little imp and the horns stuck out to you. She was wearing a nice big smile, \"Hiya Auntie Rachael! Where's big brother?\" Rachael gestured to her palm, where Melly eagerly searched for you. Finding you quick, \"Hiya bro! Tinier than ever I see! Hey, did you get smaller? Haha!\" If you weren't a tiny adult you would have hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome formalities were exchanged but to be honest you blocked it out, you were too busy thinking. Thinking of something you could do to get out of this...nothing was coming up as what could be called a \"Good\" plan. Before you knew it a dreadfully familiar shrill voice rang into your ears, \"Earth...Me to Brother!!\" Size joke aside, you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome way or another you and Melly were outside, you totally blocked out of leaving your wife and everything. She was walking down the street, thankfully she seemed moderately behaved for now. \"Hey Melly....what are we going to be doing?\" You made zero attempt to hide the fact you were upset. Whether she noticed or not though, Melly didn't show. \"Oh! I never did tell you did I? We're...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A chasm of darkness laid beneath you, in it was the metallic shine of hair clips and whatever else Melly needed on the spot. It was the shirt pocket on Melly\u2019s chest, her quickly developing chest. She noticed your worried looks, \u201cYeah, sorry Bro. I would put you somewhere else, but my skirt doesn\u2019t have any pockets; and anywhere else would just be sick. I mean, you are my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever stopped you before\u2026\u201d You mumbled suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly didn\u2019t hear you, \u201cSo again; sorry Bro.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound sorry in the slightest as her fingers released you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plummet wasn\u2019t anything new, you were still for a split second, you fell, and the cushion of Melly\u2019s pocket saves your life, although the hair pins made it a bit of a pain, especially when your head slammed into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d You worked your way to your feet woozily, quickly noting a weird indentation in the walls of your pocket-prison. It looked familiar, reminding you of December and Rouge for some odd reason\u2026then you realized, it was Melly\u2019s nipple! As Dad you only had one thought, <i>When did they get like that?! </i>Guys must\u2019ve been swooning over her\u2026brotherly protectiveness showed itself a bit, not that you had the ability to do anything anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly interrupted the brotherly moment, \u201cBrother, before I go you better hide in one of the hair pins. Otherwise one of them might crush you on the way.\u201d It seemed suspicious but, Melly was right. At your size, a slight tumble of one of those pins would pretty much end it; you stepped onto a conveniently placed one that required no climbing\u2026a purple one it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfectly like a teenager, Melly didn\u2019t bother checking up on you before taking off, in the distance you could hear a car blaring the new music of the decade, Melly\u2019s friends had arrived. Melly happily hopped in along with her small group. They started talking, but it was boring girl-talk so you started tuning out\u2026instead you began focusing on recalling Melly\u2019s group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Melly herself there was\u2026Sydney, a blonde preppy sort of girl who was actually rather smart. She seemed nice enough, but in your various adventures in Milly\u2019s clothing you learned she had a tendency to be a bit bossy, even domineering to an extent. All in all, a safe person to be with, 16-years old and relatively responsible, but she did give these weird glances whenever she saw you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was the senior of the group, their leader so-to-speak, Lauren. At 18 or 19, Lauren was quite a knockout, nice body, nice attitude,<i> very </i>smart, and best of all\u2026she wasn\u2019t evil a bit! She was the kind of girl you had to stop yourself from eyeing once in a while she seemed so perfect, D-Cups, long brown hair, attractive glasses, a bit of a nerdy anime side, smart, beautiful\u2026and not evil! Which was a big plus with your experience, not that you\u2019d trade her for Rachael. But you knew from experience, people like her tended to have stress issues, she probably was in desperate need of an outlet for it, which was the one thing that you made sure to remember about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast was the one friend you always worried about, Amber, the group goth. She had a style a bit like Ingrid\u2019s and Rouge\u2019s loose, gothy, revealing clothing, but unlike neither of them\u2026you had no idea how she was; she virtually never spoke around you; although, according to Melly she was quite a chatterbox when with her friends, which you soon found out one day in your sister\u2019s shoe. Her hair color tended to change weekly, last you saw it was blue; and her body\u2026maybe about Ingrid\u2019s sizes, C\u2019s or so. She made no effort to hide the looks she gave you, looks that almost looked\u2026<i>primal</i>, honestly, she scared you like Rouge did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the voices, it were these three friends Melly was with, and their destination; the Mall. Thankfully, Melly didn\u2019t go full on teenage girl yet, she wasn\u2019t risking endangering you, least not yet\u2026you found a small crevice in the hair pin to slide into for safe measure though. \u201cI can\u2019t wait til we get there!\u201d Melly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speak of the Devil.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Sydney cheered with Melly. In the background Lauren giggled while Amber sighed, one of those two whispered something, but with Melly and Sydney\u2019s shouts you only caught part of it and not who said it. \u201c\u2026Do you have it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly\u2019s body movement gave you the impression she was nodding, \u201cYeah! Just hold on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little light you had blotted out as Melly\u2019s fingers slid in, reaching for you. Escape efforts were futile, the hair pin assured that as Melly\u2019s pocket moved with her hand. You were left with no choice but to hold on for dear life to avoid falling and possibly dying from a falling hair pin. The pillar of Melly\u2019s finger gently grazed the hair pin you were on, even grazing you a bit, not that she could\u2019ve felt that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the hair pin, and you out, \u201cHere you go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a soft smirk, Rouge softly clapped her hands together. \u201cYou know the drill; it\u2019s time for your morning exercise dear.\u201d Her hands vanished from view and from between the vast moons that were the woman\u2019s breasts you could hear clicks, the sound of her undoing her bra. A couple clicks rang in your ears when the tight purple underwear flew off with a soft pop; Rouge\u2019s enormous breasts seemed to jump out at the freedom of open air, constantly wearing bras two-sizes too small tended to do that after all. The sudden motion couldn\u2019t help but knock you off your feet as the breasts slowly jiggled to a stand-still. Your memories were still playing catch-up though, what did Rouge mean by \u201cMorning Exercise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she seemed to notice the confusion or grew impatient, (Probably the latter) because Rouge\u2019s deep, seductive voice seemed to explain. \u201cGo on, start climbing. You\u2019ve already wasted a minute, only nine left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nine minutes?! I\u2019m on a time limit?!</i> You didn\u2019t think about it anymore, when Rouge gave a time limit she tended to follow through on the penalties for failing; even if you couldn\u2019t quite remember the penalty you knew you didn\u2019t want it, so you began climbing Rouge\u2019s right breast. It was what she wanted you to climb\u2026right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo climb a breast, a foot, or even a toe, none of it was new. You grab a good hold of the squishy flesh; hoist yourself up, and repeat; much harder than normal climbing since flesh wasn\u2019t exactly stable; much harder because Rouge\u2019s breasts were nothing but a squishy mass. Regardless, with your experience over the years, you climbed. It felt odd though, your body felt\u2026<i>weak</i>, out of shape, beaten even\u2026You guessed that in this\u2026reality or whatever it was, it was just an effect of being Rouge\u2019s\u2026.<i>husband</i>, still, it impeded your progress a bit. Thank heavens a couple of feet up you reached a wrinkle, likely from Rouge sleeping in a way that pushed something against her, but to you it served as a solid area you could climb much easier than the rest of her breast, when you reached it your pace picked up considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d Rouge giggled, tapping the clock beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her, focusing more on working out your memories. You married Rouge\u2026there was about three years of just you two and then\u2026.yeah, she was horny one night; and in a perverted impulse, strapped you to a dildo and proceeded to pleasure yourself. Inside her woman parts you ended up spreading your seed\u2026and somehow it landed and <i>blessed</i> Rouge with a daughter, a daughter she named Sarah. Right off the bat Rouge tutored Sarah on how to properly treat you, in fact; by the time she was one her first word was torture, and by two her first sentence was \u201cLick my feet\u201d Rouge was so proud. Now she was about 19, heading to college and living home. She had dark purple hair and a pale-ish beautiful complexion like her mother; and she seemed to pick up on her dress habits a boot too, tight fitting outfits, miniskirts, and boots, barely covering a figure that, believe it or not, <i>surpassed</i> her mother\u2019s. That wasn\u2019t all that surpassed her mother\u2019s too, she was more creative, she had tortures you never even imagined possible. Oddly enough\u2026in a weird way, you loved Sarah to death\u2026and even weirder still, it seemed like you didn\u2019t\u2026<i>completely</i> hate Rouge, maybe even loved her too\u2026was this how you were in a life with Rouge? Tortured but happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears passed with Sarah\u2026and her tortures grew worse, as did Rouge\u2019s as a way of keeping her power over you. Eventually Rouge grew tired of keeping the place clean for you and Sarah, (Which she didn\u2019t anyway, she made Sarah and you do it, and in turn, Sarah made you do it.) So to ensure the house stayed clean, she hired a housekeeper, a maid named Evelyn. She was actually Rouge\u2019s old college roommate, but, from what you can tell, Rouge basically stole what would\u2019ve been her job, and, without any backup plans for herself, ensured Evelyn a miserable life, her current one. When Rouge found out she of all people ended up a maid, she made sure to hire her, just for the humiliating satisfaction. She tended to take out her life\u2019s misfortune not on Rouge, but you, which only added to Rouge\u2019s pleasure of having her. Evelyn was actually quite a beautiful woman, with a fair figure, dark brown hair, C-Cup\u2019s, fair tan and well toned muscles, and even a nice woman; she just needed you as an outlet for venting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those three merciless torturers you were beaten, humiliated, and looked down on for the better half of your life, never finding it even the slightest bit tiring or repetitive. And yet, you still had that weird happiness. Did Rouge break your will or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne minute\u2026\u201d Rouge sounded gleeful, not that you understood why. Climbing her whole boob in ten minutes was impossible, even if you couldn\u2019t remember the details, making it an inch or two had to be satisfactory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she so happy abo-</i> Suddenly you remembered, and realized how much you underestimated the Demoness\u2019 black heart.  The details of your morning exercise, it was her breast; that much was what you did right, ten-minutes was always the time limit. But, Rouge never once failed to punish you for not making it to the top. Often chiding how you were lazy and needed to be whipped into shape, it was just a playful excuse to see you try and fail for her every morning, the ultimate morning show. You couldn\u2019t bring yourself to climb anymore, you should\u2019ve known better, you shouldn\u2019t have played along; but you did, and it was time to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime\u2019s up!\u201d The giantess eagerly reached for you, picking you up with her continental purple-painted nails. There were shined, shined to the point you could see your reflection, what you saw was a beaten man who appeared starved, beaten, and overall unhealthy. It was enough to make you feel sorry for the man as if he were a stranger, but he wasn\u2019t, he was you. You didn\u2019t have the will to fight it as Rouge lifted you up and mocked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFailed again I see. Even after I let you sleep between the girls! I let you out of your nylon-bed and let my feet get all cold over the night just for this too! Honestly, sometimes I swear you\u2019re just worthless. But its okay, I\u2019ll make sure to make you into something worthwhile.\u201d She winked, bringing you closer to her lips. <i>\u201cLove you\u2026\u201d </i>Her stank morning breath made you gag as two colossal purple lips threatened to engulf your entire being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you away, smiling. \u201cLet\u2019s start toughening you up mister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled as Rouge plotted your torture.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the words came out of Rouge's large mouth you found yourself paling. Rouge expected you to spend all of your energy rubbing her feet right away? She wasn't a devil for nothing, but that idea didn't lower your dismay any. You hoped she was just joking but these newfound memories, coupled with Rouge's incoming fingers told you such was not the case. Rather rough yet elegantly Rouge's massive fingernail scooped you right from her cleavage. Out of the canyon you saw she was clad in nothing but bra and panties, and as much as it pained you to accept it; she was still unrealistically beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you sat down on Rouge's purple fingernail and tried to sort this out. You still had memories of being with Rachael...and yet...you had all these memories with Rouge too. You couldn't tell which were right. You had to go back to the beginning of it all...your birth...your school years...they were basically the same. Up until one day...Rachael seemed to have a break down, and Rouge took over...and somehow you were forced into marriage. Far from a happy one at that, day in and out Rouge expected to be treated like a Goddess. If you were a good \"Husband\" you got rewards like sleeping in her cleavage, being bad tended to screw you over. Years passed like this, and in these memories you soon resigned yourself to this fate...and then came along kids...the same kids you had with Rachael? Same in appearance and everything, only...with a new Mom their attitudes were NOT what you liked. What the hell was going on? You had two lives in your head, what was this the Twilight Zone?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather violent shaking on Rouge's part disrupted your thoughts; forcing you from under her fingernail towards the foot of the bed. A good thirty foot drop; only letting you live due to the springs in the bed. It was only one strong, painful landing but you were alive...you hoped. Rising to your feet your jaw dropped; right before you were without a doubt the two most beautiful feet you had ever seen, taken care of unrealistically well. You weren't a foot man but...it was nice, sad it's owner was a complete demon. The last thing you wanted was to start massaging these feet, each tall enough that you could never hope to climb one in a full month, but for some reason...your body began moving of its own accord. Before you even realized it, your hands...no your whole body was rubbing itself against Rouge's towering foot, allowing all sweat and smell to come upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your head you were still confused about all this, what was going on?! Was this a dream?...Was your life with Rachael a dream? Were you somehow sent into some other world? None of this made any sense! All you did know...was this you did <i> NOT </i> like this situation at all. A life where every second you were Rouge's slave. It was hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like...tears were sliding down your cheeks....they weren't but...it felt as if they were, it was odd. But, somehow you knew, deep down that you were going to be living this life for a long time. With each passing second your hands wiped away more stress from Rouge's soles, absorbed more sweat, and humiliated you further. This sucked!!! And to make things worse you just knew from these memories and intuition  that Rouge was simply high on power from this, getting the Goddess treatment she desires constantly...ugh it was disgusting. All through your life you had known her she was like this, dressing in those tight leather outfits that revealed her cleavage. Always wearing bras too small so they looked bigger...born with beauty unrivalled. Her whole goth thing even at her age...she was amazingly hot but Rouge made it up with no morals...you headbutted her foot a few times in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong dear?\" God the way Rouge said that irritated you, more like she made a last second change to pet if anything. \"You aren't licking, kissing or even having sex with my foot...I do think someone's gotten a tad spoiled. Heck, you aren't even applying any real force there either!\" All of the things she mentioned...you never would've done them but...in your Rouge filled memories you had, you were broken...and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll have to remind you why I'm in charge around here!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With each word coming out of her mouth you found yourself starting to cower whereas Rouge began to smile more and more. Rouge was bad to be sure; but you hated her. It would be a hell of a lot more heartbreaking to have to endure such torment from your own beloved children...and these new memories made it obvious that they were as bad as Rouge. The two daughters you had grown to love so much...in this twisted world they were essentially Rouge Jr's, and your shrunken self was essentially their slave in every sense. It would've broken your heart to see your children so evil, you couldn't handle it and didn't want to face it. No matter what. In your desperation you began clinging to the never ending form that was Rouge's foot. \"Please Rouge!! I would do anything!!\" You so desperately didn't want to experience your daughters you licked and kissed the foot as if it were your true love in life. And for a moment you thought that submission was enough to satisfy the devil, it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as your guard lowered slightly an enormous purple surface....Rouge's fingernail, came from behind and scooped you away from her feet. \"Ah ah ah, too late hubbie. You have to learn your lesson; but don't worry. Later on you can worship my feet all you want. If you're really well behaved I'll even let you get in a quickie with my toes, I know how much that turns you on.\" If you were into domination and more importantly, feet to that extent you might have considered Rouge's offer a bit pleasant. But that not being the case you found yourself cringing, because you knew full well Rouge was going to follow through on those words later. And being the devil, Rouge brought the term rough to a whole new level. Hell, each time you practically cried for days at the agony disturbing you in your nethers. But even that idea didn't come close to the heart break you know you would feel at how your daughters in this twisted life acted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ingrid! Morgan! Get your butts down here! Daddy's been bad again!!\" Like perfect Rouge clones both daughters, looking exactly like you always knew them, came in running. Together they stood before their mother with wide smiles and eager expressions; truly it was a twisted world when your own beloved daughters would act like this for a chance to torture you...well with Morgan it wasn't too surprising to be honest.Still; Ingrid was a real heart breaker to this deal. From the edge of Rouge's finger nail you looked at them, both with their hands outstretched for their pet/father. No doubt an effect of Rouge's questionable parenting. You relied on your newly found memories to try and remember how they acted, the result was not favorable. Morgan...well she kept on doing what she was doing before; but it lost the facade of pranks and the playful air about it. It was much more like a dominating evil than playful fun. And Ingrid...well now not only did she look like Rouge; she <i> acted </i> like her. She had more than once proclaimed herself as your God, and that all you were useful for was to pleasure her....Kinda memorable to Rouge a few years back actually...Still, now both daughters were cold and saw you as little more than a personal slave; and Rouge had done an unfortunately amazing job of teaching them how to properly enjoy you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still hurt to see your beloved daughters so happy at the idea of torturing you though, memories, be they real or not, never beat experiencing it at that moment...and boy the experience hurt. And it just felt all the worse that you knew Rouge was more than proud of her daughters. \"Okay you two, Daddy's been bad and I dunno what to do...so I'll let one of you handle that. You can share, play alone, whatever. But first we have to decide, who deserves Daddy more? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn perfect sibling rivalry form Ingrid and Morgan sprang out their arguements. Ingrid yelling something about how you would submit to her feet for the entire day and Morgan, something about her mouth and breasts...you kinda tried to block her's out. Both ideas sounded beyond horrible, and of course Rouge was proud. \"Good girl's, Momma loves you. But we need to decide, who's idea will help teach Dad his lesson while I'm at work?\" She smirked at both daughters, \"Ingrid, your feet are absolutely lovely since you use the techniques I taught you, and I'm sure your father would make a nice helper down there, and Morgan...I love how you get so into the kinky stuff despite the fact he's your Dad...meh...tough choice.\" Both daughters stared at Rouge with silent pleading eyes. You could practically see your future suffering in their irises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge lifted her finger and smirked at your form, \"You know what? I think I decided, but first. Honey, give your wifey a kiss before she leaves for work. Don't worry, when I get back I'll let you love me as much as you want, but for now. You just have to settle for a kiss.\" She didn't even bother awaiting you to try, not that you would...or that it was even possible. In a sudden move Rouge rubbed her fingers against her lips, more or less rubbing you against them as they puckered and covered you in mild saliva. You couldn't help but scream as your body worked its way into her lips further and further, you were more than small enough to fit into a wrinkle on them; and a small dab of lip gloss would stick you to them forever. That was a fate almost as bad as living under Rouge's toenail, and your memories told you how bad that was...still....even if the idea disgusted you...you were sort of aroused, and even kissed back. God you never felt more self loathing, but Rouge was still amazingly beautiful. Of course; just as the negatives seemed to fade and you sort of enjoyed your position, Rouge handed you to one of your daughters and left in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around was an enormous plain of hand, to your sides were walls that rose to the heavens...you were on a hand wrinkle. A shadow seemed to form an eclipse over your world though...the head of your would-be Goddess for the next seven or so hours. Ingrid or Morgan it didn't matter, either one of them torturing you would break your heart. And while the sheer distance between you and your Goddess daughter was great enough she was blurry, you could still tell that it was...</span></div></div>",

But then your new memories of this twisted world you were now trapped in brought horrible images. Ingrid was as bad as Rouge. Her beautiful face was molded into a sneer as she looked down at you.\"Hello...<i>Daddy</i>.\"She boomed, the last word filled with such mockery it felt like a blow to the gut to you. What had happened to your loving daughter who would defend you from being crushed? Who would lovingly ask you what you wanted to do, and not her. Now, in this reversed reality, you were the slave, and Ingrid was your Gothic Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked upstairs to her room, promptly slamming the door shut and locking it. It's not as if you could escape, she just wanted her privacy with the microscopic slave if Morgan tried to steal you away. She sat down on her bed, removing her boots and settling you on top of her right big toe. As if on top of the tallest mountain in the world, you felt hundreds of miles up in the air atop the toe, and Ingrid's body an entire world stretching out before you. Her face still smirking at you, her thunderous voice commanding you your first task.\"Since I'm feeling kind today,\"She sounded so much like Rouge, even micking her tone of domination.\"I'll take it easy on you. All I want is for you to clean my big toe....\"She wiggled it, causing cataclysmic earthquakes that made you faceplant right into the soft ground.\"With your entire body. Use your arms to pick off the lint, use your tongue to rid of the dirt, and tackle the other bits to get them off.\"She said, making you pale at the task ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, but knew from these new memories you were a broken, defeated, tiny man. You begin to rub your body along the ground, following the instructions Ingrid bidded. The challenge seemed impossible given your size. When you came across your first piece of lint, usually invisible to the normal sized human, it was as large as an entire city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you had gotten rid of the lint piece. Apparantly Ingrid had gotten bored watching you, and had taken up to reading a magazine while you were cleaning her big toe. Standing back, exhausted, an idea popped into your head.</span></div></div>",

The poking continued until you were annoyed to the point of sitting up. Rubbing sleep from your eyes, you blink a few times, confused. A woman who appeared to be exactly your size, 1/100th of an inch tall, was standg in front of you, grinning. You blink a few more times to make sure this wasn't a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello...\"You greet her weakly, a tad confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\"She chirped, walking towards you and embracing you in a hug. It was...nice. Usually a hug ended up with you nearly crushed.\"I can't believe it! You actually exist!!\"She adds after releasing the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm 1/100th of an inch tall, impossible, but it's true. And you...are you real?\"You ask, poking her. She slapped your hand away playfully.\"Of course I'm real! I just never thought that....\"She carried off.\".....There would be another person my size.\"You both say at the same time. A grin was shared between you. Introductions came next. Her name was Alice Sims, and her story was shockingly similiar to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was raised with only one Mother, but two brothers, kind of the reversed side of your small life. The two of you shared stories of how hard it was being microscopically small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you hate it when your sibling drops you into their shoe?!\"She exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how long I've spent trapped beneath my own Mother's foot!\"You reply, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how long I've spent inside my brother's soccer cleats. Trust me, a guy's foot is a million more times worse than women's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kind of dialogue continued for what seemed like hours. You looked off in the distance, your landscape of a wife still snoozing peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....\"You finally asked.\"How did you even get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to relate her epic quest. It seems she had heard of you from watching the television, and she just had to meet you. She only lived a town over, a good hour or two car ride for normal-sized humans, a month's journey for Alice. She escaped her home, carrying a customized backpack of provisions. She had hitched a ride onto a lady's high heel, and she arrived in your own home town by bus. After that, she wandered on the sidewalk for days, narrowly dodging being stepped on or becoming eaten by insects. She got lucky when a group of teenage girls passed by, and it just so happened that one of the girl's was your daughter Morgan. After climbing onto your daughter's titanic flip-fopped foot, she clung to the pinky toe, taking ever jarring step to your house. She had spent the next few days exploring the hallways, finally reaching your room and climbing the very bed you rested on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that your wife,\"She pointed at the Giga Giantess miles away.\"Nearly sat on me like, three times?!

And since she wasn't magnified by a million times, that was double the points. She was slender with fair skin, cute c-cup breasts covered by a sweater and nice legs by blue jeans. Her hair was cropped short to just below her ears, her hair a shade of dark brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, instantly looking away. You were married! You couldn't possibly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yet, you did. As you laid naked an hour later, an equally nude Alice laid beside you, grinning.\"Oh God...\"You mutter, shame filling your tiny insides. Suddenly, earthquakes rattled you both. Rachael was waking back up.</span></div></div>",

Both you and Alice nearly fainted, turning ghastly pale. There was no time to hide, no time to even move before Rachael\u2019s eyes started fluttering open. All you and\u2026well you guess she\u2019s your girlfriend now; all you could do was watch in horror as Rachel\u2019s deep  brown irises reflected your own shameful image back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first words were disgruntled, \u201c\u2026Morni-\u2026.Huh? Who\u2019s this hunny?\u201d A monolithic hand brushed sleep out of her eyes, and she took a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell um\u2026dear\u2026this is Alice\u2026\u201d The fellow tiny gave a shy, if not scared, wave towards your much bigger, much more terrifying wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t fully wake her up, seeing a tiny woman did little to alert Rachael; but that quickly ended when she noticed you two were naked. \u201cOh my God\u2026baby\u2026you didn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Rachael I can ex-\u201cThose were the wrong words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael\u2019s voice rose to what would be defined as a scream, to you\u2026you could you\u2019re your eardrums bursting a bit. \u201cShut it you cheating\u2026you cheating fuck! I love you\u2026I married you! I\u2019ve been with you for over a decade and you\u2026you do this?! Am I not good enough for you now or something?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to appease the giantess as Alice wisely sidled to her clothes. \u201cLook hunny, it just sort of\u2026happened. There was no romance behind it!\u201d You could feel Alice staring daggers at you now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, two angry women!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael didn\u2019t even seem to notice your words, \u201cFine! If it\u2019s some woman you\u2019re after, I\u2019ll give you some woman! <i>More </i>than you could ever want!\u201d It seemed like a blur of movement as Rachael sat upright and scraped you and Alice off with her fingernail, laying you both on the bed sheets. Above loomed Rachael\u2019s moon-sized, red panty-clad, rear, there was no time to panic, no time to even register the situation. Alice gave you a tight, fear-filled, embrace as it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael sat on you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\nThe feeling of getting sat on was not one you were used to; many of the women you\u2019ve had to deal with over the years often found you unworthy of their butts, probably a good thing really. But it left you\u2026<i>unprepared </i>for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve had to experience the weight of a foot, the weight of a tongue, even the weight of spit at one point, but none of it seemed to compare to the weight of Rachael\u2019s well-toned butt. With a foot one can control the pressure well, but like this Rachael was applying full force; in fact, if not for the bed below you probably would\u2019ve been crushed. But you were fortunate enough to not be crushed\u2026only in severe pain. There was no escaping it either, all around was darkness; Rachael\u2019s butt blocked out the light itself. Any struggles you and Alice did seemed to do nothing more than tickle the giantess, who laughed at your ploys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this enough woman for you hubbie? Let me give you more just in case!\u201d She added pressure, even beginning a bit of a rub down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear God if you thought it was bad before, it was like the Indian Burn from hell, the friction of your entire body rubbing between Rachael\u2019s cheeks, and the bed below, seemed to melt your very bones. And not just that, but both you and Alice were slowly getting squished into the firm cheeks of Rachael, likely a spot you\u2019ll never return from. In desperation the two of you clasped hands and held for one another, but against Rachael the bond didn\u2019t even last a minute. You were pushed deep into her butt, so deep that the opening narrowed to almost nothing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment you remembered the oddest thing, scenes from television where a woman realized they were getting cheated on. Cop Dramas, Comedies, Movies, no matter what it always seemed to bring about a temporary insane rage. You shrugged it off as a mere Hollywood thing, and it seemed you were beyond wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael meanwhile, was having the time of her life. To literally have  that cheating bastard and his bitch underneath her\u2026it was a rush, almost enough to make her wet even. Their futile struggles are what made her wet; hell, she was halfway tempted to throw them both into the depths of her pussy and let them continue their little affair as she fingered herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut cheating bastard or not, her husband was her husband, she wouldn\u2019t kill him\u2026at least not yet. On that note, who was that woman? Rachael flipped out too soon to think to ask, another tiny? What were the odds? Those were the kind of odds that would bring up words like \u201cDestiny\u201d or \u201cSoul Mate\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not with MY husband you bitch! </i>Rachael gritted her teeth, adding a little more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere remained one thing though, Rachael couldn\u2019t shake the feeling she wasn\u2019t doing enough, that her actions weren\u2019t torturous enough. But what more could she do\u2026? She figured it out a moment later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My huge, smelly shoes!\" She smiled deviously. She walked over to her shoes and Alice was begging her not to do this. But Rachel only laughed. She dropped both of you each in one shoe. It were bright green high heels which she had borrowed from her cousin Noelle. You've met Noelle before and she wasn't exactly nice to you. You spend your whole weekend in the same heels Rachel was wearing now. The heels smelled like Noelle's feet. Rachel put on the shoes and you were underneath her toes. She walked towards her car and drove to work. Every step she took you were smashed against her toes and the smell became unbearable. Rachel walked into her office and sat down at her desk. She wiggled her toes and felt satisfied. You on the other hand felt like your world was collapsing. Rachel slowly lost her feeling of satisfaction and only felt angre. She took off her shoes and plucked you and Alice out. \"I decided that I'll get rid of you.\" She said and Alice grabbed you in fear. \"I'll find a place where nobody will ever find you.\" She smiled \"but where?\" Suddenly, an intern named Lisa walked in. She had a light brown skin, brown hair,  normal sized boobs but a beautiful and big ass. She walked into the office with a report in her arms. She was wearing low waist pants, a low cut tank top and high black heels. Lisa put the papers on Rachel's desk but accidentally dropped her pencil,  which rolled behind her. She bent down to pick it up, showing a sea of buttcrack. Rachel smiled deviously and said \"bye bye!\" You looked at Alice and realised that you love her.

It was 10:30. Lisa didn't enjoy being an intern, but it would be worth it when she officially started working fulltime. She sat down and got to work organizing documents while her stomach rumbled and slipped out a silent fart before looking at the first sheets of papers that needed to be organized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Your PoV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's ass hairs toward like trees around you an Alice. The scent of ass along with the faint smell of soap was the air around you. The ground, Lisa's flesh was constantly radiating heat and the ground shook as she walked. They could hear the voice of their unwitting captor booming above them, but couldn't make out a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Alice said, \"We can't live like this! We have to try to get out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will.\" You said,\" And we'll get back at Rachel for what she did to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy!?\" Alice exclaimed, \"She'll probably do worse to us if we mess with her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were caught off guard by loud, but muffled groan which shook the ground and seemed to be coming from deep within Lisa's gut. You and Alice saw the wrinkly creator that was undoubtedly Lisa's anus out in the distance. The flesh spasmed and twitched ominously as another small earthquake hit. The hair near the epicenter of the putrid flesh swayed rapidly. Droplets of sweat warbled and shook and slid further into the dark hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held Alice's hand and grabbed hold of the nearest hair you could find as the crater shook more violently and rose, forming itself into an ominous mountain that opened. There was a hissing sound and brownish-green smog flowed out of the fleshy mountain of Lisa's asshole. Along with the smog, an overwhelming and unbearable scent of rotten eggs and ass filled the air along with the putrid gas. Most shot straight up into the sky that was the fabric of Lisa's thong, but some of it had enveloped the stale environment of her buttcrack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Alice chocked on the fumes as you held each other tight. As Lisa's asshole continues to release the gas building up her large intestine, a thunderous farting sound shook the air around you and you both watched in disgust as a foul substance erupted from the hole at the top. The brownish, translucent substance flowed down the mountain when the fart finally stopped and the flesh sank down to its natural position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal bodily function was like a cataclysmic event to you and you knew you and Alice were overstaying your welcome in this fleshy prison. Rachel was going to pay for this and you were more than willing to get revenge, but Alice was freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i-I've been sat on many times before, but I've actually never been farted on or seen a fart up close before y'know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman curled up into a ball and started rocking back in forth. She was nearing a mental breakdown and her speech was rapid. \"I've never even seen the human anus before until now. I've never actually been in people's mouths before. I've been really fortunate so far. Food goes up there to be converted into shit that comes out here. Can you imagine, Matthew? Being chewed to bits and-and-and converted into waste? That sounds really fucking scary. It's a miracle people our size have even survived this long, I mean can you imagine-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALICE!!\" you yelled and shook her. You couldn't have her freaking out on you now. She would go insane plus it makes life harder for you. You had to assume that this the first real-time in her life where she felt like she was in serious danger too and couldn't handle the thought of staying in a woman's ass for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will get out of this, we just need a plan,\" you said to her calmly. \"We'll get out of here, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm sorry,\" Alice said and stood up. \"I, I just never had anyone look at me with the hate your wife had for me. For, us.\", \"I mean, I've had other girls become jealous of me and bully me before. They would put me in their shoes, sit on me. This one girl even spit on me so she could watch me swim through her saliva for kicks with her friends, but I never imagined anything like this happening to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was the jealous type, but she was never this severe or frightening. You had remembered that look in her eyes as well. It was real, genuine anger. She was convinced that you were cheating on her when she saw Alice with you. That, or she was the one cheating and acted out her guilt in the worst way possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Alice felt your world shake again as Lisa started to move around. You could both hear the quaking and shifting of her asscheeks. The loud, but muffled booming from of her voice echoed around you. The woman with the huge ass wasn't tormenting you on purpose. Lisa was completely unaware of your presence as she went about her work-day and her body was just doing what it normally did. If possible, you could escape and try to get her attention, but trying to do so now might be too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do now? </span></div></div>",

Today was December\u2019s birthday, and she was having a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we really have to go?\u201d you yelled over to Rachel. \u201cCan\u2019t we just make up some excuse that we can\u2019t make it? Like you can\u2019t find me or something? Or I died?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed out of bed, and the vibration caused you to fall of the thread you stood on. You were able to grab hold and slowly started pulling yourself back up.<br>\r\nHer loud, thundering voice responded. \u201cShe\u2019s your sister. Do you have no respect for your family?\u201d She was standing up, and seeing her figure in just a t-shirt was both arousing and\u2026terrifying. You knew exactly that dread form the way she was looking at you. She was not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like December has a ton of respect for me. You know Rogue is going to be there without a doubt. The fact that she has remained friends with that demon and brings her round me all the time\u2026doesn\u2019t really seem to show any concern for my safety at all. Remember how awful things went last year with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do, and I saved you last year. Don\u2019t you trust me to take care of you? Everyone is always looking after you, always taking care of you. Especially me and your family, and we can't have a normal life because of it. IF we don't go, they will harass us to no end?\u201d Rachel walked off to the bathroom and shut the door to get ready. All you could hear was the thunderous roar of the shower in the bathroom. It was only a matter of time before she got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",
