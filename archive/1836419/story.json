But as she swallowed the single bite from the tiny, light green cap, she couldn't feel anything happening. \"Wonderful,\" she thought to herself, \"I think I have to eat the whole thing.\" With her eyes beginning to water from the horrid stench of the surrounding mushrooms, she pinched her nose shut and popped the rest of the mushroom into her mouth, chewing it carefully and then swallowing. She was relieved to find that the flavor seemed to improve when she could block out the smell, even if it did give the rubbery fungus a cardboard-like taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it traveled down her throat and hit her stomach, Alice could immediately feel that something about the mushroom was beginning to disagree with her body. Feeling slightly nauseated and with her stomach rumbling and groaning loudly, she clutched at her abdomen. Something was happening inside her, but she couldn't tell what; it didn't feel like she was going to throw up, and she certainly didn't need to use the bathroom, but she still felt that something was certainly not normal. Moving over towards a large stone, she sat down, hoping that something would happen and that she could escape. But her stomach kept rumbling, and she began to feel a strange pressure in her gut, traveling up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the stone and leaning back slightly, Alice placed a hand on her chest, opened her mouth, and let out a small burp. \"Urp!\" It was quick, and not very loud, but the pressure remained inside her, and it was followed almost immediately by another, bigger one. \"Uuurrrp!\" Finally, twisting her face slightly, Alice gave a heavy, rolling belch that seemed to erupt from her throat with the volume and tone of a drunken sailor, \"UUUUUURRRRRPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure in her stomach had eased up after this impressive eructation, and Alice breathed heavily, surprised at what had just happened. This was a strange effect for mushrooms to have in Wonderland...</span></div></div>",

I can't- BUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPP<br>\r\nShe cut him off by belching loudly on him once more, the stench leaving her mouth as a dense greeny-brown cloud.

Swallowing it with watering eyes, she grimaced, \"Ugh! They taste just like they smell...\" She set the remainder of the nasty mushroom down and waited for a moment, hoping the effect would take hold soon. Sure enough, within a few moments she felt a strange sensation washing over her body. Her vision began to warp and waver, blurring and flashing into brilliant clarity again, all the while with colors and shapes dancing across everything she saw. Her surroundings seemed to spin slowly, dizzying her and causing her to stumble, and finally she feels it happening...</span></div></div>",

She slowly adjusted herself, and nothing was altered in her, besides the horrible rubbery taste of the mushroom she consumed, nothing seemed off. She shuffled and sat up, rubbing her eyes, and feeling a particularly bizarre feeling inside her. She gave a small groan as she gripped her stomach, the source of the bizarre feeling creeping up inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventuslly, a small little belch came through her mouth, as she felt her stomach feel filled and heavy. It was un-noticed by her, but her stomach had puffed out and softened a bit, along with the rest of her body growing a bir of weight, but to Alice, she still had the feeling of pressure despite fulfillment. Another few belches came out her mouth, and some gas came out her rear, she was quite a bit gassier... but every moment, her stomach and body filled out more and more, until eventually....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>URRRRRRRRRP!</b>\" came a triumphant belch from Alice. The pressure in her left, and she finally felt much better! Of course her body was now quite a bit... bigger. She had begun to grow a double chin, and a rather chubby stomach stood. Her thighs had thickened, and her arms plush. Of course, Alice hadn't noticed this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now,she was filled with an empty feeling... hunger? What could she do??</span></div></div>",
