Abide by these rules: (1) go in and face the wall with your back to the closed door (remember to close the door); (2) keep your eyes wide open and focused on the wall, if there are obstacles such as clothing in your vision, move them to the sides; (3) clear your mind of your fears and a solution for escape will come to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax carried out the acts according to the rules and for a moment felt as though he were being watched.  Was this some prank from his older brother, Henry?  They never got along but could Henry be this devious?  No, he wasn't that smart!  Henry never finished college and now was working in his own business in his own little world having mom and dad support him.  What was going on?  OH!  I'm in an episode of Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone'...yeah, that's it!  \"Ok guys you can quit the act, I'm not buying it.  I want out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of flourescent coloring shows on the back wall of the closet.  Max moves closer to try and read the writing.  It's in a language he knew years ago; only he and Julie knew this secret code.  It couldn't be Julie because she died in a car crash last June after her brother's wedding reception.  He and Julie had been neighbors, best friends since kindergarten and even sweethearts until they went away to college and she married the Basketball Captain at Albany State and Max delved himself into this writing career.  Who was doing this to him?  I'm digressing, he thought.  I need to remember the code and figure this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbols on the wall resembled a cross between Wiccan and Pagan Futhark Celtic Writing.  All he could make out was, 'beware the ghost for he is as foul in death as he was in life'.  Ok.  So who else did Max know of that died?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRrrinnggggg! Startled, Max jumped to the side.  He forgot his cell phone was on.  A deep raspy voice, of course, came over the line and said, \"So my brave writer, have you figured out the riddle?  I'm waiting to be released and I cannot be released until you figure out the riddle.  SO WHAT'S THE ANSWER?  I grow impatient for freedom myself.\"  Although the voice was disguised, Max recognized it!  So, they wish to play this game, fine I'll play along.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well now, that was a nice little nap,\" you comment to yourself as you roll out of bed. You'd rarely been allowed to sleep this long before, your parents always insistent that you were out of bed sometime before ten o'clock in the morning no matter what day of the week it was, but obviously something had gone wrong today, otherwise you would have woken up to your mother yelling at you about being a lazy good for nothing, then apologizing and saying she didn't mean it and promising to make you your favorite breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at those memories you yawn as you get out of bed, and start as, for the first time, you realize you're not alone. In one corner of your room there stands a figure, still as stone, and wearing a robe that seems to blend into the surroundings, especially thanks to his immobility. Looking closer you find that the man is barely breathing, his chest, which you had noted lacked the proper accessories to be a female's, was rising only every other moment, and falling less than that. For a few minutes you sit there, thinking the man might be dead or something, but then all at once he stirs, and the hood of his robe falls back to reveal a face that wouldn't have looked out of place in a highschool, though he wore the look of someone a bit older than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, finally up are you? That's quite a snore you've got on you boy,\" comments the man with a laugh as he starts to walk closer to you, and you instinctively pull back, not about to trust some stranger that just suddenly appeared in your room before you awoke, probably having done something to your mother and father already. Yet if he'd done that why had he let you sleep all this time? He could have taken you out at any moment he chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no I couldn't have. You're powers, like my own, are instinctive. You would have defended yourself even more powerfully than if you knew how to use your powers, really, because you wouldn't have been holding anything back in anticipation of my next blow,\" he explains to your unasked question, and you gasp at him, looking for something that appears to mark him as a mind reader, but seeing only a human man, with nothing special about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's just rude. I'm plenty special. If I weren't would I be able to read the narration?\" he commented cryptically, and then shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen my friend. I know none of this makes since yet, but if you'll trust me I can explain everything about this. Oh, and just so you know, I didn't do anything to your parents. Your powers awakened last night, and well, you sort of unwrote their reality. Don't worry though, it was an unskilled and crass technique at best. By the time we're done they'll be back safe and sound, and completely oblivious to what's going on,\" said the man, and then smiled at you, reaching out his hand.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't what you would call an average way to start your day, but then, who ever wanted to be average?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lead the way,\" you tell him, returning his smile as you place your hand in his, the bare skin of your palm tingling as it makes contact with his. Oddly you do not find this surprising. In fact, for some reason you had kind of expected it, as if your brain knew something that it wasn't telling the rest of your body, which was just plain weird, but kind of fit in with the theme of the whole of your day since waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that odd. It's called instinct, something most humans think they don't have any of, but they're wrong. If you need proof, step into a cold room,\" he said grinning at you as he though, \u2018and when you do, you'll get goose bumps, now follow me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" you say, knowing what he was going to say, despite his lips not moving. It was as if you had reached into his mind and started looking at it, like it was some kind of book, and just waiting to be looked at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, a very apt analogy, and almost exactly like that. The only thing you got wrong is that you weren't reading my thoughts, you were reading the narration, something you'll learn how to do more readily where we are going,\" he told you, and then stuck his hand into the air. It was the only way to explain it. It was like the air in front of him was some kind of pocket, and he just reached his hand inside, and then, with one smooth motion he opened it up, and the world around you vanished, dissolving into a whirlwind of words and letters that left you dizzy as you appeared...</span></div></div>",

In the distance you can hear police sirens wailing, and several shouts seemed to emanate from the same direction. It wouldn't have surprised you to have heard automatic gun fire, and turning to your guide you were about to ask him a question, but he was already walking down the alley, his robes vanishing as he moved, becoming what you could only describe as street clothes, and looking at your own night shirt you were not so surprised to find yourself similarly garbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, let me guess what your next words will be. You were expecting to arrive somewhere where the walls shone so brightly that they were blinding, and everything looked cleaner than a plate before a meal? It's true, some would flaunt their power in this way, but our kind doesn't need such flashy displays to know we're special,\" he answers you as he continues to walk, and you follow, increasing your pace as shots are fired behind you, the loud pops telling you they were handguns rather than semi automatics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry now,\" he instructed, and then suddenly someone appeared in front of him. It looked like someone you would have expected in such a place, dingy clothes, a knife in his hand, and a wild look in his eye, but before you could cry out the knife in his hand literally melted, and his clothes simply vanished, leaving him naked. In the next instance he was holding a cellphone, and the clothes he wore were that of what you could only call a businessman, who ignored you two as he walked off, chatting to someone on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor soul. A wife, three kids, and an ailing father to feed. His job lost because someone went and chopshopped his taxi,\" commented your guide as he shook his head and continued down the alley, suddenly descending a flight of stairs that were set so no one could see them until they were literally right on top of them. Walking up to the door the man who'd brought you hear tapped on it nine times, in a rhythm you remembered as being the morse code for SOS.</span></div></div>",

Interesting you notice that there seems to be two sets of eyes, or rather two images of them in the slot. The first is a pair of golden orbs that make you think of nothing save a wolf, and the other human, that seems to be a hazy mask over the first set, like something worn to hide the golden eyes beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I tell you, you're learning already,\" said your guide with a grin as he turned back to your for a moment and then returned his gaze to the eyes in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call upon this house in the name of those who speak of worlds that lay within the dream, but which become real when the sleeper refuses to wake,\" said the man almost mechanically, like it was some kind of code word, which you only just realized it had to be. Like those old speak easys in the twenties, during Prohibition, when people couldn't drink in the United States at all legally, and so had to hide such activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be you and your companion among those who live in the dream, or the world of reality?\" asked the eyes, and the man shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We live in neither, for our world is where the dream and reality touch,\" says the man, and the door opens wide to reveal you had been right about the eyes belonging to a wolf, though one that had the body of a man. An anthromorph, like the ones in the stories authors sometimes wrote, but this one, a red wolf, stood in the flesh rather than as words on a page, his six foot seven height, and almost nine if you added in his ears, staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is the one you were after? He doesn't look like much, but then, most don't,\" said the wolf as he wandered off, unconcerned it seemed as he left the door wide open for the two of you, and the man quickly stepped inside. Not seeing any reason to delay you decided to follow, and what you saw made you gasp in surprise.</span></div></div>",

And besides, she doesn't see this anymore.

Oh, and you know what, I don't think I've properly introduced myself to you yet, how rude of me,\" he told you, and then the Great and Powerful Sage of Stars Flared out his arms, a lens flare effect coming from behind him, and dramatic music playing from everywhere.

And by the way, Sage of Stars is way to long a name to call me. I prefer Star Sage as the shortened version, though some call me just Sage too,\" he explains as he leads you back along the halls, all the effects gone, and the man that had distracted you walking away as if he had seen none of it. Of course you don't even wonder now how you knew what his name was, though you did wonder why you hadn't known what the shortened versions were, after all you were reading his mind, weren't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already told you that's not what our kind do. We can see the script of the world, understand it in ways that other people can't, and alter it to make the lives of those we encounter better.

I am good at this, and so I have a lot of both, but still, I know some here who could easily best me. One day you two may have that kind of power yourself, though that day is a long way off,\" he comments in an offhand manner, as if he weren't even speaking to you anymore. All at once he stops and turns to a door, walking up to it with a purposeful stride and then turning the knob, and allowing the door to swing free slowly on its own, revealing the room within.</span></div></div>",
