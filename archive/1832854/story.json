He wanted to know, and also wanted to break the slightly awkward silence that had just fallen after the their last topic had gone awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, that. Or rather those. Alright, where do I start with these.......ah, I know! You keep up with the overseas Duel Monsters Champions?\u201d Joey begin to ramble. \u201cOnly with Rebecca.\u201d was Yugi\u2019s reply. \u201cI\u2019ve shifted focus, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cI know. Well, get this: the British Duel Monsters Champion, Edward Gale, was hospitalised a few days ago!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Yugi was kinda shocked by this. Was the overseas dueling that dangerous? \u201cHow so? Please tell me it wasn\u2019t via a Duel......\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope! His tea was poisoned. Heh, classical British......\u201d The idea of poisoned tea seemed funny to Joey....though his smile faded when he saw Yugi\u2019s disapproving stare. \u201cIt\u2019s the irony that\u2019s funny, Yug, not the dude getting hospitalised. Poisoned drinks are unhanded anyway. Besides, they don\u2019t know if he did it himself or if was done by someone else.\u201d He quickly explained, only getting an annoyed \u201cUh-Huh....\u201d from Yugi.<br>\r\n\u201cA-Anyway, it caused a big stir in the news.....and even more when the European Champion, Wallberto Kenny, basically acted like a total dick in response to the situation-\u201c \u201cEurope and Britain are different countries, Joey. What\u2019s one got to do with the other?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m getting to it, he basically bad mouthed the dude and called him a coward, accusing the Edward dude of poisoning himself to back out of an upcoming Duel he had with him in a few days time. Said something like, \u201cSuch a coward. He couldn\u2019t bear the idea of losing against me. No wonder he tried to take his life!\u201d Got attacked by not only Edward\u2019s fans, but turned a bunch of his own against him and got called out by the Asian Champion, Ramaja Xuju on social media.\u201d Joey offloaded to Yugi, who responded with a \u201cWow.....\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all.\u201d Joey continued. \u201cThis is where it gets gruesome. Two days ago, Wallberto was killed.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWait, WHAT?!<br>\r\n\u201cYep. Pinned to a wall by a sword straight through the heart. No one knows who done it. And then on the same day, Ramaja nearly got killed by a car accident! He was lucky to survive, though he broke his right arm in the process.<br>\r\n\u201cI......this is all terrifiying, Joey.....\u201d Yugi admitted. \u201cAnd it brings up a lot of questions....\u201d<br>\r\nBut before Yugi could ponder more, he was interrupted by someone.</span></div></div>",

Watch and be amazed. I summon Aligator Sword in attack mode. And then I end.<br>\r\nMy move. I activate the spell card, Final Countdown. Just then a ball of light appeared above them.

If you manage to defeat me before this card fully charges then you win.<br>\r\nHow long do I have?<br>\r\nAs of now. 18 turns.<br>\r\nThen I better get to work.

He was watching three of yugis dearest friends, Rebecca Hawkins, Tea Gardner, and Serenity Wheeler. The future duelist thought these girls could amuse him, so he approached to meet them. Meanwhile, the girls where talking about a movie they just watched.<br>\r\n \"My favorite part was when Jack jumped from the roof onto the RV to sav-\", Rebecca was talking when she noticed a figure approaching. \"Who's that?\", Serenity asked. \"I don't know\", Tea said in response to the obvious question. \"My name is not important, but of course I'm here for a reason \", the future duelist said. \"Why are you here?\", Rebecca asked. \"To duel you here and now, 3 on 1\", the duelist said.<br>\r\n The girls where surprised to say the least, 3 on 1 seemed too easy. But, they accepted anyway and armed themselves. Rebecca was nervous about the stranger, they didn't know his strength. Serenity was excited, she knew the rules, and can finally test her deck from yugi. Tea was confident, as they had the number advantage. \"Before we begin, shall I be the gentlemen and tell you my name after all? Its Valdor\", the duelist said.<br>\r\nValdor: 12000<br>\r\nTea: 4000<br>\r\nRebecca: 4000<br>\r\nSerenity: 4000<br>\r\n \"I will start this duel, seeing as I have the disadvantage in numbers\", Valdor said to the girls. \"I draw. I summon, Summoner monk! When he's summoned, he's switched to defense mode automatically.\" Def 1600. \"Next I use his effect, once per turn I send I spell from my hand such as this Half Shut spell. Once that's done, I can special summon a level 4 monster from my deck. But he can't attack this turn, not that he could anyway. I choose, Newdoria!\" Def 800. \"I discard Necro Gardna, to special summon The Tricky.\" Atk 2000. \"I set one card and end\", Valdor said.<br>\r\n \"I draw!\", Tea said. \"I set a monster, then I play pot of greed to draw two cards. I set two cards and I end\", Tea said.<br>\r\n \"My move, I draw\", Rebecca said. \"I summon, Mystic Tomato\", Atk 1400. \"I set two cards and I end.\"<br>\r\n \"Awesome, my move. I draw\", Serenity said. \"I activate Heavy Storm!\", serenity said as the spell destroyed all spell and traps on the field. \"Serenity! Be careful!\", Tea and Rebecca said in unison. \"Oops, sorry girls\", serenity said as the girls frowned. But then they noticed Valdor, he was fuming mad. \"I needed that DNA surgery, you insulent brat!\", Valdor shouted. \"Well, its gone now!\", serenity said. \"My next card is, Unshaven angler.\" Atk 1500. \"I activate double summon, tributing unshaved angler. His effect activates, when he's tributes for a water monster he's two tributes. I summon, white Knight dragon!\" Atk 3000. \"I end\", serenity said.<br>\r\n \"I draw\", Valdor said. \"I play pot of greed, drawing two cards. I play, mound of the bound creator, a field spell. I sacrifice my three monsters to summon, winged dragon of ra!\", Valdor said. Atk 11900. Valdor: 100. \"I attack Teas set monster\", Valdor said. \"My set monster was morphing jar, his effect activates. So we discard and get new hands\",tea said. \"Very well, I set two cards. But since ra destroyed your monster, you take 1000 points of damage from the field spells effect\", Valdor said. Tea: 3000. \"I play mystical space typhoon to destroy my field, dont ask why, now I end\", valdor said. Meanwhile, kenta, Han, and Z, were watching the duel from above on a roof. \"You know he's gonna do it, he always does\", Han said. The other two nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n \"Its my turn, I draw!\", tea said. \"I activate the trap rainbow life, discarding a card for its effect\", valdor said. \"What does it do?\", tea asked nervous. \"Your about to find out, but first my other trap: ring of destruction!\", valdor said. \"What?! We'll all lose!\", Rebecca shouted. \"Rainbow life will add this damage to my life points for this turn. So I am gonna survive, but you are not\", Valdor said as the ring went off. Valdor examined the life point counters, smiling coldly.<br>\r\nValdor: 12000<br>\r\nTea: 3000<br>\r\nRebecca: 0<br>\r\nSerenity: 0<br>\r\n \"What? Impossible, tea should have lost!\", valdor shouted. Tea revealed a card in her hand: damage ring. \"This quick-play spell card neutralized the damage to me, so its just us now\", tea said. Rebecca and Serenity were surprised, Han and Kenta were shocked, but Z was smiling at this turn of events.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was 7 PM, the sun had just set, and Seto Kaiba was <i>not</i> happy. He had just received the results of the latest test for a new piece of technology he had had his engineers working on for the past few months. It was supposed to be a way of making duels even more exciting by giving the holograms mass, allowing the duelists to, for example, climb on top of them of them and ride them. But, according to the most recent report, the circuitry of the system was messed up, since, like in the previous tests, it had suddenly started emitting sparks about halfway through the duel, and before he knew it Kaiba was throwing out almost a million dollars worth of top of the line tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba leaned back in his chair and sighed heavily. <i>\"Even when I set my standards as low as they can reasonably be, those idiots STILL manage to disappoint me,\"</i> he thought with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the intercom on his desk turned on, and he heard the voice of his secretary. \"Mr. Kaiba, sir? You have a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba growled and his forehead wrinkled. \"Tell them to get lost. I'm not interested in buying girl scout cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, he says he's here to discuss a possible business venture with you. He won't say anything more though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba paused at that. True, Kaiba Corporation was one of the largest companies in the world, but it wasn't <b>the</b> largest. At least, not yet. And who knows? Maybe this guy could help him expand even more. \"Alright, send him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed before the door to Kaiba's office opened, and in walked a man who Kaiba assumed was his visitor. He had long blonde hair that seemed disgustingly oily and went all the way down to his shoulders. His face was slightly sharp, giving him the appearance of an intellectual, and a simple pair of glasses rested in front of a pair of electric blue eyes. The man wore a silver jacket with blue highlights, a white shirt, and black pants. Upon his wrist he wore a strange, red device that had a blank black screen on top and seemed to hold a deck of Duel Monsters cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man closed the door behind him and approached Kaiba's desk. \"I assume you are Seto Kaiba?\" His voice was slightly high in pitch, indicating that he must be a young adult, no older than 20 or 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba nodded. \"That's correct. And you would be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man bowed as he spoke. \"My name is Kase Heiji, and may I say what an honor it is to be in your presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba smirked. \"A flatterer, huh? Well, unfortunately for you, sweet talk won't work on me. Now, let's talk business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase nodded. \"Yes, of course. But, if you wouldn't mind, I have a request before we get to work.\" A quirked eye brow prompted him to continue. Raising the device on his arm up, Kase said, \"If it isn't too much to ask, I would like to duel you. I usually get to know my partners before making any deals, and in your case, I think a duel is the best way to do that.\" He ended his sentence with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaib thought about it for a few second before sighing and getting out of his chair. He quickly walked over to a nearby display stand and grabbed the duel disk resting on it, his deck already secured within. \"This deal better be worth my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase chuckled as the two exited the office and called an elevator to take them to the KaibaCorp duel arena. \"Trust me, Mr. Kaiba. If all goes well, neither of us should be left wanting,\" he said as the elevator arrived, and the two stepped inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trip down to the arena was made in silence. The elevator's doors opened, blasting its occupants with a gust of cool air, and Kaiba and Kase began making their way to their positions on either end of the stadium. Once they were in place, Kase raised the red device on his arm and called out to Kaiba. \"I hope you're ready for this, Mr. Kaiba!\" A slot on the side of the device suddenly glowed, producing a black blade of energy with a bright blue outline. \"Because I'm not going to hold back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba's eye brows raised as he activated his own duel disk, the blades sliding and rotating into place. <i>\"Must be a foreign model.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET'S DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba: 4000<br>\r\nKase: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase grabbed the top 6 cards of his deck and added them to his hand. \"I hope you don't mind, Mr. Kaiba, but I'll be taking the first move.\" He looked down at his hand and winced slightly. He removed one of the cards and placed it on his duel disk while he spoke. \"I'll have to start by summoning Suanni, Fire of the Yang Zing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon-like being emerged from the ground, its body covered in red scales. It turned its lion-headed neck towards Kaiba and roared, though it failed to produce any noticeable reaction from the young CEO. <i>\"Yang Zing? I've never heard of those cards...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase grabbed two more cards and placed them face-down on his duel disk. \"Now I'll Set two cards, and I'll pass the turn to you. Don't disappoint me, Mr. Kaiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba smirked as he drew from his deck. \"I don't plan on it.\" He briefly scanned the cards in his hand before making his move. \"First, I'll summon Kaiser Seahorse in Attack Mode! Next, I'll activate the spell card Double Summon! And thanks to my Seahorse's effect, he can be used as two Tributes for the summon of a LIGHT monster! So now I'll summon my Blue-Eyes White Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA humanoid fish warrior appeared on Kaiba's field before it was engulfed in a bright light. As the light died down, Kaiba's field was now occupied by the white dragon of legend. It looked down on Kase's field and roared in the smaller dragon's face. Suanni merely glared back, its muscles tensing as it prepared to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my Blue-Eyes, destroy Suanni! White Lightning!\" The large dragon breathed in before launching a torrent of high voltage electricity from its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cone of lightning approached Suanni, Kase smirked and revealed one of his face-downs. \"I activated my trap, Yang Zing Brutality!\" Suanni roared, somehow much louder than Blue-Eyes, and flew straight into the attack. The electricty seemed to curve around its body as Suanni rapidly approached Kaiba's dragon. \"Whenever one of my Yang Zing monsters battles an opponent's monster, I can activate Brutality to increase my monster's ATK and DEF to double their original values! Which means this battle is ending in Suanni's favor!\" The red dragon flew into the white dragon's face and the two fought. After a moment, Blue-Eyes was sent crashing to the ground, exploding into shards as it landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba: 4000 --&gt; 3200<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Suanni landed, it suddenly convulsed in pain before exploding into shards as well. Kase sighed as he explained. \"However, the monster effected by Yang Zing Brutality is automatically destroyed once the battle ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba smirked. \"So you took out your own monster to get rid of mine? I can't tell if that brilliant or moronic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase glared at him. \"It's true that I destroyed my monster, but don't think I'd be dumb enough to do that without a plan! Whenever Suanni is destroyed, I'm allowed to summon another Yang Zing monster from my deck in Defense Mode to replace him!\" A card popped out of his deck and Kase quickly placed it on his disk. \"So I'll summon Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing!\" Kase's monster took the form of a crawling black dragon with a surprising amount of facial hair. It looked at Kaiba and released a sinister hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba grunted in frustration as he placed a single card on his duel disk. \"I'll end my turn with a face-down! Hurry up so I can end this duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase smirked as he drew. \"You're not ending anything, Kaiba. I'm ending this duel this turn!\" Kaiba raised an eyebrow at that, but decided to wait before making any comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase took two of his cards and sent them to the graveyard. \"First, I'll use Jiaotu's effect! Because I control no other monster, I can send two Yang Zing cards in my hand to the graveyard to Special Summon two Yang Zing monsters from my deck, one with 0 ATK and one with 0 DEF! So come forth, Suanni, Fire of the Yang Zing and Bixi, Water of the Yang Zing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud of darkness briefly erupted on either side of Jiaotu, and as his vanished it revealed the lion-headed form of Suanni and another dragon that seemed to be wearing a spiky turtle shell. Kaiba scoffed at the field. \"Big deal, so you have a lot of monsters. You pretty much said it yourself that your Yang Zing Brutality card can't be used for direct attacks, so I don't know how you plan to defeat me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase smirked. \"True, my Yang Zings can't beat you. But who said I was attacking with my Yang Zings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase flourished his hand towards his field. \"Watch and learn, Kaiba! I tune the Level 2 Jiaotu with the Level 4 Suanni and the Level 2 Bixi!\" Jiaotu dissolved, transforming into two green rings which wrapped around the other monsters, one each. Suanni and Bixi dissolved as well, transforming into 4 and 2 glowing balls of energy, respectively. As the clusters aligned, a glowing beam of light erupted in the center. \"Synchro Summon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light beam died down, a massive roar was heard. \"Mystical dragons of the stars, cast your shadows together and call upon the king of flies! Emerge from the Underworld, Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons!\" The light finally vanished for good, revealing a terrifying monster. The creature's torso seemed vaguely humanoid, and its chest had what appeared to be two massive compound eyes. A long tail tapered off from where the legs would be, and from its shoulders erupted two long necks that were topped with fierce looking dragon heads. Kaiba unknowingly took a step back as the heads glared down at him, when suddenly ghostly images of Suanni and Bixi appeared and entered the beast's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now my monster's effects! Whenever I use Suanni as Synchro material, the summoned monster gains 500 ATK! And when I use Bixi, the monster becomes immune to trap effects!\" Beelze once more roared as its ATK points increased. Kaiba, meanwhile, couldn't believe his eyes. He was about to lose to someone from some no-name business! He took a few more steps back, his arms falling to his sides, and started shaking his head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKase grinned sadistically. \"Now, Kaiba, I think it's time to end this duel! Beelze, attack him directly! Diabolic Crusher!\" The dragon's twin mouths opened and began gathering shadows. The darkness coalesced into orbs, and once the orbs had grown large enough, they were sent flying at Kaiba. As they landed, Kaiba was briefly shocked to discover he could actually <i>feel</i> the attack before he was sent flying into the wall behind him. The combined damage was enough to knock him out.</span></div></div>",
